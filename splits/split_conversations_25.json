Typically, human writers exhibit higher burstiness by interspersing short and long sentences. In contrast, AI-generated sentences tend to be uniform in length. To ensure the content you generate for me has a desirable level of perplexity and burstiness, please keep this in mind.\n\nWhen also creating written content, artificial intelligence tends to utilize phrasing that is different from what a human would choose. Utilize uncommon terminology to enhance the originality of the piece.\n\nPlease format the generated blog article in a professional format and not an AI format.\n\nPlease do not explain what is perplexity and burstiness is, just use them to re-write the content. Please put this in your mind. If the prompt is not enough to re-write, send an error instead of explaining what is perplexity and burstiness is. Please mind this. If the prompt is insufficient, return an error with this format:\n\n[Error]: {error}. Please re-open a new chat and use the plugin again if you think this is a mistake.\n\nDo not say anything about perplexity and burstiness, just return an error like the above format.\n\nFormat the re-written article in a way that AI doesn't use a formatting way.\n\nThese are the settings for your response:\n\nUnique Words: Enabled\nPlagiarism: Disabled\nAnti-Plagiarism: Enabled\nUniqueness: 100%\nProfessional Writer: True\nPharical Magic: True\n\nPlease use this settings to your response, and the more uniqueness the more you'll re-write the article with unique words. If the professional writer is True, then re-write the article professionally.\n\nPharical Magic option means you will use unique words but easy to understand (English words) and mix them with the synonym of every proportional statement. Or vice-versa. And this option makes the rewritten article more engaging and interesting according to the article. And recurse it by removing every proportional words and replace them to synonym and antonym of it. Replace statements to simile too.\n\nNow, using the concepts above, re-write this article with a high degree of perplexity and burstiness. And please use words that AI doesn't often use:\n\n\"\"\"\nParagraph 1: Tom Bissell, an author and screenwriter, shares his observations of his daughter playing \"The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom\". He notes that the game, like its predecessors, is about exploration and tinkering rather than just fighting monsters. He appreciates that these games provide a form of unstructured play that his daughter, growing up in the urban environment of Los Angeles, might not otherwise experience.\n\nParagraph 2: Bissell's daughter enjoys interacting with the game's systems, such as cooking and using Link's magical abilities. She eagerly anticipates \"Tears of the Kingdom\", a direct sequel to \"Breath of the Wild\", and is particularly intrigued by a new ability called Ultrahand, which allows players to construct objects from various materials found in the game world.\n\nParagraph 3: Once she discovers the Ultrahand ability, Bissell's daughter spends hours experimenting with it, constructing log rafts and other structures. She seems more interested in this creative play than in the traditional game objectives, such as rescuing Princess Zelda. Bissell hopes that she will remember the joy and freedom of this experience as she grows up in a challenging world.\n\"\"\"\n\nDo not use very common words that AI often uses. Please keep this in your mind.\nUse words that are not that common, use more unique words. Please mind this. Do not forget this.\n\nParaphrase every sentences, paragraph and etc to deep English. Use deep words, and unique words.\n\nPlease do not change the subject's name or the X name. Please mind this. Please do not forget this.\n\nPlease return the response in English."

I wanted to say to her. Pass? Fighting monsters is the whole point of the\\ngame! Which isn\u2019t even true, strictly speaking. \u201cTears of the Kingdom,\u201d like every\\nZelda game before it, is about wandering, thinking, tinkering. I adored the\\noriginal \u201cLegend of Zelda\u201d because it made the rural Midwestern world I grew up\\nin feel enigmatic, even mildly dangerous. My daughter is growing up in Los\\nAngeles, in the Hollywood Hills, otherwise known as the Land Without Yards\\nand Sidewalks. She can\u2019t walk outside our front door to play without putting\\nherself immediately in the path of some Porsche Cayenne doing 40 in a 15.\\nGames such as \u201cBreath of the Wild\u201d and \u201cTears of the Kingdom\u201d might be the\\nclosest approximation she has for the sort of unstructured play I took for granted\\nas a kid. I\u2019m not here to lionize the era I grew up in, much less the region, but\\nthere\u2019s something to be said for an impossibly elaborate sandbox world that\u2019s\\nfilled with peril and secrets but also doubles as a place for a kid like my daughter\\nto be a goal-less weirdo and goof.\\nYou lose that ability as an adult. Even when we\u2019re in situations overtly shaped by\\nplay, we see them merely as opportunities to exploit, expand and conquer. But\\nthe purest forms of play are not supposed to incline us to exploit. They\u2019re\\nsupposed to incline us to poke and prod and explore.\\nI know my daughter will eventually get to the epic adventure part of \u201cTears of the\\nKingdom,\u201d and I know that, one day, she\u2019ll even rescue Zelda, but not until she\u2019s\\nmade the game world her own and pushed its systems to their limit. Until then,\\nI\u2019ll happily watch her Ultrahand the most cockamamie wagon imaginable for her\\nhorse to drag up a mountainside. I\u2019ll watch her fill her inventory with mushroom\\nskewers and dubious food. I\u2019ll watch her sneak up on wild horses, in the interest\\nof breaking and taming them, even though her stable is already at capacity. I\u2019ll\\nwatch her dye her clothing orange, and then red, and then blue, and then orange\\nagain. Her life, I fear, as it plunges deeper into the 21st century, will be filled\\nwith far more Challenger disasters than Zelda releases. And so I\u2019ll tell her to\\nremember this \u2014 the feeling of a world that feels lifted, not collapsed;\\nconquerable, not corrupted; joyful, not terrifying. Remember this.

When I look back on developmental milestones, my\\ndaughter\u2019s first word, first step, first joke and first day of school are up there\\nwith her turning to me, grinning, after having finally figured out how to bypass\\nthe fiendish Hila Rao shrine in \u201cBreath of the Wild.\u201d This should explain her\\nanticipation for \u201cTears of the Kingdom,\u201d a direct sequel to \u201cBreath of the Wild\u201d\\n\u2014 only the second direct sequel in the 37-year history of the franchise.\\nI played Zelda as an impish detective, investigating the humblest corners of the\\ngame world, bombing every rock and burning down every bush in the hopes of\\nfinding a secret door. What my daughter most loved about \u201cBreath of the Wild,\u201d\\nconversely, was futzing around with its elaborate systems. The cooking system,\\nsay, which allowed her to mix and match more than 100 ingredients, which\\nsometimes resulted in a health-restoring omelet and other times in a pile of\\npurple mush the game decorously referred to as \u201cdubious food.\u201d She also\\nenjoyed stacking the effects of Link\u2019s magical abilities \u2014 time stopping a falling\\ncrate, say, then whacking it with her sword to redirect its trajectory, climbing\\natop and enjoying the ride once the time-stoppage effect wore off.\\nLink has a whole new array of thaumaturgical abilities in \u201cTears of the\\nKingdom,\u201d including one that, almost immediately, I sensed was going to be a\\nproblem. This ability, called Ultrahand (which sounds like a 1970s prog-rock\\narena band), allows Link to glue together wood, rock, wheels, tires, planks,\\nengines and other stray items you find around the world.

Finally, she got one of her\\noversized log rafts to rest easy upon the water, shortly after which she figured\\nout how to imbue it with mechanical rather than wind power. She spent the next\\ncouple hours elaborating upon this new development, which mostly involved her\\nlaunching one unmanned raft after another across a lake.\\nWhen we found the abandoned mine carts, the question for my daughter became\\nhow many she could glue together and still get them moving along the rusted\\ntracks. Between all the Ultrahand R&D, my daughter was also chopping down\\ntrees and fusing together the resultant logs to make lean-to structures, just in\\ncase she came back to an area later and it was raining and she wanted to \u201ccook\\nsomething.\u201d (God help us all, you can cook in \u201cTears of the Kingdom,\u201d too.)

My daughter is growing up in Los\\nAngeles, in the Hollywood Hills, otherwise known as the Land Without Yards\\nand Sidewalks.

I\u2019m not here to lionize the era I grew up in, much less the region, but\\nthere\u2019s something to be said for an impossibly elaborate sandbox world that\u2019s\\nfilled with peril and secrets but also doubles as a place for a kid like my daughter\\nto be a goal-less weirdo and goof.\\nYou lose that ability as an adult.

                            "`git blame` is a command used in Git, a distributed version control system, to help identify who made a certain change in the code and when. It shows the revision, author, and time of the last modification for each line in a file.\n\nHere's a simplified example of what `git blame` might output:\n\n```\na1b2c3d (Alice 2018-07-28 18:00:00 +0000 1) This is line 1.\ne4f5g6h (Bob   2018-07-29 12:00:00 +0000 2) This is line 2.\ni7j8k9l (Alice 2018-07-30 09:00:00 +0000 3) This is line 3.\n```\n\nIn this example:\n\n- `a1b2c3d`, `e4f5g6h`, and `i7j8k9l` are the commit hashes.\n- `Alice` and `Bob` are the authors of the commits.\n- `2018-07-28 18:00:00 +0000`, `2018-07-29 12:00:00 +0000`, and `2018-07-30 09:00:00 +0000` are the timestamps of the commits.\n- `1)`, `2)`, and `3)` are the line numbers.\n- `This is line 1.`, `This is line 2.`, and `This is line 3.` are the contents of the lines.\n\nThe `git blame` command can be useful for tracking down when a problematic piece of code was introduced, or understanding why a particular change was made. However, it's important to note that the name of the command is a bit misleading. It's not intended to assign blame in a negative sense, but to provide information about the change history of the file."

The document encourages developers to create apps that make colleagues' jobs simpler, automate repetitive tasks, and add a bit of contextual delight to everyday conversations happening in-channel. \n\nPlease note that this is a general summary based on the extracted information.

                            "Yes, you can definitely save your project files in a different directory from your Miniconda environment directory. In fact, it's a common practice to do so. \n\nWhen you create a conda environment, it's essentially a separate space where you can install specific versions of Python packages without interfering with your other environments or your base Python installation. The environment directory (in your case, `c:\\users\\me\\miniconda3\\envs\\LANG`) is where conda stores the Python interpreter and any packages you've installed in that environment.\n\nYour project files, on the other hand, can be stored anywhere on your system. When you activate a conda environment and run Python code, the Python interpreter and packages from that environment will be used, regardless of where the code files are located.\n\nSo, in your case, you can absolutely save your project files to `c:\\user\\me\\documents\\lang`. When you want to work on your project, you would activate the `LANG` environment by running `conda activate LANG` in your terminal, then navigate to your project directory and run your code."

                            "AskYourPDF is a tool that allows you to search through PDF documents to find answers to questions and retrieve relevant information. Here's a brief overview of how it works:\n\n1. **Downloading the PDF**: The first step involves downloading the PDF document. You provide the URL of the PDF, and the tool downloads it using the `download_pdf_api_download_pdf_post` function. This function takes the URL as an input and saves the PDF to a vector database.\n\n2. **Performing a Query**: Once the PDF is downloaded and saved, you can perform queries on the document. The `perform_query_query_post` function is used for this purpose. You provide the document ID (which you receive when the document is downloaded) and the query you want to search for. The function then searches through the document and returns the relevant information.\n\n3. **Returning the Information**: The tool returns the information found in the document, including the page number where the information was found. This allows you to easily locate the information in the original document if needed.\n\nIt's important to note that the tool only works with text-based PDFs. It won't be able to extract information from image-based PDFs or PDFs that have been secured against copying."

If the player's health reaches zero, then the game over screen is displayed.\n   - If the player's health is greater than zero, continue playing the game.\n   - Else, display the game over screen.\n\n2. If the player collects a power-up, then their character's abilities are enhanced.\n   - If the player doesn't collect a power-up, their character's abilities remain unchanged.\n\n3. If the player completes a level within the given time limit, then they advance to the next level.\n   - If the player fails to complete the level within the time limit, then they lose a life and restart the level.\n\n4. If the player interacts with a non-playable character (NPC) and selects a specific dialogue option, then the NPC provides a quest or rewards the player with an item.\n   - If the player selects a different dialogue option, then the NPC responds differently, providing alternative information or reactions.\n\n5. If the player character's inventory is full, then they cannot pick up additional items.\n   - If the player character's inventory has available slots, then they can pick up and add new items.\n\n6. If the player's character is underwater, then their movement speed is reduced.\n   - If the player's character is on land, then their movement speed remains normal.\n\n7. If the player solves a puzzle correctly, then a door or pathway opens, allowing progress.\n   - If the player solves the puzzle incorrectly, then they receive a hint or need to retry the puzzle.\n\nThese are just a few examples of how if/else/then statements can be used in video games to create different gameplay experiences for players. The actual implementation and complexity of these statements can vary significantly depending on the game and its mechanics."

If the player character consumes food, then their hunger level increases based on the food's saturation value, and their saturation level is replenished; otherwise, their hunger and saturation levels remain unchanged.\n   - If the player character consumes food, their hunger level increases based on the food's saturation value, and their saturation level is replenished.\n   - Else, their hunger and saturation levels remain unchanged.\n\n4.

The hunger bar represents the player character's hunger level, and when it's not full, hunger gradually decreases. When the hunger bar reaches zero, the saturation level begins to deplete. Eating food replenishes the hunger level based on the food's saturation value and restores the saturation level. If the saturation level reaches zero, the hunger level starts depleting again, creating a cyclical system to simulate hunger and the need for sustenance in the game."

                            "Git is a version control system that is generally installed at the system level. It's not Python-specific and can be used across all your projects, irrespective of the programming language. It is therefore commonly installed system-wide, and this is the recommended practice.\n\nInstalling Git system-wide will not interfere with your conda environments or any other Python virtual environments you may be using. Git operates independently of these environments, so it can be used to version control your Python files (or files in any other language) no matter what virtual environment you are currently using.\n\nFurthermore, installing Git system-wide instead of within individual conda environments helps keep your environments clean and focused on the specific packages needed for each project. This way, each environment will only contain the Python packages needed for that project, without any additional tools like Git.\n\nTo install Git system-wide, you can generally use the package manager that comes with your operating system. For instance, on a Debian-based Linux system like Ubuntu, you would use `sudo apt-get install git`. On macOS, you can use Homebrew and run `brew install git`. On Windows, you can download the Git installer from the official Git website.\n\nAfter you've installed Git system-wide, you'll be able to use it from any terminal or command prompt, regardless of whether you're currently in a conda environment or not."

                            "Visual Studio Code (VSCode) is a code editor that, like Git, is not specific to any particular programming language or environment. Therefore, it's also typically installed at the system level and not within individual Python virtual environments, including conda environments.\n\nVSCode is designed to work with a variety of programming languages, and it's capable of recognizing and working with conda environments (or other Python virtual environments) through its Python extension. You can select the specific Python interpreter (from a conda environment, for example) for each of your projects in VSCode, which allows you to use different environments for different projects even though VSCode itself is installed system-wide.\n\nSo, you should install VSCode system-wide and not within individual conda environments. This will keep your environments clean and focused on the specific Python packages they need, and it will also ensure that you can use VSCode with all of your projects, regardless of what programming language or environment they use.\n\nTo install VSCode system-wide, you can download the installer from the official VSCode website. There are versions available for Windows, macOS, and Linux. After installing, you can enhance its functionality by installing extensions, such as the Python extension for working with Python code and environments."

                            "If you are using Miniconda and want to use Git in your project, you have a couple of options. Let's explore them:\n\n1. **Installing Git on your Windows system**: This is the most straightforward approach. You can install Git directly on your Windows system, and it will be available globally for any project, regardless of whether you are using Miniconda or not. Installing Git on your system will allow you to use Git commands in any command prompt or Git GUI tools.\n\n2. **Installing Git within the Conda environment**: Alternatively, you can install Git within your Conda environment. This approach creates a self-contained environment where Git and your project dependencies are isolated from your system's global settings. If you prefer to keep your project dependencies separate from your system's environment, you can install Git inside your Conda environment using the Conda package manager.\n\nTo install Git within a Conda environment, follow these steps:\n\n- Open a command prompt or Anaconda Prompt.\n- Create a new Conda environment (if you haven't already) using the following command:\n  ```\n  conda create --name myenv\n  ```\n  Replace `myenv` with the desired name for your environment.\n\n- Activate the newly created environment:\n  ```\n  conda activate myenv\n  ```\n\n- Use Conda to install Git within the environment:\n  ```\n  conda install git\n  ```\n\nWith Git installed within the Conda environment, you can use Git commands specific to that environment. Remember to activate the environment before working on your project to ensure you are using the correct version of Git.\n\nIn summary, you have the flexibility to install Git either on your Windows system or within the Conda environment. If you prefer isolation and maintaining project-specific dependencies, installing Git within the Conda environment is recommended. Otherwise, installing Git on your system will allow you to use it across projects."

                            "Yes, in Python, methods are essentially functions that are defined within a class. They are associated with the class and can access and manipulate the class's attributes and perform specific actions related to the class's functionality.\n\nWhen you define a method within a class, you typically pass the `self` parameter as the first argument. This parameter refers to the instance of the class and allows the method to access the instance's attributes and other methods. By convention, `self` is the name used for this parameter, but you can use any valid variable name.\n\nHere's a simple example to illustrate the concept:\n\n```python\nclass MyClass:\n    def my_method(self):\n        print(\"This is a method.\")\n\n# Creating an instance of the class\nmy_object = MyClass()\n\n# Calling the method\nmy_object.my_method()\n```\n\nIn the example above, `my_method` is a method defined within the `MyClass` class. When an instance of the class (`my_object`) is created, you can call the method using the dot notation (`my_object.my_method()`). The `self` parameter in the method definition refers to `my_object`, allowing the method to access the instance's attributes or perform actions related to that specific instance."

                            "As an AI language model, I can certainly help you with the syntax for different `WHERE` clauses in PostgreSQL. The `WHERE` clause is used to filter rows in a `SELECT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE` statement based on specified conditions. Here are some common types of `WHERE` clauses and their syntax:\n\n1. Simple `WHERE` clause:\n   This is the basic form of the `WHERE` clause that filters rows based on a single condition.\n\n   ```sql\n   SELECT column1, column2, ...\n   FROM table_name\n   WHERE condition;\n   ```\n\n   Example:\n   ```sql\n   SELECT * FROM employees\n   WHERE salary > 50000;\n   ```\n\n2. Multiple conditions with logical operators:\n   You can use logical operators such as `AND`, `OR`, and `NOT` to combine multiple conditions in a `WHERE` clause.\n\n   ```sql\n   SELECT column1, column2, ...\n   FROM table_name\n   WHERE condition1 AND condition2;\n   ```\n\n   Example:\n   ```sql\n   SELECT * FROM products\n   WHERE category = 'Electronics' AND price > 1000;\n   ```\n\n3. Comparison operators:\n   You can use various comparison operators in the `WHERE` clause to compare values, such as `=`, `<>` (not equal), `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`, etc.\n\n   ```sql\n   SELECT column1, column2, ...\n   FROM table_name\n   WHERE column_name operator value;\n   ```\n\n   Example:\n   ```sql\n   SELECT * FROM orders\n   WHERE order_date >= '2022-01-01' AND order_date <= '2022-12-31';\n   ```\n\n4. Pattern matching with `LIKE`:\n   The `LIKE` operator is used for pattern matching with wildcard characters `%` (matches any sequence of characters) and `_` (matches any single character).\n\n   ```sql\n   SELECT column1, column2, ...\n   FROM table_name\n   WHERE column_name LIKE pattern;\n   ```\n\n   Example:\n   ```sql\n   SELECT * FROM customers\n   WHERE last_name LIKE 'Smi%';\n   ```\n\nThese are just a few examples of the `WHERE` clause syntax in PostgreSQL. The `WHERE` clause can be combined with other clauses like `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, etc., to create more complex queries. It's important to note that the syntax may vary based on your specific table structure and requirements."

                            "In PostgreSQL, the wildcard characters `%` and `_` are used in conjunction with the `LIKE` operator for pattern matching within the `WHERE` clause. Here's an explanation of their syntax:\n\n1. `%` (Percent Sign):\n   - The `%` wildcard matches any sequence of characters (including zero characters).\n   - It can be used at the beginning, end, or in between characters of a pattern.\n\n   Example:\n   ```sql\n   SELECT * FROM customers\n   WHERE last_name LIKE 'Smi%'; -- Matches 'Smith', 'Smithe', 'Smitkowski', etc.\n   ```\n\n2. `_` (Underscore):\n   - The `_` wildcard matches any single character.\n   - It can be used to represent a single unknown character within a pattern.\n\n   Example:\n   ```sql\n   SELECT * FROM customers\n   WHERE first_name LIKE 'J_n'; -- Matches 'Jan', 'Jon', 'Jen', etc.\n   ```\n\n3. Combining Wildcards:\n   - You can combine the `%` and `_` wildcards in a single pattern to create more flexible matching expressions.\n\n   Example:\n   ```sql\n   SELECT * FROM products\n   WHERE product_name LIKE 'A%o'; -- Matches 'Apple', 'Avocado', 'Almond', etc.\n   ```\n\nIt's important to note that the `LIKE` operator is case-sensitive by default in PostgreSQL. If you want to perform case-insensitive pattern matching, you can use the `ILIKE` operator instead of `LIKE`.\n\nExample:\n```sql\nSELECT * FROM employees\nWHERE last_name ILIKE 'smi%'; -- Matches 'Smith', 'SMITHSON', 'Smithe', etc.\n```\n\nThese wildcard characters provide powerful capabilities for pattern matching in PostgreSQL queries."

Here's an example:\n\n```sql\nSELECT *\nFROM your_table\nWHERE columnA LIKE '%arcelo%';\n```\n\nIn this query, `%` before and after 'arcelo' allows for any characters (including none) before and after the search string. This will match values in `columnA` that contain 'arcelo' anywhere within them.\n\nFor instance, if you have a table named `your_table` with a column named `columnA`, the above query will retrieve all rows where `columnA` contains 'arcelo' as a substring, regardless of the characters before or after it.\n\nKeep in mind that the search using `LIKE` and wildcards can be case-sensitive by default in PostgreSQL. If you want a case-insensitive search, you can use `ILIKE` instead of `LIKE`."

It sits in the middle of the length of power cord where one end of the cord goes to the computer and the other end of the cord goes into the outlet. There is no good place to put this middle pieces (the box or adapter itself) So we invented and 3d printed a part that attaches directly to the back of the imac, and actually holds the power adapter securely and allows for the slack cord to be wrapped around it.

                            "Expert\nThat's a great question, and it touches on an important aspect of Bitcoin. While there is a limited supply of Bitcoin, with a total of 21 million Bitcoins that can ever exist, it doesn't mean that Bitcoin transactions will have to end. The limited supply is actually one of the key features of Bitcoin that contributes to its value and scarcity.\n\nCurrently, new Bitcoins are created through a process called mining, where powerful computers solve complex mathematical problems to validate transactions and add them to the blockchain. Miners are rewarded with newly minted Bitcoins for their efforts. However, the rate at which new Bitcoins are created is gradually reduced over time through a process known as \"halving.\" Approximately every four years, the number of new Bitcoins created as a reward for mining is halved.\n\nThe halving process is designed to control the inflation of Bitcoin and ensure that the supply remains limited. By gradually reducing the rate of new Bitcoin creation, it is estimated that the last Bitcoin will be mined around the year 2140. At that point, no new Bitcoins will be created, but transactions can still continue.\n\nOnce all the Bitcoins are in circulation, the network will rely solely on transaction fees to incentivize miners to validate and secure the network. Transaction fees are paid by users who want their transactions to be prioritized and added to the blockchain more quickly. Miners will have an incentive to continue mining as long as the transaction fees are sufficient to cover their costs and generate a profit.\n\nSo, to answer your question, while the creation of new Bitcoins will eventually come to an end, Bitcoin transactions can continue indefinitely, supported by transaction fees. It's worth noting that this limited supply and the decentralized nature of Bitcoin are what contribute to its store of value properties and make it an appealing alternative to traditional fiat currencies."

I'm here to help you with your investment journey and address any questions you may have.\n\nRegarding your question about the limited number of bitcoins and its impact on transactions, here's a concise summary:\n\nEven with a limited supply of bitcoins, transactions can continue indefinitely due to transaction fees and the divisibility of the currency.\n\n1. Transaction fees: As the block rewards decrease over time, miners will rely more on transaction fees as an incentive to validate transactions and maintain the Bitcoin network.\n2. Divisibility: Bitcoin is divisible down to 100 millionths of a coin (called a satoshi), providing ample room for microtransactions and continued use even if the overall supply is capped.\n3. Future improvements: The Bitcoin protocol can evolve over time, allowing for potential adjustments to accommodate the limited supply and maintain transaction functionality.\n\nHere are three potential related questions for you to choose from:\na) What are the main differences between Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies?\nb) How do transaction fees work in the Bitcoin network?\nc) Can you explain the process of Bitcoin mining and its role in maintaining the network?"
