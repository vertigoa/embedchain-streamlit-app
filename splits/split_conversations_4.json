                            "Charter schools in the United States can be both non-profit and for-profit, depending on the school and the state in which it operates. The majority of charter schools are non-profit entities. These non-profit charter schools are typically set up by groups of educators, parents, or community organizations and are publically funded but operate independently of the public school system.\n\nHowever, there are also for-profit charter schools, which are run by for-profit companies. These schools are less common than non-profit charters. The presence and proportion of for-profit charter schools vary by state, as state laws and regulations dictate how charter schools can be established and managed. For example, some states do not allow for-profit organizations to run charter schools, while others do.\n\nIn both cases, charter schools are subject to oversight and accountability standards, although these can also vary by state."

State education departments use them to provide guidance to each public K-12 school district and charter school as they create their own courses. State standards also influence what textbook authors write and what assessment companies such as the College Board test for in their advanced placement examinations. They affect teacher training and they provide the framework for teachers\u2019 individual lesson plans. Private schools and homeschool parents also keep an eye on state standards.\n\nThe Civics Alliance wants to improve every aspect of American social studies instruction by inspiring America\u2019s state education departments to provide social studies standards that teach American students their birthright of liberty.\n\nEvery student should be educated to be another Harry Truman\u2014a high-school graduate who, without ever graduating from college, has a solid grasp of history and is capable of serving as an officer, a judge, a senator, and president.\n\nAmerican Birthright teaches students to identify the ideals, institutions, and individual examples of human liberty, individualism, religious freedom, and republican self-government; assess the extent to which civilizations have fulfilled these ideals; and describe how the evolution of these ideals in different times and places has contributed to the formation of modern American ideals.\n\nAbove all, American Birthright teaches about the expansion of American liberty to include all Americans, the contributions that Americans from every walk of life have made to our shared history of liberty, and America\u2019s championship of liberty throughout the world. Students will learn of heroes of liberty such as Abraham Lincoln, Susan B. Anthony, Martin Luther King, Jr., and Ronald Reagan.\n\nAmerican Birthright will prepare our children for college and career because it provides comprehensive content knowledge in History, Geography, Civics, and Economics, as well as sustained coverage of Western Civilization, World History, United States History, and Civics. American Birthright integrates its standards with a series of primary source documents, so students can learn the actual materials of history. American Birthright\u2019s straightforward structure makes it easy for teachers to use and easy for parents to hold teachers accountable for how well they teach social studies. American Birthright\u2019s intensive content standards also facilitate reliable assessment, whether by state-level testing or tests by school districts and individual teachers.\n\nAmerican Birthright will especially benefit the most disadvantaged students. Disadvantaged students benefit from intensive content instruction even more than better-off students, who receive large amounts of content knowledge from their families and peers. Content standards that abbreviate content foster an unequal society because they especially harm the education of disadvantaged children. American Birthright\u2019s intensive content standards fulfill America\u2019s promise of equal educational opportunities for everyone.\n\nThe Civics Alliance has sent letters to every governor and every state superintendent of education, informing them about American Birthright. We encourage all citizens to get in touch with these officials, to call for adopting some or all of American Birthright as a state social studies standard.",

Nationwide, one third or more of fourth and eighth graders were proficient in math and reading on the most recent NAEP, while only 27 percent of fourth graders and 22 percent of eighth graders were proficient in civics.

The reports raise interesting questions about whether charter schools are doing anything different than traditional public schools, and whether charter schools can be laboratories of innovation for incorporating civics education back into schools. Two organizations have spearheaded the research on civics in charter schools: the American Enterprise Institute (AEI) and the Center on Education Policy (CEP). Despite ideological differences between the two organizations, there is commonality in the belief that schools should teach civics in order to prepare students to be productive citizens:  \nL254: AEI: \u201cA resurgence in civics could stem\u2014and perhaps even reverse\u2026 the polarization of U.S. politics and thus the paralysis of the government\u2026 If subpar academics in U.S. schools can cause economic problems, then couldn\u2019t subpar civics education cause political problems?\u201d  \nL255: CEP: \u201cIt is often said that well-informed citizens are at the cornerstone of a strong democracy. Without even a basic knowledge of government, history and a citizen\u2019s role in promoting and defending a robust democracy, individuals are hamstrung in understanding their own rights and the rights of others.\u201d  \nL256: So what did the studies find? In a January 2012 report, Strengthening the Civic Mission of Charter Schools, Robin Lake of the Center on Reinventing Public Education and AEI\u2019s Cheryl Miller highlight the following:  \nL257: There is not a common definition of civics education among public charter school leaders sampled; nor is there a common belief about why civics education and preparedness is important, the skills that need to be taught, or the teaching methods that work best. Charter leaders generally dislike traditional civics education resources, such as textbooks and curricula, and prefer to use civic activism to make civics education relevant to students.  \nL258: The authors provide recommendations for charter school funders, authorizers, and advocacy groups that focus on ways that these groups can help charter schools improve civics education.  \nL259: AEI followed-up the 2012 report with three case studies from public charter school networks that keep civics education at the heart of their educational practices:\nL260: \nL261: Democracy Prep: The network\u2019s motto is, \u201cWork hard. Go to college.

UNO school leaders believe that the goal of the network is in creating \u201cnot just educated and engaged citizens, but educated and engaged American citizens.\u201d  \nL266: The recent CEP study, Civic Education and Charter Schools: Current Knowledge and Future Research Issues, examines the NAEP civics assessment to compare charter schools and traditional public schools on civics achievement and school instructional practices.  \nL267: Overall, the study finds little difference in civics performance between students who attend charter schools and students who attend traditional public schools. There were a couple of differences, like 8th grade Hispanic students and male 12th graders in charter schools outperforming students in traditional public schools.  \nL268: There were some differences in how civics education was taught in the two types of schools. A higher percentage of eighth grade charter students reported taking part in role play, mock trials, and dramas. Eighth graders and 12th graders in charter schools reported answering more questions daily about social studies than students in traditional public schools.  \nL269: The study highlights the need for better data on student performance and the teaching of civics education.  \nL270: Image via Google Images\nL271: \nL272: ## Share the Blog\nL273: \nL274: Add RSS\nL275: \nL276: ### More Like This\nL277: \nL278: ##### \u301024\u2020Charter Schools Innovate Using Federal Teacher and School Leader Incentive Fund Grants\u3011\nL279: \nL280: ##### \u301025\u2020How the Empower Charter School Educators to Lead Act Supports Equity and Innovation\u3011\nL281: \nL282: ##### \u301026\u2020How My Hispanic Heritage Drives Me to Push for Change\u3011\nL283: \nL284: ##### \u301027\u2020How Charter Schools Used ESSER Funds\u3011\nL285: \nL286: ##### \u301057\u20205 Ways Charter Schools Help Boost Students\u2019 Mental Health\u3011\nL287: \nL288: ### See More\nL289: \nL290: [Image 11: Charter Schools Innovate Using Federal Teacher and School Leader Incentive Fund Grants]  [Image 12: Charter Schools Innovate Using Federal Teacher and School Leader Incentive Fund Grants] \nL291: \nL292: ###### \u301024\u2020Charter Schools Innovate Using Federal Teacher and School Leader Incentive Fund Grants\u3011\nL293: \nL294: [Image 13: How the Empower Charter School Educators to Lead Act Supports Equity and Innovation\nVisible: 31% - 60%",

Two organizations have spearheaded the research on civics in charter schools: the American Enterprise Institute (AEI) and the Center on Education Policy (CEP).

In a January 2012 report, Strengthening the Civic Mission of Charter Schools, Robin Lake of the Center on Reinventing Public Education and AEI\u2019s Cheryl Miller highlight the following:  \nThere is not a common definition of civics education among public charter school leaders sampled; nor is there a common belief about why civics education and preparedness is important, the skills that need to be taught, or the teaching methods that work best. Charter leaders generally dislike traditional civics education resources, such as textbooks and curricula, and prefer to use civic activism to make civics education relevant to students.  \nThe authors provide recommendations for charter school funders, authorizers, and advocacy groups that focus on ways that these groups can help charter schools improve civics education.  \nAEI followed-up the 2012 report with three case studies from public charter school networks that keep civics education at the heart of their educational practices:\n\nDemocracy Prep: The network\u2019s motto is, \u201cWork hard.

There were a couple of differences, like 8th grade Hispanic students and male 12th graders in charter schools outperforming students in traditional public schools.  \nThere were some differences in how civics education was taught in the two types of schools.

                            "The Civics Alliance, which created the American Birthright Standards, is a coalition aimed at improving America's civics education. These standards are designed to influence state education departments in providing social studies standards that teach American students about liberty, individualism, religious freedom, and republican self-government. They are intended to be adopted as state social studies standards and can influence public K-12 schools, including charter schools, in their curriculum development\u301011\u2020source\u3011.\n\nRegarding charter schools and their connection to the Civics Alliance or the American Birthright Standards, there's no specific evidence indicating a direct association between them. However, charter schools often seek innovative approaches to education, including civics education. For example, organizations like the American Enterprise Institute (AEI) and the Center on Education Policy (CEP) have conducted research on civics education in charter schools. They found that charter schools have different approaches and beliefs regarding civics education, and some networks, such as Democracy Prep and National Heritage Academies, have emphasized civics education in their curricula\u301017\u2020source\u3011.\n\nIn summary, while there is no direct evidence of a connection between the Civics Alliance or the American Birthright Standards and charter schools, the nature of charter schools as independent public schools allows them the flexibility to adopt various educational standards, including those related to civics education."

State education departments use them to provide guidance to each public K-12 school district and charter school as they create their own courses. State standards also influence what textbook authors write and what assessment companies such as the College Board test for in their advanced placement examinations. They affect teacher training and they provide the framework for teachers\u2019 individual lesson plans. Private schools and homeschool parents also keep an eye on state standards.\n\nThe Civics Alliance wants to improve every aspect of American social studies instruction by inspiring America\u2019s state education departments to provide social studies standards that teach American students their birthright of liberty.\n\nEvery student should be educated to be another Harry Truman\u2014a high-school graduate who, without ever graduating from college, has a solid grasp of history and is capable of serving as an officer, a judge, a senator, and president.\n\nAmerican Birthright teaches students to identify the ideals, institutions, and individual examples of human liberty, individualism, religious freedom, and republican self-government; assess the extent to which civilizations have fulfilled these ideals; and describe how the evolution of these ideals in different times and places has contributed to the formation of modern American ideals.\n\nAbove all, American Birthright teaches about the expansion of American liberty to include all Americans, the contributions that Americans from every walk of life have made to our shared history of liberty, and America\u2019s championship of liberty throughout the world. Students will learn of heroes of liberty such as Abraham Lincoln, Susan B. Anthony, Martin Luther King, Jr., and Ronald Reagan.\n\nAmerican Birthright will prepare our children for college and career because it provides comprehensive content knowledge in History, Geography, Civics, and Economics, as well as sustained coverage of Western Civilization, World History, United States History, and Civics. American Birthright integrates its standards with a series of primary source documents, so students can learn the actual materials of history. American Birthright\u2019s straightforward structure makes it easy for teachers to use and easy for parents to hold teachers accountable for how well they teach social studies. American Birthright\u2019s intensive content standards also facilitate reliable assessment, whether by state-level testing or tests by school districts and individual teachers.\n\nAmerican Birthright will especially benefit the most disadvantaged students. Disadvantaged students benefit from intensive content instruction even more than better-off students, who receive large amounts of content knowledge from their families and peers. Content standards that abbreviate content foster an unequal society because they especially harm the education of disadvantaged children. American Birthright\u2019s intensive content standards fulfill America\u2019s promise of equal educational opportunities for everyone.\n\nThe Civics Alliance has sent letters to every governor and every state superintendent of education, informing them about American Birthright. We encourage all citizens to get in touch with these officials, to call for adopting some or all of American Birthright as a state social studies standard.",

                                    "text": "Over the last couple of years, a series of reports have focused attention on the teaching of civics education in public charter schools. The reports raise interesting questions about whether charter schools are doing anything different than traditional public schools, and whether charter schools can be laboratories of innovation for incorporating civics education back into schools. Two organizations have spearheaded the research on civics in charter schools: the American Enterprise Institute (AEI) and the Center on Education Policy (CEP). Despite ideological differences between the two organizations, there is commonality in the belief that schools should teach civics in order to prepare students to be productive citizens:  \nAEI: \u201cA resurgence in civics could stem\u2014and perhaps even reverse\u2026 the polarization of U.S. politics and thus the paralysis of the government\u2026 If subpar academics in U.S. schools can cause economic problems, then couldn\u2019t subpar civics education cause political problems?\u201d  \nCEP: \u201cIt is often said that well-informed citizens are at the cornerstone of a strong democracy. Without even a basic knowledge of government, history and a citizen\u2019s role in promoting and defending a robust democracy, individuals are hamstrung in understanding their own rights and the rights of others.\u201d  \nSo what did the studies find? In a January 2012 report, Strengthening the Civic Mission of Charter Schools, Robin Lake of the Center on Reinventing Public Education and AEI\u2019s Cheryl Miller highlight the following:  \nThere is not a common definition of civics education among public charter school leaders sampled; nor is there a common belief about why civics education and preparedness is important, the skills that need to be taught, or the teaching methods that work best. Charter leaders generally dislike traditional civics education resources, such as textbooks and curricula, and prefer to use civic activism to make civics education relevant to students.  \nThe authors provide recommendations for charter school funders, authorizers, and advocacy groups that focus on ways that these groups can help charter schools improve civics education.  \nAEI followed-up the 2012 report with three case studies from public charter school networks that keep civics education at the heart of their educational practices:\n\nDemocracy Prep: The network\u2019s motto is, \u201cWork hard. Go to college. Change the world!\u201d The network places civics education at the core of its mission by teaching students about the details of civics knowledge, as well as action-oriented civics skills.\n\nNational Heritage Academies: In National Heritage Academies, civics education is interpreted as moral and character education with the premise that good character leads to good citizens.\n\nUNO Charter School Network: The UNO network of charter schools uses civics education to help with the assimilation and Americanization of the schools\u2019 largely Latino and immigrant student population. UNO school leaders believe that the goal of the network is in creating \u201cnot just educated and engaged citizens, but educated and engaged American citizens.\u201d  \nThe recent CEP study, Civic Education and Charter Schools: Current Knowledge and Future Research Issues, examines the NAEP civics assessment to compare charter schools and traditional public schools on civics achievement and school instructional practices.  \nOverall, the study finds little difference in civics performance between students who attend charter schools and students who attend traditional public schools. There were a couple of differences, like 8th grade Hispanic students and male 12th graders in charter schools outperforming students in traditional public schools.  \nThere were some differences in how civics education was taught in the two types of schools. A higher percentage of eighth grade charter students reported taking part in role play, mock trials, and dramas. Eighth graders and 12th graders in charter schools reported answering more questions daily about social studies than students in traditional public schools.  ",

                            "Your observation about the dynamics of educational policy and market creation isn't necessarily a conspiracy theory; it's a perspective on how different education-related organizations and initiatives might operate within the broader education system. \n\nIn the context of education, various organizations and initiatives, including those like the Civics Alliance, American Birthright, and charter schools, often propose alternatives to the existing public education system. They might emphasize perceived shortcomings in the current system to highlight the need for their approach or solutions. This tactic is not uncommon in many sectors where new ideas or reforms are introduced, as it helps to establish a market or demand for these new ideas.\n\nHowever, it's essential to differentiate between legitimate criticism and efforts to improve education from actions that might intentionally undermine public education for personal or ideological gain. Critiques of public education can be based on genuine concerns about educational outcomes, teaching methods, or curriculum content. At the same time, it's possible for some entities to have motives that are more self-serving or ideologically driven.\n\nIt's crucial to look at the specific actions and statements of these organizations, the evidence they present, and the broader context of their activities. This approach can help in assessing whether their criticisms are part of a constructive dialogue about improving education or if they might be serving other agendas.\n\nIn summary, while it's wise to be critical and analytical about the motives and actions of different educational organizations and initiatives, labeling it as a conspiracy without substantial evidence would be an overreach. It's more about understanding the complexities and competing interests in the field of education policy."

However, Board President Tony May pulled the discussion item from the agenda after learning a local committee was going to recommend the board instead adopt the state social studies standards. Pulling the item from the agenda enraged community members who packed the boardroom Wednesday night. \nL52: \nL53: Twenty-nine speakers spoke in support \u2014 two did not \u2014 of the state-adopted standards. One called the Birthright standards \u201creligiously and politically charged,\u201d and many spoke of their fatigue over political battles at school board meetings.\nL54: \nL55: \u201cOver the last year I\u2019ve watched the priorities change from doing whatever it takes to help every child to fighting meaningless culture wars and pushing radical agendas that do not benefit or even reflect the interests and needs of the community,\u201d said Celeste Kratzer, who grew up in Rifle and now teaches at Rifle Middle School.\nL56: \nL57: ### Residents of different backgrounds came together\nL58: \nL59: But what most struck community members was how a social studies review committee composed of residents from different political and economic backgrounds, faiths and beliefs agreed on recommendations for the board.\nL60: \nL61: Garfield County is a conservative county on the Western Slope, and the school district student body is more than half Latino. \nL62: \nL63: \u201cEveryone came together to hash it out, to really figure out what the community of this district really wanted,\u201d said Jay Puidokas during the comment period. \u201cAnd it was extremely eye-opening to see the values align.\u201d \nL64: \nL65: State law requires each school district to host a local forum about the new social studies standards. Garfield chose to create a 59-person committee to review how well three sets of standards \u2014 the adopted state social studies standards, revised state standards, and the American Birthright standards \u2014 aligned with several Colorado laws and how well the standards aligned to community values.\nL66: \nL67: \u201cOur entire goal has been to work collaboratively with the school board and with our community to understand what the community values are,\u201d said Jacob Pringle, secondary school curriculum director.\nL68: \nL69: [Image 4]Garfield County School District Garfield County School District RE-2 board president Tony May at a meeting over the district's social studies standards.\nL70: \nL71: In the end, 83 percent of the committee members decided that the state-adopted standards best aligned with law and the community\u2019s core values.\nL72: \nL73: \u201cYou have brought us together Director May, by inciting this outlandish political conversation. People from across the spectrum are now united in our community,\u201d Angela Strode of Rifle told the board. \nL74: \nL75: She said the board needs to move on to other issues such as a school staff shortage. \nL76: \nL77: \u201cWe need to harness the energy behind me to start fixing the problems in our schools.\u201d\nL78: \nL79: After hours of testimony, the board majority voted to move forward on the social studies standards.\nL80: \nL81: ### The issue roiled the community for months\nL82: \nL83: Last year the state board of education passed \u301019\u2020new social studies standards\u3011 to align with several state laws. The most controversial called for social studies standards to reflect the history, cultures and social contributions of diverse peoples. The law names specific groups: African American, Latino, American Indian, Asian Americans, and LGBTQ people. \nL84: \nL85: Some Garfield board members pushed back on the state\u2019s adopted standards. \nL86: \nL87: But the community, alarmed that the option could be the American Birthright standards, began to rally. Several parents said they were afraid the district was going down the same path as the Woodland Park school district, where a conservative board adopted Birthright standards and instituted several dramatic changes, including the elimination of many mental health counselors and social worker positions. An estimated forty percent of school staff left Woodland Park last year.\nL88: \nL89: \u201cWe don\u2019t want our community to be torn apart like Woodland Park, where vocal ideologues took over the school board, causing chaos where there used to be peace,\u201d Willow Brotzman, a parent with two students in the RE-2 District, said in a press release issued Thursday after the vote. \nL90: \nL91: District leaders in Garfield led an exhaustive community review process that involved public surveys, community and staff meetings as well as a social studies curriculum committee to identify the core values the community wanted to see embedded in the social studies standards, such as students becoming independent problem solvers and being a critical thinker.\nL92: \nL93: Still, despite many in the community backing state standards, curriculum leaders said there is wariness among some in the community around LGBTQ topics in school. \nL94: \nL95: \u201cIf a 4th grade student asks what LGBTQ is,\u201d asked board member Jason Shoup, \u201cis that instructor obligated to get that in-depth? Or in the (district) training (for state adopted standards), does it give avenues of an out?\u201d\nL96: \nL97: Simone Richardson, elementary curriculum director, gave an example of how such an issue might arise according to state-adopted standards: a teacher is reading a book about mom and dad taking their children to the zoo. If a child raises his hand and says, \u201cI have two dads who took me to the zoo!\u201d the teacher acknowledges the child and moves on, she said.\nL98: \nL99: \u201cMuch of training would be around how does a family carry out those conversations and not an educator,\u201d said Richardson, meaning teachers could encourage students with more questions to ask their parents.\nL100: \nL101: Pringle, the secondary school curriculum director, said training for teachers prior to the implementation of new standards would consist of age-appropriate responses. \nL102: \nL103: District officials will now make sure the curriculum aligns to the state-adopted standards.

                            "Tony May, the president of the Garfield RE-2 School Board, has been involved in discussions and decisions regarding the adoption of educational standards and mental health policies within the district. Regarding the American Birthright social studies standards, it was reported that there was an expectation that the Garfield County School District RE-2 board would adopt these standards. However, the board, led by Tony May, unexpectedly voted to adopt the state social studies standards instead, following a local committee's recommendation. This decision was made amidst community concerns about the American Birthright standards, which some considered to be politically and religiously charged\u301029\u2020source\u3011.\n\nIn terms of mental health policies, Tony May proposed that the Garfield RE-2 district openly oppose a new bill (House Bill 23-1003), which sought yearly mental evaluations for Colorado students from sixth grade through high school. May described this bill as a \"governmental overreach\" and framed his opposition as a matter of preserving parental rights. This bill would have allowed school districts to opt in for voluntary mental evaluations administered by the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment. The proposal to oppose the bill prompted discussions within the school board about the district's current tools for addressing student mental health issues. Despite May's proposal, the board decided to further address the bill in a future workshop, including insights from the district's mental health professionals, and to align their mental health policies with state law\u301036\u2020source\u3011\u301037\u2020source\u3011.\n\nThere is no direct evidence in these sources to suggest that Tony May's actions are part of a strategy to create a market for the American Birthright standards by diminishing public education. However, it is evident that his stances on educational and mental health policies have sparked debate and concern within the Garfield RE-2 community."

However, Board President Tony May pulled the discussion item from the agenda after learning a local committee was going to recommend the board instead adopt the state social studies standards. Pulling the item from the agenda enraged community members who packed the boardroom Wednesday night. \n\nTwenty-nine speakers spoke in support \u2014 two did not \u2014 of the state-adopted standards. One called the Birthright standards \u201creligiously and politically charged,\u201d and many spoke of their fatigue over political battles at school board meetings.\n\n\u201cOver the last year I\u2019ve watched the priorities change from doing whatever it takes to help every child to fighting meaningless culture wars and pushing radical agendas that do not benefit or even reflect the interests and needs of the community,\u201d said Celeste Kratzer, who grew up in Rifle and now teaches at Rifle Middle School.",

Conducted by researchers from the Colorado School of Public Health and University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, it uses data gathered from districts to better support the well-being of students.\n\nInstead, threat and suicidal risk assessments are really the only tools Garfield Re-2 has to intervene on student mental health issues, Grumley confirmed.\n\n\u201cIf we believe that there is a child at risk and it\u2019s a safety issue, then we are absolutely within our purview to utilize that tool,\u201d she said.\n\nThough a formal vote on opposition to HB 23-1003 was slated as an action item on last week\u2019s school board agenda, the board decided it would instead further address the bill through a future workshop, which will include insight from the district\u2019s mental health professionals. The district is also currently revising its policies on mental health to align with state law, the district said. ",

It will be a rambling on my part, but you will organize and bullet point them appropriately. Here are the options. Everyone, admin in this room, you have the opportunity to choose from any one of these options. Until I hear back, the first one is going to go into place the moment I step out of this room. That is, under all of these, I will go back to my room, finish out the year, and then move on. The other option is, I go back to my room, and you plan on when you are going to give me a week of professional development time at the school to use that IC Fit. Because you don't give me enough time in the classroom. And as a service, it will be payment to me for the expertise and analysis I'm going to give you about this schedule and the problems. If you don't want to do that, then you will... Make me an admin. By next year. You can take teachers off the street and make them teachers and then grade them on their performance as if you give them all of the resources they need and then ignore the fact that you are pulling all of the other teachers down. And then ignore the fact that you are pulling all of the other teachers down by lowering the standards for teaching, even though the expectations for teaching are the same. So, you will make me an admin by training me. Because as I look around this room, there is no domain of expertise that anybody in here has that I don't have besides the fact that you know how to pull the levers of the current system. I can fucking learn that over a summer. And I will. That way, I'll have the salary to do this kind of thing. And I will be expected to perform. I will give results. I will use my position to help fix these problems so I don't have to have them be lost in translation. I can just get to work on them. In addition to my other duties. But at least I won't have to come home and worry about living. Surviving. Or, somehow, today, we walk out of here and specials has at least the same exact blocks of time as the other classes. That is the same number of classes and the same blocks to prepare for those classes. Even though we still have four times the number of students. We still have that unfair advantage. At least. So, there are four things. One, I walk out and continue. And then leave. Two, I walk out and continue and become an admin. Three, I walk out and all the changes are made. And I forget what the fourth one is. Maybe you can figure it out. And on top of that, I will be graded highly effective no matter what. Even if, because you don't give me enough time, my class is a study hall."

It's a fucking different thing. I mean, you can't... Like, you can have a set of skills or tools that you can apply to both sixth and eighth grade, but by no means...

And then, in the same breath, we say, teaching sixth grade is the same, basically, as teaching eighth grade. That example I gave you about circulatory system and heart muscles that you can expect between each human being but you cannot, by any stretch of the imagination, think that dealing with each of those human beings will be a similar experience. Especially if they're from different areas of the world, and different ages, and different cultures. Like, my fucking god, we are talking about human fucking beings here. Not fucking neatly wrapped boxes with this property, and this quality, and this is what this kind of human looks like. Forget the shit that somebody taught you in college that they're teaching you. Because they were taught by somebody in college that taught them. It's like these bad ideas get passed down. Teaching sixth grade is nothing like teaching eighth grade. That's it. How do I know? Because I teach the same kids year after year. And I know, both from a physical standpoint, a behavioral standpoint, and a physiological standpoint, they're as different human beings as I am from another human being. It's a spectrum. I'm just talking about age, grade level, on average. Very different. If you were to average out everything for eighth graders, the same set of sixth graders, you would have different fucking people. And different people within the same group. You have to fucking relearn these kids every fucking year. And you never quite get to learn them once."

                            "- You highlight the contradiction in educational approaches: on one hand, there's an emphasis on catering to each student's unique needs, strengths, weaknesses, and preferences. On the other hand, there's a generalized assumption that teaching one grade level, like sixth, is essentially the same as teaching another, like eighth grade.\n\n- The analogy of the human circulatory system is used to illustrate that while certain physical aspects may be consistent across individuals, the experience of interacting with them varies greatly. This variation is amplified by differences in age, culture, and geographical background.\n\n- You emphasize the complexity of dealing with human beings, cautioning against oversimplified and rigid categorizations. You argue against the perpetuation of outdated educational concepts that fail to acknowledge the individuality of students.\n\n- Drawing from your experience of teaching the same kids year after year, you observe significant differences in students from a physical, behavioral, and physiological standpoint as they progress from sixth to eighth grade. This observation underscores the notion that students, even within the same age group, are vastly different and cannot be understood through a one-size-fits-all approach.\n\n- You stress the ongoing challenge and necessity of relearning and understanding students every year, acknowledging the difficulty in fully grasping their individuality even after prolonged interaction. This underlines the complexity and dynamic nature of teaching and the importance of recognizing and adapting to the diverse and evolving needs of students."

Or is that a symptom of being in the weeds all the time and overloaded with 120 different students in and out every day? And then again. And then at the end of four weeks, sorry, the end of eight weeks, there's 120 new students. Then at the end of eight weeks, 120 new students. Can that cause you distortions in time and not knowing when the last time... the last thing you talked about is? I don't know. Now, for you ChatGPT, based on what I just said, is not remembering who said what and names exactly and faces and conversations that I had yesterday, or remembering to continue them.

Managing a large number of students (120 in your case), each with their own unique interactions and needs, can be highly demanding and may lead to memory challenges or time distortions.\n\n1. **Cognitive Overload:** When the brain is inundated with information, especially in a high-stress, fast-paced environment like teaching multiple classes, it can struggle to process and store all the details effectively. This can result in forgetting or mixing up details like conversations or faces.\n\n2. **Context Switching:** Frequently switching between different classes and groups of students requires constant readjustment. Each switch can interrupt the thought process and make it harder to remember specific interactions.\n\n3. **Mental Fatigue:** Continuous engagement with a large volume of students and educational tasks can lead to mental fatigue, which affects memory and the ability to recall specific details or follow up on previous conversations.\n\nThese challenges are not uncommon in teaching environments, especially those with high student-to-teacher ratios. They are more indicative of the demands of the job and the need for effective strategies to manage workload and information, rather than a personal failing or unusual symptom. It might be beneficial to explore methods for organizing and tracking interactions, such as note-taking or other memory aids, to help manage the cognitive load."

In order to prevent the spread of COVID-19 by reducing the density in the classroom, the Japanese government has decided to reduce the upper-limit of class size in primary schools after 2021, which is expected to result in lowering the student-teacher ratio. The aim of this study was to examine the association between student-teacher ratio, teacher work hours and teacher stress.\nL62: \nL63: ### Methods \nL64: \nL65: Data on student-teacher ratio, teacher work hours, and teacher stress were obtained from a large-scale international survey conducted by OECD. The number of teachers participated in the survey was 3308 (primary school) and 3555 (lower-secondary school). After excluding teachers with missing observations, the analytic sample consisted of 2761 (primary school) and 3006 (lower-secondary school) teachers. Multivariate regression analysis was performed.\nL66: \nL67: ### Results \nL68: \nL69: Regression results revealed that student-teacher ratio was positively correlated with total work hours and workload stress of teachers. In particular, teachers working in schools with high student-teacher ratio spent more time on time-consuming tasks such as marking/correcting student work and communication with parents or guardians. The coefficient estimates suggested that, on average, lowering the student-teacher ratio by five in lower-secondary school was associated with 2.8 hours shorter working hours per week (p<0.001).\nL70: \nL71: ### Conclusion \nL72: \nL73: Our empirical results suggested that the class-size reduction policy starting in 2021 could reduce teacher stress and long work hours through the consequent decrease in student-teacher ratios.\nL74: \nL75: \u301021\u2020Peer Review reports\u3011 \nL76: \nL77: ## Background\nL78: \nL79: It is well known that school teachers in Japan work too long hours. According to the results of the OECD Teaching and Learning International Survey, an international, large-scale survey of teachers conducted in 2018 (hereafter TALIS 2018), the working hours of school teachers in Japan were the longest among the participating countries. The average weekly working hours of junior high school teachers in Japan was 56.0 hours, which was not only much higher than the average of the participating countries, 38.3 hours, but was also the only value exceeding 50 hours among them [\u301022\u20201\u3011].\nL80: \nL81: The problem of stress and resulting burnout among teachers has been reported in different countries and is considered to be an international phenomenon [\u301023\u20202\u3011\u2013\u301024\u20207\u3011]. In Japan, the percentage of school teachers taking leave due to mental illness among all teachers has increased more than fivefold from 0.11% in 1992 to 0.59% in 2018 [\u301025\u20208\u3011, \u301026\u20209\u3011]. Existing studies found significant association between occupational stress and mental health [\u301027\u202010\u3011, \u301028\u202011\u3011], long working hours and psychological distress [\u301029\u202012\u3011], poor mental health and lower job satisfaction [\u301030\u202013\u3011], and prolonged fatigue and both quantitative and qualitative workload [\u301031\u202014\u3011], among school teachers in Japan. A recent large-scale survey conducted by the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) found significant correlation between work hours of teachers and student-teacher ratios [\u301032\u202015\u3011]. In order to improve the working environment for school teachers, with the combined purpose of preventing the spread of COVID-19, the Japanese government has decided to reduce the upper-limit of class size, from 40 to 35, in primary schools after 2021.\nL82: \nL83: The class-size reduction policy is expected to result in lowering student-teacher ratio (hereafter STR) because more teachers will be newly hired and assigned to schools. This study empirically addressed the research question of whether higher STR at a school level were associated with longer working hours and higher stress of school teachers. More specifically, this paper examined the association between STR, working hours and workload stress of school teachers, by using detailed teacher-level survey data obtained from TALIS 2018. Our empirical results suggested that the class-size reduction policy starting in 2021 could reduce teacher stress and long work hours through the consequent decrease in STR.\nL84: \nL85: ## Literature review\nL86: \nL87: ### Student-teacher ratio \nL88: \nL89: Research on STR has a long history. An early representative example is The Tennessee Student/Teacher Achievement Ratio Study (STAR) Project and the group of subsequent studies using its survey data [\u301033\u202016\u3011\u2013\u301034\u202019\u3011]. In addition, in the field of educational economics, there is a growing body of research on the effect of class-size reduction using quasi-experimental survey designs [\u301035\u202020\u3011\u2013\u301036\u202023\u3011]. Most of these studies, however, aimed to examine the relationship between class size and student achievement, but not the relationship between class size and teacher stress or working hours. In addition, there is no theoretical analysis on the mechanism by which a decrease in STR reduces the working hours of teachers.\nL90: \nL91: ### Working hours and stress among teachers \nL92: \nL93: As mentioned above, the long working hours of school teachers have become a serious issue in Japan [\u301022\u20201\u3011, \u301025\u20208\u3011], but previous studies are limited. A Previous study showed a significant correlation between long working hours and psychological distress among male teachers, although the causal relationship was unclear [\u301029\u202012\u3011]. The Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) reported a positive and significant correlation between teachers\u2019 working hours and STR [\u301032\u202015\u3011].\nL94: \nL95: The history of research on teacher stress is long, and studies have been reported in many countries [\u301023\u20202\u3011, \u301037\u202025\u3011, \u301038\u202026\u3011]. In Japan, significant correlations were found between workload and depressive symptoms [\u301027\u202010\u3011], workload stress and mental health [\u301028\u202011\u3011], and both quantitative and qualitative workload and chronic fatigue [\u301031\u202014\u3011]. These studies indicated that Japanese school teachers experienced high levels of stress in the workplace, which was detrimental to their physical and mental health, but their results seemed difficult to generalize because they were based on a survey of teachers working in schools in geographically limited region or city.\nL96: \nL97: Karoshi is a Japanese term and can be translated as \u201coverwork death\u201d. Due to a national effort to reduce working hours, the number of Karoshi has been gradually decreasing from 317 in 2002 to 216 in 2019. However\nVisible: 0% - 23%",

What do you think?\" This was during my first year of teaching, and a mere four months into my career.\nL73: \nL74: Further reading: \u301010\u2020Going Down a New Teaching Path\u3011\nL75: \nL76: I had worked hard to find this second-grade position, and teaching multiple grade levels wasn't something I had even considered. But I wanted to be a team player, so I agreed. Little did I know that I would end up teaching every grade from first through eighth over the next 16 and a half years of my career. At times, all that change has been difficult and disorienting, but I have no doubt that it has made me a far better teacher.\nL77: \nL78: The career path I've followed isn't for everyone. But take it from me: teaching multiple grade levels can take your skills to the next level, too. Here's how.\nL79: \nL80: [Image 3] \nL81: \nL82: ## 1. It Puts Things in Perspective\nL83: \nL84: Teaching so many different grade levels has helped me understand the significance and impact each grade's curriculum has on the others. When teaching the lower grades, I knew exactly what I needed to do to prepare my students for the grades to come. When teaching the upper grades, I benefited from a nuanced understanding of the experiences my students had before they reached my classroom. A common teachers' truism says, \"In the lower grades, kids learn to read. Later on, they read to learn.\" Having taught kids at both steps of literacy development has helped me understand my students' academic lives much more clearly.\nL85: \nL86: ## 2. It Builds Transferable Skills\nL87: \nL88: When I \u301011\u2020made the jump to middle school\u3011 after 12 years of teaching elementary, I worried that my classroom management skills wouldn't be effective. I voiced my concerns to my principal, who told me I had nothing to worry about. \"Use your management skills from first grade,\" she said. \"Eighth-graders are just first-graders with facial hair. You need to constantly entertain them and drive them to think, just like a first-grade class.\"\nL89: \nL90: During the first week of school, I had my seventh- and eighth-graders do the same sorts of activities I would have used with a first-grade class. We did icebreakers, discussed why we should have rules, role-played unacceptable classroom behavior, and talked about the projects we would do over the next month. I had thought I would have to be much more serious, tough, and academically-rigorous than before, but my middle school students loved the fun and fast-paced action, and that set the tone for the year.\nL91: \nL92: The \u301012\u2020classroom management skills\u3011 that you develop from teaching multiple grade levels will make you an overall better practitioner. Over the course of my career, I've accumulated a comprehensive set of skills that have prepared me for any situation that might arise in the classroom.\nL93: \nL94: ## 3. It Helps You Be a Utility Player\nL95: \nL96: Teaching different grades can make you a valuable asset to a school. Although teachers who become masters of a certain grade level are important, utility players are a necessity on every team.\nL97: \nL98: If you're job searching, having taught multiple grade levels makes you a more marketable candidate. If you already have a position at a school you like, teaching a variety of grades can make you an invaluable master of the school's curriculum. And if your school's needs change, being willing to shift to a different grade improves your job security, especially if you're just starting out in your career.\nL99: \nL100: Further reading: \u301013\u2020How to Transition to a New School\u3011\nL101: \nL102: If you're looking for your first teaching job, you probably know which grade you'd like to teach. But be sure to keep an open mind. You might find that teaching a different grade level can be rewarding in ways you didn't anticipate. And if you're a seasoned veteran, being open to change can \u301014\u2020freshen up your practice\u2020www.ascd.org\u3011 and renew your passion for teaching. I've found teaching multiple grade levels to be incredibly rewarding, and I'm always excited to see what the next year will bring.\nL103: \nL104: SHARE FOLLOW\nL105: \nL106: Beyond the   \nL107: classroom\nL108: \nL109: Professional   \nL110: development\nL111: \nL112: Teaching   \nL113: moments\nL114: \nL115: Classroom   \nL116: innovation\nL117: \nL118: ### Recommended\nL119: \nL120:   *  \nL121:     * \u301015\u2020 \u3011 \nL122: \nL123: ##  \u301015\u2020How to Build Trust with Students\u3011 \nL124: \nL125: \u301015\u2020Learn more \u203a\u3011 \nL126: \nL127:     * \u301016\u2020 \u3011 \nL128: \nL129: ##  \u301016\u2020Engaging Students during the Long Winter Months\u3011 \nL130: \nL131: \u301016\u2020Learn more \u203a\u3011 \nL132: \nL133:     * \u301017\u2020 \u3011 \nL134: \nL135: ##  \u301017\u20205 REALISTIC Ways for Teachers to Get Healthier This Year\u3011 \nL136: \nL137: \u301017\u2020Learn more \u203a\u3011 \nL138: \nL139: ### Related\nL140: \nL141:   * ##### {{article.topic}}\nL142: \nL143: ##  {{article.title}}\nL144: \nL145: ##  \u301018\u2020Otis Kriegel\u3011 \nL146: \nL147: Writer, Teacher\nL148: \nL149: [Image 4: Otis Kriegel] \nL150: \nL151: Starting as an international outdoor adventure guide, Kriegel made his way the classroom afterwards and has been teaching for the past 15 years.

                            "The situation you described, involving teaching six classes a day across three different grade levels with a high student turnover each quarter, can indeed be challenging and potentially impact your mental clarity and stability. Here's a synthesis of information from various sources regarding the impact of such teaching conditions:\n\n1. **High Student-Teacher Ratio:** A study in Japan found that a high student-teacher ratio is positively correlated with increased total work hours and workload stress for teachers. Teachers in schools with higher student-teacher ratios spent more time on time-consuming tasks like marking student work and communicating with parents or guardians\u301035\u2020source\u3011. This suggests that managing a large number of students can significantly add to a teacher's workload and stress.\n\n2. **Stress and Burnout Among Teachers:** The issue of stress and resulting burnout among teachers is recognized internationally. In Japan, for instance, the percentage of school teachers taking leave due to mental illness increased significantly over a period. Studies have found associations between occupational stress and mental health issues, long working hours and psychological distress, and prolonged fatigue with both quantitative and qualitative workload among teachers\u301036\u2020source\u3011.\n\n3. **Benefits and Challenges of Teaching Multiple Grade Levels:** While teaching multiple grade levels is challenging, it can also have benefits. It provides a broader perspective on each grade's curriculum and its impact on others, helping teachers prepare students more effectively for future grades\u301066\u2020source\u3011. It also builds transferable skills, making teachers more adaptable and versatile in their teaching methods\u301067\u2020source\u3011. Additionally, teaching different grades can make a teacher a valuable utility player in a school, enhancing job security and marketability\u301068\u2020source\u3011.\n\n4. **Lack of Specific Studies on Teaching Multiple Grades:** While there is recognition of the challenges and benefits of teaching multiple grade levels, specific studies detailing the exact impact on teachers' mental health and clarity are not readily available. However, the general consensus in the field of education acknowledges the complexity and demands of such a role.\n\nIn summary, teaching multiple grade levels to a large number of students, especially with a high turnover rate and fragmented planning time, can indeed be challenging and potentially impact mental health and stability. While it offers professional growth and adaptability, it's crucial to balance these benefits with the potential for increased stress and workload."

When teaching the lower grades, I knew exactly what I needed to do to prepare my students for the grades to come. When teaching the upper grades, I benefited from a nuanced understanding of the experiences my students had before they reached my classroom.

Later on, they read to learn.\" Having taught kids at both steps of literacy development has helped me understand my students' academic lives much more clearly.",

It Builds Transferable Skills\n\nWhen I \u301011\u2020made the jump to middle school\u3011 after 12 years of teaching elementary, I worried that my classroom management skills wouldn't be effective. I voiced my concerns to my principal, who told me I had nothing to worry about. \"Use your management skills from first grade,\" she said. \"Eighth-graders are just first-graders with facial hair. You need to constantly entertain them and drive them to think, just like a first-grade class.\"\n\nDuring the first week of school, I had my seventh- and eighth-graders do the same sorts of activities I would have used with a first-grade class. We did icebreakers, discussed why we should have rules, role-played unacceptable classroom behavior, and talked about the projects we would do over the next month. I had thought I would have to be much more serious, tough, and academically-rigorous than before, but my middle school students loved the fun and fast-paced action, and that set the tone for the year.\n\nThe \u301012\u2020classroom management skills\u3011 that you develop from teaching multiple grade levels will make you an overall better practitioner.

And ask her to remember how upset you were that you actually needed to take time off about the midterm election, because you were so scared that you were seeing the patterns in Trump. And there was a time when people didn't take Trump seriously, and I'd yell and scream and blah blah blah. The guy's literally quoting from Hitler, and Mussolini. And you know where this goes. It gets normal. I promise you, this will get normal. One thing she talked about in particular, too, was the worst thing, was watching your friends, the things you couldn't talk to your friends about anymore, and knowing the people right next to you were completely deluded, and still are. Putin frees to death people, pregnant women. But all that, and then you see the same thing happening here. And you yell and scream and get laughed at.

I have some asks, and I don't need one, I need all of them. This schedule makes me feel unfinished all the time, because I am unfinished and unprepared. I have no time to develop new stuff, I'm rehashing a lot of old and different ways. It's dull. But if you're not going to give me the resources and time, then you're going to tell me to budge my grades off my back. I'm talking in here, and I want you to budge my grades, too. It stresses me out, just knowing. If I knew it was going to come in here, until my observation, I would feel better. I need time off for professional development. I don't have enough time to spend the money to develop new curriculum, to even examine new curriculum. I have to go through it. When am I going to fucking do that? I'm absolutely fucking burnt out at the end of the day. I am fucking toast. Every fucking day. And I want you to incur about a position for an advisor. You need the time to actually do that. You see one day, and it's too late, and educational institutions are suspending these people, these new people. And it's not a good system. I see the current dysfunction, the level of it, as a threat to democracy."

The \u301010\u2020evolution of public schools\u3011 in the United States began early in the 17^{th} century, with the first settlers on American soil. Today, the public school system in the U.S. is a complex one with a multi-tiered form of governance and a multitude of programs to address the varying needs of students and their families. Understanding the definition, purpose and operation of public schools in the U.S. helps one get a broad picture of what public education in this country looks like.\nL25: \nL26: Definition of Public Education\nL27: \nL28: \u301011\u2020Wikipedia\u2020en.wikipedia.org\u3011 defines public schools as primary or secondary schools that are available to everyone within a country\u2019s population. The schools are regulated and funded through government authority, and attendance is mandated by that government authority. Funding typically comes from taxation of the country\u2019s citizens, and the money is generally allocated through the government entity designated to oversee the public school system.\nL29: \nL30: This video offers a brief explanation of the American public school system.\nL31: \nL32: In the United States, there is a three-tiered form of governance that oversees public education, which includes federal, state and local levels. At the federal level, the Department of Education, currently overseen by \u301012\u2020Education Secretary Arne Duncan\u3011, is the entity that established policies and laws involving education in the U.S. State education agencies also play a role in governing the public schools in their states, while individual school districts, run by elected \u301013\u2020school boards\u3011 in most cases, offer their own form of oversight as well.\nL33: \nL34: Facts and Figures \nL35: \nL36: According to \u301014\u2020How Stuff Works\u2020people.howstuffworks.com\u3011, there are approximately 15,000 school districts currently operating in the United States. Because the majority of public school governance is handled at the local level, school districts can vary widely in terms of the curricula they use and the policies they follow. In most districts, students are assigned to a school based on location, with districts zoned to determine student populations for each school based on neighborhoods and addresses.\nL37: \nL38: However, as school choice evolves throughout the U.S., alternative schools like \u301015\u2020charter\u3011 and \u301016\u2020magnet schools\u3011 are allowing parents to send their children to schools outside their immediate neighborhood. Open enrollment policies in many school districts also allow parents to choose the best public school for their children\u2019s specific learning needs.\nL39: \nL40: How Stuff Works states that during the 2007-2008 school year, approximately 49.6 million students were taught by around 3.2 million teachers in primary and secondary schools nationwide. \u301016\u2020School funding\u3011 for that school year averaged just over $9,600 per student, with wide variations in that number between states and school districts. Because much of the revenue for public schools comes from property taxes, the location of the school determines how much money schools receive. Additional funding comes through state and federal resources.\nL41: \nL42: Purpose of Public Education \nL43: \nL44: The purpose of public education is one that is highly debated in education circles today. Originally, public schools were created as a part of the democracy experiment, of which the United States is still the greatest example today. In order to ensure that all members of the democracy were able to contribute to the system, education must be a part of the equation. The Core Knowledge website explains that citizens must have the \u201cknowledge and skills\u201d necessary to become active, productive members of the democratic society. This means that every member of the society must have access to the same quality of education \u2013 and a public school system is born.\nL45: \nL46: This video explains how the American public education system works.\nL47: \nL48: Access to a free education must be available to everyone. The \u301017\u2020U.S. Department of Education\u2020www2.ed.gov\u3011 website includes qualified \u301018\u2020persons with disabilities\u3011 in this mix. In fact, federal law requires that students with both physical and mental impairments receive an appropriate education, according to their specific needs. The same can be said for students of all races, gender, and income level. No student should be restricted from getting a public education that can help them become a successful and productive adult in the future.\nL49: \nL50: How Today\u2019s Public Schools Operate\nL51: \nL52: \u301019\u2020PBS\u2020www.pbs.org\u3011 states that public schools today operate under larger education systems, which are comprised of the three-tier form of governance explained previously. Teachers in the education system are now highly trained individuals with college degrees and practical experience. The pool of public school teachers has become much more diverse, as the world of education has diversified overall.\nL53: \nL54: Students in public schools today are separated according to grade, and in some cases, according to ability level. Schools are typically divided into three distinct types: elementary schools that handle grades K-6, middle schools or junior high schools with grades 7 and 8, and high schools that include grades 9-12. However, this structure can vary slightly from district to district. Some will have middle schools that include grades 6 through 8, while others have junior highs that handle 7-9. Charter schools are introducing a new school structure that includes grades K-8, with middle school students in a separate area of the building from primary students.\nL55: \nL56: This video explains the American public school system.\nL57: \nL58: Public schools today face numerous challenges in their daily operations, from \u301020\u2020crime in school\u3011 to decisions on \u301021\u2020school choice\u3011 and \u301022\u2020standardized testing\u3011. While educators may not agree on the various elements that go into creating successful public schools, they all share a common belief in the importance of a robust public education system. As the needs of students, communities and the workforce continue to evolve, we can rest assured changes to our public school system will continue to reflect those evolutions, as educators strive to meet the needs of the upcoming generations.\nL59: \nL60: Questions?

Learn about the 10 biggest problems with public schools today, both from the perspective of the administrators and the teachers\nL23: \nL24: Few would argue that the state of our education system has plenty of room for improvement. However, developing a plan to take schools in the right direction is easier said than done. The first challenge lies in identifying underlying problems keeping students from learning today. This challenge, in part, is due to the fact that the problems may change considerably depending on who is labeling them, whether it is students, parents, educators or lawmakers. Consider this list of 10 major challenges currently facing public schools, based on the perspective of many involved in the world of education today.\nL25: \nL26: Classroom Size \nL27: \nL28: Many areas of the country are facing classrooms that are literally busting out at the seams. A report at \u301011\u2020NEA Today\u2020arteurope11.wordpress.com\u3011 two years ago discussed how schools in Georgia, in the midst of major funding cuts for schools, had no choice but to lift all \u301012\u2020class size limits\u3011 to accommodate students with the faculty the school system could still afford to keep. More recently, \u301013\u2020Fairfax County in Virginia\u2020www.washingtonpost.com\u3011 has been looking into a proposal to increase classroom sizes in the face of significant budget cuts. The Board of Education in \u301014\u2020South Carolina\u2020charlestoncitypaper.com\u3011 is also weighing their options in this area.\nL29: \nL30: When money gets tight, classroom numbers are often impacted. Yet, most teachers agree that they cannot effectively teach every student in a classroom, if the class size exceeds about 30. Their statements are backed up by research. \u301015\u2020Class Size Matters\u2020www.classsizematters.org\u3011 cites a study performed by the Tennessee Star that found classes of 15-17 students in grades K-3 provided both long and short-term benefits to both the students and the teachers in those classrooms. Minority students, those living in poverty and male students appeared to benefit from smaller classroom sizes the most.\nL31: \nL32: Poverty \nL33: \nL34: Technorati reported last fall that 22 percent of the children in the U.S. live at or below poverty level. American Graduate defines poverty as a family of four with an annual income level of $23,050 or lower. American Graduate also cites a report from the Southern Education Foundation, which shows in 17 states across the U.S., low-income students now comprise the majority of public school students in those states. Some estimates put poverty levels for public school students at 25% in the not-so-distant future.\nL35: \nL36: \u301016\u2020Students living at or below poverty level\u3011 tend to have the highest dropout rates. Studies show that students who do not get enough food or sleep are less likely to perform at their full academic potential. Schools know these truths first-hand, and despite efforts to provide students with basic essentials, teachers, administrators and lawmakers know there is simply not enough to go around.\nL37: \nL38: Family Factors \nL39: \nL40: Family factors also play a role in a teacher\u2019s ability to teach students. Principals and teachers agree that what is going on at home will impact a student\u2019s propensity to learn. \u301017\u2020Divorce\u3011, single parents, poverty, violence and many other issues are all challenges a student brings to school every day. While some teachers and administrators try to work with children in less than ideal family environments, they can only do so much \u2013 especially when parents are often not willing to partner with the schools to provide for the children. \nL41: \nL42: Technology \nL43: \nL44: Kids Health Guide reports that students are more technologically advanced than many teachers today, putting instructors at a decided disadvantage in the classroom. However, a student\u2019s love of technology also tends to distract him from his schoolwork, according to NEA Today. When teachers don\u2019t have the techno-savvy to compete with those devices, by \u301018\u2020bringing education and technology together\u3011, it can be difficult to keep students\u2019 interest and attention to properly teach new concepts.\nL45: \nL46: Technology needs to come into the classroom to keep up with the learning demands of the 21^{st} century. Schools that are already cash-strapped may find an unsurmountable challenge in coming up with the funding to bring computers and other forms of technology into their classes. \u301019\u2020Scholastic\u2020www.scholastic.com\u3011 offers some tips for school districts that want to fit the bill for technology, including everything from asking individuals in the district for \u201cbig gifts\u201d to going to Uncle Sam for the funding. The website also suggests negotiating prices on technology when possible and allowing student to bring their own from home.\nL47: \nL48: [Image 2: By Intel Free Press [CC-BY-SA-2.0 (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0)], via Wikimedia Commons] \u301020\u2020Photo\u2020commons.wikimedia.org\u3011 By Intel Free Press \u301021\u2020CC-BY-SA-2.0\u2020creativecommons.org\u3011, via Wikimedia Commons \nL49: \nL50: Bullying\nL51: \nL52: \u301022\u2020Bullying\u3011 is not a new problem, but it is one that has a profound impact on the learning aptitude of many students today. Technology has given bullies even more avenues to torment their victims \u2013 through social networking, texting and other virtual interactions. \u301023\u2020Cyberbullying\u3011 has become a major issue for schools, as evidenced by the \u301024\u2020number of suicides that can be directly traced to bullying events\u3011. The fact that laws are still fuzzy regarding cyberbullying adds to the challenge \u2013 since parents, teachers and administrators are unsure of how to legally handle such issues.\nL53: \nL54: Student Attitudes and Behaviors \nL55: \nL56: Many public school teachers also cite student attitudes, such as apathy and disrespect for teachers, as a major problem facing schools today. A poll from the \u301025\u2020National Center for Education Statistics\u2020nces.ed.gov\u3011 cited that problems like apathy, tardiness, disrespect and absenteeism posed significant challenges for teachers. These issues were seen more frequently at the secondary school level, rather than the primary grades.\nL57: \nL58: No Child Left Behind \nL59: \nL60: Many students, parents and teachers see \u301026\u2020No Child Left Behind\u3011 as a detriment to the public education environment today. Although the current Obama Administration is working to reform NCLB policies, the focus in education on both the national and state level continues to be on the testing process. Student test scores are now being used by a number of states as a way to evaluate teacher performance, putting even more pressure on faculty in schools to \u201cteach to the tests.\u201d\nL61: \nL62: NEA Today quotes Kansas special educator Shelly Dunham as saying, \u201cTesting, testing, testing, what is the point of testing? Do we use the data to remediate those who do not measure up? No!\u201d Many teachers believe they are forced to teach to the annual standardized tests, and activities like recess and lunch have been cut way down to make more time for academics in light of the new testing procedures. \nL63: \nL64: Parent Involvement \nL65: \nL66: Often teachers find there is no happy medium when it comes to \u301027\u2020parental involvement\u3011, according to the Kids Health Guide. Some parents won\u2019t be seen for the entire school year, no matter what sort of issues might arise. Others never seem to go away, hovering over the child and teacher and interfering with the education process. There are ways parents can become involved and support their child\u2019s education at the same time, but teachers don\u2019t always get that level from parents.\nL67: \nL68: Student Health\nL69: \nL70: \u301028\u2020Obesity\u3011 has reached epidemic proportions in the U.S., and the same poor eating habits that led to the obesity problem may also be contributing to lower student achievement. Obesity also increases a student\u2019s risk for other conditions, like diabetes and high blood pressure, which could result in higher absenteeism and more academic issues.\nL71: \nL72: [Image 3] \u301029\u2020Photo\u2020commons.wikimedia.org\u3011 By English: Lance Cpl.

Learn about the 10 biggest problems with public schools today, both from the perspective of the administrators and the teachers\nL23: \nL24: Few would argue that the state of our education system has plenty of room for improvement. However, developing a plan to take schools in the right direction is easier said than done. The first challenge lies in identifying underlying problems keeping students from learning today. This challenge, in part, is due to the fact that the problems may change considerably depending on who is labeling them, whether it is students, parents, educators or lawmakers. Consider this list of 10 major challenges currently facing public schools, based on the perspective of many involved in the world of education today.\nL25: \nL26: Classroom Size \nL27: \nL28: Many areas of the country are facing classrooms that are literally busting out at the seams. A report at NEA Today two years ago discussed how schools in Georgia, in the midst of major funding cuts for schools, had no choice but to lift all class size limits to accommodate students with the faculty the school system could still afford to keep. More recently, Fairfax County in Virginia has been looking into a proposal to increase classroom sizes in the face of significant budget cuts. The Board of Education in South Carolina is also weighing their options in this area.\nL29: \nL30: When money gets tight, classroom numbers are often impacted. Yet, most teachers agree that they cannot effectively teach every student in a classroom, if the class size exceeds about 30. Their statements are backed up by research. Class Size Matters cites a study performed by the Tennessee Star that found classes of 15-17 students in grades K-3 provided both long and short-term benefits to both the students and the teachers in those classrooms. Minority students, those living in poverty and male students appeared to benefit from smaller classroom sizes the most.\nL31: \nL32: Poverty \nL33: \nL34: Technorati reported last fall that 22 percent of the children in the U.S. live at or below poverty level. American Graduate defines poverty as a family of four with an annual income level of $23,050 or lower. American Graduate also cites a report from the Southern Education Foundation, which shows in 17 states across the U.S., low-income students now comprise the majority of public school students in those states. Some estimates put poverty levels for public school students at 25% in the not-so-distant future.\nL35: \nL36: Students living at or below poverty level tend to have the highest dropout rates. Studies show that students who do not get enough food or sleep are less likely to perform at their full academic potential. Schools know these truths first-hand, and despite efforts to provide students with basic essentials, teachers, administrators and lawmakers know there is simply not enough to go around.\nL37: \nL38: Family Factors \nL39: \nL40: Family factors also play a role in a teacher\u2019s ability to teach students. Principals and teachers agree that what is going on at home will impact a student\u2019s propensity to learn. Divorce, single parents, poverty, violence and many other issues are all challenges a student brings to school every day. While some teachers and administrators try to work with children in less than ideal family environments, they can only do so much \u2013 especially when parents are often not willing to partner with the schools to provide for the children. \nL41: \nL42: Technology \nL43: \nL44: Kids Health Guide reports that students are more technologically advanced than many teachers today, putting instructors at a decided disadvantage in the classroom. However, a student\u2019s love of technology also tends to distract him from his schoolwork, according to NEA Today. When teachers don\u2019t have the techno-savvy to compete with those devices, by bringing education and technology together, it can be difficult to keep students\u2019 interest and attention to properly teach new concepts.\nL45: \nL46: Technology needs to come into the classroom to keep up with the learning demands of the 21^{st} century. Schools that are already cash-strapped may find an unsurmountable challenge in coming up with the funding to bring computers and other forms of technology into their classes. Scholastic offers some tips for school districts that want to fit the bill for technology, including everything from asking individuals in the district for \u201cbig gifts\u201d to going to Uncle Sam for the funding. The website also suggests negotiating prices on technology when possible and allowing student to bring their own from home.\nL47: \nL48: [Image 2: By Intel Free Press [CC-BY-SA-2.0 (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0)], via Wikimedia Commons] Photo By Intel Free Press CC-BY-SA-2.0, via Wikimedia Commons \nL49: \nL50: Bullying\nL51: \nL52: Bullying is not a new problem, but it is one that has a profound impact on the learning aptitude of many students today. Technology has given bullies even more avenues to torment their victims \u2013 through social networking, texting and other virtual interactions. Cyberbullying has become a major issue for schools, as evidenced by the number of suicides that can be directly traced to bullying events. The fact that laws are still fuzzy regarding cyberbullying adds to the challenge \u2013 since parents, teachers and administrators are unsure of how to legally handle such issues.\nL53: \nL54: Student Attitudes and Behaviors \nL55: \nL56: Many public school teachers also cite student attitudes, such as apathy and disrespect for teachers, as a major problem facing schools today. A poll from the National Center for Education Statistics cited that problems like apathy, tardiness, disrespect and absenteeism posed significant challenges for teachers. These issues were seen more frequently at the secondary school level, rather than the primary grades.\nL57: \nL58: No Child Left Behind \nL59: \nL60: Many students, parents and teachers see No Child Left Behind as a detriment to the public education environment today. Although the current Obama Administration is working to reform NCLB policies, the focus in education on both the national and state level continues to be on the testing process. Student test scores are now being used by a number of states as a way to evaluate teacher performance, putting even more pressure on faculty in schools to \u201cteach to the tests.\u201d\nL61: \nL62: NEA Today quotes Kansas special educator Shelly Dunham as saying, \u201cTesting, testing, testing, what is the point of testing? Do we use the data to remediate those who do not measure up? No!\u201d Many teachers believe they are forced to teach to the annual standardized tests, and activities like recess and lunch have been cut way down to make more time for academics in light of the new testing procedures. \nL63: \nL64: Parent Involvement \nL65: \nL66: Often teachers find there is no happy medium when it comes to parental involvement, according to the Kids Health Guide. Some parents won\u2019t be seen for the entire school year, no matter what sort of issues might arise. Others never seem to go away, hovering over the child and teacher and interfering with the education process. There are ways parents can become involved and support their child\u2019s education at the same time, but teachers don\u2019t always get that level from parents.\nL67: \nL68: Student Health\nL69: \nL70: Obesity has reached epidemic proportions in the U.S., and the same poor eating habits that led to the obesity problem may also be contributing to lower student achievement. Obesity also increases a student\u2019s risk for other conditions, like diabetes and high blood pressure, which could result in higher absenteeism and more academic issues.\nL71: \nL72: [Image 3] Photo By English: Lance Cpl.

                            "The U.S. public school system, particularly at the school level, operates under a multi-tiered governance structure and faces various challenges. Here's an overview:\n\n### Governance Structure\n- **Federal, State, and Local Levels**: The U.S. public education system is overseen by federal, state, and local entities. The Department of Education at the federal level establishes policies and laws, while state education agencies and locally elected school boards offer additional oversight\u30109\u2020source\u3011.\n- **School Districts**: There are about 15,000 school districts in the U.S., and governance is primarily local, leading to significant variation in curricula and policies. Schools typically assign students based on geographic zones\u301010\u2020source\u3011.\n- **Funding**: Public school funding, averaging around $9,600 per student as of the 2007-2008 school year, varies widely and largely depends on local property taxes. Additional resources come from state and federal levels\u301011\u2020source\u3011.\n\n### Educational Philosophy\n- The public school system is rooted in the democratic experiment of the U.S., aiming to ensure all citizens have the necessary knowledge and skills to contribute to society. This ideal underpins the goal of equal education access for all, including those with disabilities and of all races and income levels\u301012\u2020source\u3011\u301013\u2020source\u3011.\n\n### School Structure\n- **Grades and Divisions**: Schools are typically divided into elementary (grades K-6), middle/junior high (grades 7-8), and high schools (grades 9-12), although this can vary. Some districts include grades 6-8 in middle schools, while others have junior highs covering grades 7-9. Charter schools often have K-8 structures\u301014\u2020source\u3011.\n\n### Challenges Faced by Public Schools\n1. **Classroom Size**: Overcrowding is a common issue, with budget constraints often forcing schools to increase class sizes, which can negatively impact teaching effectiveness\u301021\u2020source\u3011.\n2. **Poverty**: A significant percentage of students live at or below the poverty level, affecting dropout rates and academic performance due to factors like inadequate nutrition and sleep\u301022\u2020source\u3011.\n3. **Family Factors**: Home environments, including divorce, single parenting, and poverty, significantly influence a student's ability to learn\u301023\u2020source\u3011.\n4. **Technology**: The gap between students' and teachers' technological skills, and the lack of resources for tech integration, pose challenges\u301024\u2020source\u3011.\n5. **Bullying and Cyberbullying**: Bullying, exacerbated by technology, impacts student learning and well-being, with legal ambiguities complicating response strategies\u301025\u2020source\u3011.\n6. **Student Attitudes and Behaviors**: Issues like apathy, disrespect, tardiness, and absenteeism, especially at the secondary level, challenge teachers\u301026\u2020source\u3011.\n7. **Testing Focus**: Policies like \"No Child Left Behind\" have shifted focus to standardized testing, pressuring teachers to \"teach to the test\" and impacting curriculum breadth\u301027\u2020source\u3011.\n8. **Parental Involvement**: Varying levels of parental involvement, either too little or excessive, can affect the educational process\u301028\u2020source\u3011.\n9. **Student Health**: Health issues like obesity, which affect a significant portion of students, can lead to increased absenteeism and lower academic achievement\u301029\u2020source\u3011.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe U.S. public school system is a complex and dynamic entity, aiming to provide equal educational opportunities to all students while facing a myriad of challenges that evolve with societal changes."

Schools are typically divided into three distinct types: elementary schools that handle grades K-6, middle schools or junior high schools with grades 7 and 8, and high schools that include grades 9-12. However, this structure can vary slightly from district to district. Some will have middle schools that include grades 6 through 8, while others have junior highs that handle 7-9. Charter schools are introducing a new school structure that includes grades K-8, with middle school students in a separate area of the building from primary students.",

More recently, \u301013\u2020Fairfax County in Virginia\u2020www.washingtonpost.com\u3011 has been looking into a proposal to increase classroom sizes in the face of significant budget cuts. The Board of Education in \u301014\u2020South Carolina\u2020charlestoncitypaper.com\u3011 is also weighing their options in this area.\n\nWhen money gets tight, classroom numbers are often impacted. Yet, most teachers agree that they cannot effectively teach every student in a classroom, if the class size exceeds about 30. Their statements are backed up by research. \u301015\u2020Class Size Matters\u2020www.classsizematters.org\u3011 cites a study performed by the Tennessee Star that found classes of 15-17 students in grades K-3 provided both long and short-term benefits to both the students and the teachers in those classrooms.

And when trying to implement large-scale initiatives like the Common Core State Standards that require rethinking professional learning, curriculum and instructional materials, family engagement activities, assessment and other aspects of the education system, collaboration is particularly important.\nL40: \nL41: But too often the rhetoric of change indicates that it is being done to teachers, not with them -- particularly change driven by politicians who know little about education and are more conscious of the political realities they face than the best interests of students. And as we have learned from education reforms past, that type of change is doomed to fail.\nL42: \nL43: Yet there are places across the country where that is not the case. These are places where teachers and administrators work together both to implement policy decisions in ways that benefit students and to develop innovative solutions to the challenges that their community faces. One such place: California's \u301013\u2020ABC Unified School District\u2020www.abcusd.k12.ca.us\u3011.\nL44: \nL45: ### Collaboration in ABC \nL46: \nL47: ABC has been widely praised for the collaborative relationship that exists between its teachers and administrators. Not only has the district received a great deal of positive press about this partnership (for example, one blogger \u301014\u2020recently wrote\u2020blogs.edweek.org\u3011 that he \"left ABC rejoicing in what they have been able to accomplish\" in this arena), it also served as the basis for research by Rutgers University's Saul Rubinstein and John McCarthy on \u301015\u2020how working together improves student achievement\u2020www.americanprogress.org\u3011.\nL48: \nL49: What makes ABC so special is not just the fact that a strong partnership between teachers and administrators exists. It is the fact that the collaboration has been institutionalized. The partnership has thrived for well over a decade, under multiple superintendents and through a number of school board elections. And this has led to a district culture \"of shared planning, decision-making, and responsibility\" that is \"built on respect, commitment, and trust,\" as a \u301016\u20202011 case study\u2020www.americanprogress.org\u3011 puts it.\nL50: \nL51: Among the many issues that teachers and administrators in ABC have tackled together are curriculum development, textbook selection, recruitment and hiring, mentoring, teacher evaluation and support, and use of data-based decision making to improve student performance. And the partnership is having a positive impact on students.\nL52: \nL53: One early example of collaborative problem solving in the district was the creation of the Southside Schools Reading Collaborative, which targeted resources and support to six high needs schools that then showed the most growth on standardized assessments in the district. And Rubinstein and McCarthy's research shows that the district's students have higher achievement in the schools with stronger partnerships between teachers unions and school administration.\nL54: \nL55: ### What Does It Look Like?\nL56: \nL57: Those in education use the words \"collaboration\" and \"partnership\" quite liberally, often giving little to no details on what specifically good examples look like. But a 2011 set of \u301016\u2020case studies\u2020www.americanprogress.org\u3011 of six districts, including ABC, that have developed and sustained strong relationships between teachers and their unions and administrators while improving public education found thirteen common themes, including:\nL58: \nL59:   * Emphasis on teacher quality, including professional development, new systems of evaluation, peer-to-peer assistance and mentoring programs \nL60:   * Focus on student performance, with districts creating opportunities for teachers and administrators to work together to analyze student performance to identify and focus on priority areas for improvement \nL61:   * Substantive problem-solving, innovation and willingness to experiment, working together to come up with new ways to address critical issues, with the partnership serving as a vehicle for improvement (not as the end in itself)\nL62:   * An organizational culture that values and supports collaboration, evidenced in part by leaders speaking of a culture of inclusion, involvement and communication, as well as respect for teachers as professionals and for their union \nL63:   * Collaborative structures at all levels in the district, with an infrastructure that promotes and facilitates collaborative decision-making in schools through building-level leadership teams, school improvement committees, school advisory councils or other such bodies that meet on regularly and play a key role in site-based decision making \nL64: \nL65: ### Collaboration in Action: Common Core Implementation \nL66: \nL67: When a district that has a strong collaborative culture undertakes a major initiative like implementing the Common Core, what does it look like? We at the Learning First Alliance recently interviewed two representatives of ABC to find out: \u301017\u2020Richard Saldana\u2020www.learningfirst.org\u3011 a high school teacher and department chair who also serves on the executive board of the ABC Federation of Teachers, and \u301018\u2020Tanya Golden\u2020www.learningfirst.org\u3011, a sixth grade teacher who also serves as a teacher leader. Each shared their experience with the Common Core, and what emerged reinforced the notion that collaboration plays a key role in the day-to-day operations of the district, while also illustrating the importance of teacher voice and leadership in implementation.\nL68: \nL69: What exactly does that mean?\nL70: \nL71: It means that the district has had over 144 teachers on Common Core study teams for the past two years, and that the district convened teachers to develop and review instructional units when none were available.\nL72: \nL73: Recognizing that Common Core implementation is an enormous undertaking, it means that teachers and district leaders worked together to identify three key academic focus areas for the school year: text dependent questions, writing from sources, and academic vocabulary (with each school site selecting one on which to concentrate).\nL74: \nL75: And it means that the district provides teacher leaders like Golden to support them in that effort -- teacher leaders who meet monthly with the district's academic services division for professional learning to equip them with the skills they need to help schools succeed.\nL76: \nL77: It means that teacher leaders like Saldana meet at least monthly with district leadership to discuss concerns that come forth from the teachers representative council of the union (which also meets monthly), so there's a constant flow of information between teacher and the district.\nL78: \nL79: It means that teachers and administrators go together to school board sessions and parent information meetings, speaking with one voice.\nL80: \nL81: It means that the district provides joint trainings for teachers and principals, with district officials and teacher leaders presenting information together. The goal: To send a unified message and ensure clear communication.\nL82: \nL83: ### The Key Takeaway \nL84: \nL85: The way that ABC has approached the Common Core -- and the way it approaches all issues -- seems intuitive. So why don't we hear more stories like theirs?\nL86: \nL87: As Saldana put it, \"I think the most important lesson for all of us is to find the time to collaborate. I think the biggest reason we don't collaborate is because it takes time.\"\nL88: \nL89: But as the experience of ABC shows, finding that time makes improving student learning a whole lot easier.\nL90:\nVisible: 0% - 72%",

And when trying to implement large-scale initiatives like the Common Core State Standards that require rethinking professional learning, curriculum and instructional materials, family engagement activities, assessment and other aspects of the education system, collaboration is particularly important.\nL40: \nL41: But too often the rhetoric of change indicates that it is being done to teachers, not with them -- particularly change driven by politicians who know little about education and are more conscious of the political realities they face than the best interests of students. And as we have learned from education reforms past, that type of change is doomed to fail.\nL42: \nL43: Yet there are places across the country where that is not the case. These are places where teachers and administrators work together both to implement policy decisions in ways that benefit students and to develop innovative solutions to the challenges that their community faces.

Not only has the district received a great deal of positive press about this partnership (for example, one blogger \u301014\u2020recently wrote\u2020blogs.edweek.org\u3011 that he \"left ABC rejoicing in what they have been able to accomplish\" in this arena), it also served as the basis for research by Rutgers University's Saul Rubinstein and John McCarthy on \u301015\u2020how working together improves student achievement\u2020www.americanprogress.org\u3011.\n\nWhat makes ABC so special is not just the fact that a strong partnership between teachers and administrators exists. It is the fact that the collaboration has been institutionalized. The partnership has thrived for well over a decade, under multiple superintendents and through a number of school board elections. And this has led to a district culture \"of shared planning, decision-making, and responsibility\" that is \"built on respect, commitment, and trust,\" as a \u301016\u20202011 case study\u2020www.americanprogress.org\u3011 puts it.",

Perhaps time ran out before work was completed. Or maybe the team got stuck on an agenda item, and the result was to create more work than they had before! How can schools restructure meetings so that they truly serve the team, and not the other way around?\nL72: \nL73: I wrestled with this question regularly in my first years as an elementary school principal. I required each grade-level team to meet weekly to unpack the reading and math curricula, create common assessments, analyze student data, and share instructional ideas. Thanks to our professional reading and training, our faculty was well-versed in the tenets of professional learning communities, and we all saw the value in collaboration. But even though we had strong buy-in for why we should meet and what kind of tasks we should tackle together, I couldn't say that our meetings were serving us well.\nL74: \nL75: Far too often, I observed teams completing only part of their work, running out of time, and then telling each other to finish up on their own. \"We'll circle back to this at next week's meeting,\" they'd say, but by the next week, there was a new load of lessons to plan, data to analyze, or student issues to discuss. The pace of instruction would not wait for last week's team meeting agenda.\nL76: \nL77: It occurred to our school leadership team that we could sit back and have teachers continue to go through the motions of working as collaborative-learning teams or we could reimagine the way time was used in our meetings and make that time better work for us. As Rick DuFour put it, \"We have always worked hard. Will we now choose to work smart?\" 1  After much reflection with the leadership team and discussions with grade-level team leaders, I put forth the following guiding principles to help our school reimagine our weekly team meetings:\nL78: \nL79:   1. Work should get done at the meeting.\nL80: \nL81:   2. We must manage ourselves so that work gets done.\nL82: \nL83: ## Visualizing Meeting Time \nL84: \nL85: The importance of the first point was made crystal clear to me by an activity we required of all our grade-level teams when we began the process of reimagining our meetings. Our leadership team knew that our teams were not completing tasks at meetings, but we needed the teachers' reflections to really diagnose the problem and generate incentive for change.\nL86: \nL87: At each grade-level team's next meeting, I gave each individual teacher a marker and a paper with a circle drawn on it. I asked them to turn the circle into a pie chart that represented how they spent time in a typical team meeting. But there could be only two categories on this pie chart: accomplishing work and creating more work. The teachers had to divide their charts between these two areas, according to their personal perceptions.\nL88: \nL89: After they finished their pie charts, the teachers displayed them in a central location for all to see. At each meeting, this was a powerful moment. All our teachers had the same general perception: We were making work for ourselves in meetings more frequently than we were getting work done. (One teacher's pie chart, defying the instructions, even had a third section carved out marked \"Wondering what we're doing!\")\nL90: \nL91: I then led the teams in a candid conversation about the state of our team meetings. During this group reflection, I asked, \"How do we make it so that team meetings actually make your jobs easier?\" The teachers shared their frustration about the sheer number of agenda items they typically had to address during a team meeting, including some that administrators felt were important, but that had low value for people doing the teaching. Instead, they wanted to use meeting time for more detailed instructional planning with their colleagues, who could help them make good ideas better and ensure that their pacing of lessons was consistent with the curriculum.\nL92: \nL93: The leadership team agreed to proceed in that direction. From that point on, grade-level teams set aside their previous agenda formats for the formation of agenda items oriented around lesson planning. As a school, we also acknowledged that there would be difficulties ahead as we spent more time on some priorities and less time on some other items that were once mainstays on our meeting agendas.\nL94: \nL95: ## Who's Talking?\nL96: \nL97: Deciding to refocus meeting agendas was a significant breakthrough for us, but there was more to be done. I knew that even with clearly articulated and improved meeting goals, unconstructive behaviors at team meetings could sandbag our work. One very real problem I had noticed at meetings was the tendency of some team members to dominate discussions, process information out loud too often, or go off on tangents. These behaviors, though not ill-intentioned, could easily consume an inordinate amount of meeting time.\nL98: \nL99: To address this problem, I again had all teams use another regular team meeting time to participate in a reflection activity. I once again gave each teacher a marker and a paper with a circle on it. This time, I asked them to create a pie chart that would be divided into slices according to \"Who's Talking?\" at a typical team meeting. There could be as many slices as there were members of that team, but no names were to be written on the slices.\nL100: \nL101: Once these charts were completed and displayed, we had another candid team discussion, this time about whether all voices were being heard in meetings and how teams could work more interdependently. Seeing many pie charts split into very unequal slices raised questions about whether quieter or more reserved team members were being drowned out at meetings. I steered the conversations to a discussion on how we needed active discussion at team meetings, but how unfocused talk could prevent us from accomplishing the practical goals we'd recently established.\nL102: \nL103: These discussions ultimately led to new meeting protocols for the teams, which included pausing and paraphrasing what the previous speaker said before commenting, the use of participation chips for some dialogues, and taking turns among teammates in making the first comment or question on each topic.\nL104: \nL105: ## Sticking to Agreements \nL106: \nL107: There was one more step needed to actualize our new approach to team meetings. At the beginning of each new school year, team leaders were asked to lead a discussion with their teams in which they created working agreements for their time together (for example, \"begin meetings at 9:05\"; \"resist side conversations\"; or \"put phones away\"). The purpose of the working agreements was to ensure that the meeting time was productive. Every September, once these agreements were established\nVisible: 1% - 32%",

And when trying to implement large-scale initiatives like the Common Core State Standards that require rethinking professional learning, curriculum and instructional materials, family engagement activities, assessment and other aspects of the education system, collaboration is particularly important.\nL40: \nL41: But too often the rhetoric of change indicates that it is being done to teachers, not with them -- particularly change driven by politicians who know little about education and are more conscious of the political realities they face than the best interests of students. And as we have learned from education reforms past, that type of change is doomed to fail.\nL42: \nL43: Yet there are places across the country where that is not the case. These are places where teachers and administrators work together both to implement policy decisions in ways that benefit students and to develop innovative solutions to the challenges that their community faces. One such place: California's \u301013\u2020ABC Unified School District\u2020www.abcusd.k12.ca.us\u3011.\nL44: \nL45: ### Collaboration in ABC \nL46: \nL47: ABC has been widely praised for the collaborative relationship that exists between its teachers and administrators. Not only has the district received a great deal of positive press about this partnership (for example, one blogger \u301014\u2020recently wrote\u2020blogs.edweek.org\u3011 that he \"left ABC rejoicing in what they have been able to accomplish\" in this arena), it also served as the basis for research by Rutgers University's Saul Rubinstein and John McCarthy on \u301015\u2020how working together improves student achievement\u2020www.americanprogress.org\u3011.\nL48: \nL49: What makes ABC so special is not just the fact that a strong partnership between teachers and administrators exists. It is the fact that the collaboration has been institutionalized. The partnership has thrived for well over a decade, under multiple superintendents and through a number of school board elections. And this has led to a district culture \"of shared planning, decision-making, and responsibility\" that is \"built on respect, commitment, and trust,\" as a \u301016\u20202011 case study\u2020www.americanprogress.org\u3011 puts it.\nL50: \nL51: Among the many issues that teachers and administrators in ABC have tackled together are curriculum development, textbook selection, recruitment and hiring, mentoring, teacher evaluation and support, and use of data-based decision making to improve student performance. And the partnership is having a positive impact on students.\nL52: \nL53: One early example of collaborative problem solving in the district was the creation of the Southside Schools Reading Collaborative, which targeted resources and support to six high needs schools that then showed the most growth on standardized assessments in the district. And Rubinstein and McCarthy's research shows that the district's students have higher achievement in the schools with stronger partnerships between teachers unions and school administration.\nL54: \nL55: ### What Does It Look Like?\nL56: \nL57: Those in education use the words \"collaboration\" and \"partnership\" quite liberally, often giving little to no details on what specifically good examples look like. But a 2011 set of \u301016\u2020case studies\u2020www.americanprogress.org\u3011 of six districts, including ABC, that have developed and sustained strong relationships between teachers and their unions and administrators while improving public education found thirteen common themes, including:\nL58: \nL59:   * Emphasis on teacher quality, including professional development, new systems of evaluation, peer-to-peer assistance and mentoring programs \nL60:   * Focus on student performance, with districts creating opportunities for teachers and administrators to work together to analyze student performance to identify and focus on priority areas for improvement \nL61:   * Substantive problem-solving, innovation and willingness to experiment, working together to come up with new ways to address critical issues, with the partnership serving as a vehicle for improvement (not as the end in itself)\nL62:   * An organizational culture that values and supports collaboration, evidenced in part by leaders speaking of a culture of inclusion, involvement and communication, as well as respect for teachers as professionals and for their union \nL63:   * Collaborative structures at all levels in the district, with an infrastructure that promotes and facilitates collaborative decision-making in schools through building-level leadership teams, school improvement committees, school advisory councils or other such bodies that meet on regularly and play a key role in site-based decision making \nL64: \nL65: ### Collaboration in Action: Common Core Implementation \nL66: \nL67: When a district that has a strong collaborative culture undertakes a major initiative like implementing the Common Core, what does it look like? We at the Learning First Alliance recently interviewed two representatives of ABC to find out: \u301017\u2020Richard Saldana\u2020www.learningfirst.org\u3011 a high school teacher and department chair who also serves on the executive board of the ABC Federation of Teachers, and \u301018\u2020Tanya Golden\u2020www.learningfirst.org\u3011, a sixth grade teacher who also serves as a teacher leader. Each shared their experience with the Common Core, and what emerged reinforced the notion that collaboration plays a key role in the day-to-day operations of the district, while also illustrating the importance of teacher voice and leadership in implementation.\nL68: \nL69: What exactly does that mean?\nL70: \nL71: It means that the district has had over 144 teachers on Common Core study teams for the past two years, and that the district convened teachers to develop and review instructional units when none were available.\nL72: \nL73: Recognizing that Common Core implementation is an enormous undertaking, it means that teachers and district leaders worked together to identify three key academic focus areas for the school year: text dependent questions, writing from sources, and academic vocabulary (with each school site selecting one on which to concentrate).\nL74: \nL75: And it means that the district provides teacher leaders like Golden to support them in that effort -- teacher leaders who meet monthly with the district's academic services division for professional learning to equip them with the skills they need to help schools succeed.\nL76: \nL77: It means that teacher leaders like Saldana meet at least monthly with district leadership to discuss concerns that come forth from the teachers representative council of the union (which also meets monthly), so there's a constant flow of information between teacher and the district.\nL78: \nL79: It means that teachers and administrators go together to school board sessions and parent information meetings, speaking with one voice.\nL80: \nL81: It means that the district provides joint trainings for teachers and principals, with district officials and teacher leaders presenting information together. The goal: To send a unified message and ensure clear communication.\nL82: \nL83: ### The Key Takeaway \nL84: \nL85: The way that ABC has approached the Common Core -- and the way it approaches all issues -- seems intuitive. So why don't we hear more stories like theirs?\nL86: \nL87: As Saldana put it, \"I think the most important lesson for all of us is to find the time to collaborate. I think the biggest reason we don't collaborate is because it takes time.\"\nL88: \nL89: But as the experience of ABC shows, finding that time makes improving student learning a whole lot easier.\nL90:\nVisible: 0% - 72%",

And when trying to implement large-scale initiatives like the Common Core State Standards that require rethinking professional learning, curriculum and instructional materials, family engagement activities, assessment and other aspects of the education system, collaboration is particularly important.\nL40: \nL41: But too often the rhetoric of change indicates that it is being done to teachers, not with them -- particularly change driven by politicians who know little about education and are more conscious of the political realities they face than the best interests of students. And as we have learned from education reforms past, that type of change is doomed to fail.\nL42: \nL43: Yet there are places across the country where that is not the case. These are places where teachers and administrators work together both to implement policy decisions in ways that benefit students and to develop innovative solutions to the challenges that their community faces. One such place: California's ABC Unified School District.\nL44: \nL45: ### Collaboration in ABC \nL46: \nL47: ABC has been widely praised for the collaborative relationship that exists between its teachers and administrators. Not only has the district received a great deal of positive press about this partnership (for example, one blogger recently wrote that he \"left ABC rejoicing in what they have been able to accomplish\" in this arena), it also served as the basis for research by Rutgers University's Saul Rubinstein and John McCarthy on how working together improves student achievement.\nL48: \nL49: What makes ABC so special is not just the fact that a strong partnership between teachers and administrators exists. It is the fact that the collaboration has been institutionalized. The partnership has thrived for well over a decade, under multiple superintendents and through a number of school board elections. And this has led to a district culture \"of shared planning, decision-making, and responsibility\" that is \"built on respect, commitment, and trust,\" as a 2011 case study puts it.\nL50: \nL51: Among the many issues that teachers and administrators in ABC have tackled together are curriculum development, textbook selection, recruitment and hiring, mentoring, teacher evaluation and support, and use of data-based decision making to improve student performance. And the partnership is having a positive impact on students.\nL52: \nL53: One early example of collaborative problem solving in the district was the creation of the Southside Schools Reading Collaborative, which targeted resources and support to six high needs schools that then showed the most growth on standardized assessments in the district. And Rubinstein and McCarthy's research shows that the district's students have higher achievement in the schools with stronger partnerships between teachers unions and school administration.\nL54: \nL55: ### What Does It Look Like?\nL56: \nL57: Those in education use the words \"collaboration\" and \"partnership\" quite liberally, often giving little to no details on what specifically good examples look like. But a 2011 set of case studies of six districts, including ABC, that have developed and sustained strong relationships between teachers and their unions and administrators while improving public education found thirteen common themes, including:\nL58: \nL59:   * Emphasis on teacher quality, including professional development, new systems of evaluation, peer-to-peer assistance and mentoring programs \nL60:   * Focus on student performance, with districts creating opportunities for teachers and administrators to work together to analyze student performance to identify and focus on priority areas for improvement \nL61:   * Substantive problem-solving, innovation and willingness to experiment, working together to come up with new ways to address critical issues, with the partnership serving as a vehicle for improvement (not as the end in itself)\nL62:   * An organizational culture that values and supports collaboration, evidenced in part by leaders speaking of a culture of inclusion, involvement and communication, as well as respect for teachers as professionals and for their union \nL63:   * Collaborative structures at all levels in the district, with an infrastructure that promotes and facilitates collaborative decision-making in schools through building-level leadership teams, school improvement committees, school advisory councils or other such bodies that meet on regularly and play a key role in site-based decision making \nL64: \nL65: ### Collaboration in Action: Common Core Implementation \nL66: \nL67: When a district that has a strong collaborative culture undertakes a major initiative like implementing the Common Core, what does it look like? We at the Learning First Alliance recently interviewed two representatives of ABC to find out: Richard Saldana a high school teacher and department chair who also serves on the executive board of the ABC Federation of Teachers, and Tanya Golden, a sixth grade teacher who also serves as a teacher leader. Each shared their experience with the Common Core, and what emerged reinforced the notion that collaboration plays a key role in the day-to-day operations of the district, while also illustrating the importance of teacher voice and leadership in implementation.\nL68: \nL69: What exactly does that mean?\nL70: \nL71: It means that the district has had over 144 teachers on Common Core study teams for the past two years, and that the district convened teachers to develop and review instructional units when none were available.\nL72: \nL73: Recognizing that Common Core implementation is an enormous undertaking, it means that teachers and district leaders worked together to identify three key academic focus areas for the school year: text dependent questions, writing from sources, and academic vocabulary (with each school site selecting one on which to concentrate).\nL74: \nL75: And it means that the district provides teacher leaders like Golden to support them in that effort -- teacher leaders who meet monthly with the district's academic services division for professional learning to equip them with the skills they need to help schools succeed.\nL76: \nL77: It means that teacher leaders like Saldana meet at least monthly with district leadership to discuss concerns that come forth from the teachers representative council of the union (which also meets monthly), so there's a constant flow of information between teacher and the district.\nL78: \nL79: It means that teachers and administrators go together to school board sessions and parent information meetings, speaking with one voice.\nL80: \nL81: It means that the district provides joint trainings for teachers and principals, with district officials and teacher leaders presenting information together. The goal: To send a unified message and ensure clear communication.\nL82: \nL83: ### The Key Takeaway \nL84: \nL85: The way that ABC has approached the Common Core -- and the way it approaches all issues -- seems intuitive. So why don't we hear more stories like theirs?\nL86: \nL87: As Saldana put it, \"I think the most important lesson for all of us is to find the time to collaborate. I think the biggest reason we don't collaborate is because it takes time.\"\nL88: \nL89: But as the experience of ABC shows, finding that time makes improving student learning a whole lot easier.\nL90:\nVisible: 0% - 72%",

                        "result": " classes were largely asynchronous, Spark went \u201clive,\u201d using synchronous instruction. Teachers decided together how they would teach, what a daily class should look like, and how much homework to assign. Once systems were up and running, Spark students attended three live, virtual classes each morning, where their English language arts, math, and science teachers presented lessons and convened small groups for extra help. In the afternoon, students participated in a live fitness class and one other option: music, counseling, tutoring, or an enrichment exercise.\nL88: \nL89: Similarly, at Guilmette Middle School, teams were already well-established before COVID-19. Principal Jessica Cunningham, who had been a Guilmette administrator for several years, knew she could count on teams of teachers to make online learning work. \u201cIt was really easy to figure out. \u2018How do we do staff meetings? How do we still connect on a professional level?\u2019 We just took our normal structures\u2014grade 5 and grade 6 [teachers] meet every Monday at a certain time, for instance\u2014and Zoomed them. Our verticals [subject-based team meetings] kept taking place.\u201d\nL90: \nL91: As at Spark Academy, Guilmette Middle School\u2019s teachers first learned to use the new online platforms together and then taught live classes. The school embedded support staff\u2014such as teaching assistants for English learners and special needs students\u2014in the teacher teams so that all educators who interacted with students shared the same information and expectations. Students who relied on special assistance could easily have been left behind if the entire team had not been present for both planning and instruction. \nL92: \nL93: The crisis galvanized some school teams into action. At Guilmette Elementary School, Kathleen Smith had been principal for only eight months when COVID-19 hit. Before the shutdown, she\u2019d encouraged teachers to collaborate more and create greater coherence and continuity for students. But it wasn\u2019t until schools closed unexpectedly that teachers realized that they would have to work together and decide how to proceed. \u201cIt\u2019s been so challenging to reach all of our learners,\u201d Smith reflected. \u201cPeople have had to rely on one another and become a team in way more dramatic ways than before the pandemic. That\u2019s the silver lining through all of this.\u201d\nL94: \nL95: When I asked Jessica Cunningham how she thought things would be going at her school if teams hadn\u2019t already been well organized, she responded, \u201cA mess. A complete mess.\u201d   \nL96: \nL97: ## The Price of Working in Isolation\nL98: \nL99: In fact, teachers did struggle in schools where grade-level and subject-based teams didn\u2019t exist or functioned erratically. Most teachers in such schools created and distributed work packets with weekly assignments. Sometimes, they convened their classes virtually so that students could see each other. Even then, they encountered daunting problems\u2014technological SNAFUs, missing students, and ignored \u00adassignments. Although many waited in the hope that everything would soon return to normal, their schools remained closed for over a year.\nL100: \nL101: A teacher in one such middle school told me he had always enjoyed \u201cincredible autonomy\u201d in what to teach and he seldom conferred with \u00adcolleagues about instruction or students. But when his school suddenly closed, he felt unmoored: \nL102: \nL103: > I didn\u2019t know who was in charge of anything, really. . . . I\u2019m mostly sticking with the curriculum that I had planned this spring but doing it much slower. Really, we\u2019re only doing about 25 percent of the curriculum I had planned. . . . I\u2019d say 25 percent of my kids are just kind of MIA. \nL104: \nL105: At another secondary school where teachers were left largely on their own, one told me, \nL106: \nL107: > It\u2019s been chaotic, and we\u2019ve been trying to just do the best we can. I don\u2019t think there is anything similar about any of the classes in this school right now.   \nL108: > \nL109: \nL110: ## Strengthening Collaboration\nL111: \nL112: I checked back with the school leaders this past spring, a year after my initial interview, and asked how teacher teams were working. Over the summer and fall of 2020, they had all taken steps to further strengthen collaboration. Jessica Cunningham provided training to support her teams\u2019 work. She modeled ways to facilitate a meeting; identified roles individuals might assume during meetings, like co-host, recorder, and tech supporter; and demonstrated engagement strategies teachers could use with both peers and students. So that team members could learn more about their colleagues\u2019 instruction, some volunteered to serve as \u201c\u00adresident teachers,\u201d who welcomed peers to observe their online classes.\nL113: \nL114: At Spark Academy, administrators and the school\u2019s Teacher Leadership Team (TLT) assessed their spring 2020 experience with synchronous instruction. They realized that hours of live teaching via computers had been stressful for students and teachers alike. When school started online again in September 2020, attendance lagged. So Spark introduced more varied and active learning experiences for students, including frequent opportunities to meet in small groups with their teachers for guided instruction. \nL115: \nL116: [Image 16][Image 17]\nL117: \nL118: #### Schools with well-established instructional teams pivoted quickly. Schools where teachers routinely worked on their own were overwhelmed.\nL119: \nL120: [Image 18: Author Image]\nL121: \nL122: #### \nL123: \nL124: Principal Qazilbash said that in the months that followed, Spark\u2019s teams used some of their planning time to \u201credesign for the long term.\u201d They chose a new curriculum to better support students\u2019 development in reading and writing. They also decided to shorten classes from 60 to 45 minutes for the 2021\u20132022 school year to provide more time for teachers to meet with colleagues and instructional coaches and to confer with parents. Each day, teachers will have four periods of teaching, one period of intervention with a small group of students, and three periods for planning and professional growth. (It\u2019s not yet clear exactly how instruction will happen in the district throughout the 2021\u20132022 year, but seems likely most students will be back in school full-time, with some still remote). \nL125: \nL126: Qazilbash reflected on the benefits of collaborating about schoolwide decisions: \u201cIt\u2019s helpful to have the TLT consult with other teachers and think it through with us and say \u2018Yes this is the right choice\u2019 or \u2018No, let\u2019s go in a different direction.\u2019 And it\u2019s not just for buy-in: It\u2019s helpful because often we get a better product.\u201d\nL127: \nL128: When Massachusetts began to reopen schools in April, 2021, district officials decided that all Lawrence schools would provide instruction for students attending class in person as well as those attending online from home. How they would do so was up to the schools, and again teacher teams deliberated how best to move ahead. \nL129: \nL130: At Guilmette Middle School, grade-level teams adopted different models to meet their students\u2019 strengths and needs, while at Guilmette Elementary School, teams decided whether teachers at each grade level would instruct only their own students or co-teach classes. Every decision brought unexpected challenges to consider, such as how teachers could ensure that students\u2019 \u00adcomments could be heard easily by \u00adclassmates within the classroom and at home.    \nL131: \nL132: ## Steps for Building Strong Teams\nL133: \nL134: I wasn\u2019t surprised to learn how important teacher teams were, both to these schools\u2019 rapid recovery after sudden shutdown and to their steady improvement. In earlier studies of schools that successfully educate students from low-income communities, I found each school had a robust system of grade-level and subject-based teams where teachers collaborated regularly. Effective teams engaged everyone in the school, drawing on teachers\u2019 best ideas and making them better. School culture grew stronger as teams adopted shared practices, learned from one another, and developed professional norms about \u201cthe way we do things here.\u201d\nL135: \nL136: But effective teacher teams don\u2019t emerge or flourish spontaneously. Their success depends on principals who believe that their school can respond well to any challenge when teachers\u2014who know the students best\u2014have a meaningful say in decisions. Effective teams also need teachers themselves to step up and contribute their best ideas and effort. Retreating to one\u2019s classroom is no longer an option. \nL137: \nL138: ### Leadership Takeaway\nL139: \nL140: Effective teacher teams don\u2019t emerge spontaneously. They grow steadily, with the encouragement and expertise of school leaders. \nL141: \nL142: Not all principals have the autonomy to choose the path for their school\u2019s development that school leaders in Lawrence do. But this district\u2019s experience highlights actions any school leader can take to solicit teachers\u2019 leadership and build strong teams:\nL143: \nL144:   * Build a schedule with common planning time so teachers in the same grade level or subject area can meet at least weekly. Then doggedly protect that time so that teachers can count on it.\nL145: \nL146:   * Identify meaningful decisions teams can make, given the authority your school has. These might include what curriculum to use, how to group students, or how to solicit parents\u2019 participation and suggestions.\nL147: \nL148:   * Help teams define clear roles for participants, and provide support and supervision for those who facilitate meetings. \nL149: \nL150:   * Develop a process for keeping other \u00adeducators in the school informed about the teams\u2019 deliberations and \u00addecisions.\nL151: \nL152: ## Meeting the Demands of the Future \nL153: \nL154: This fall, schools\nVisible: 20% - 48%",

In the wake of unprecedented absences during a third pandemic year, everyone has just been asked to give up one planning period a week to cover a colleague\u2019s class. An assistant principal overhears one teacher say to another, \u201cWe\u2019re already covering so many classes as it is. With so much on our plates, it\u2019s not OK that they\u2019re making us do this.\u201d\nL46: \nL47: As their conversation fades, the assistant principal turns to the principal, whose face reveals that she also heard the exchange. \u201cIt\u2019s not like we enjoy making these requests,\u201d the principal says. \u201cIs helping out once a week so hard?\u201d\nL48: \nL49: As this scenario reveals, conflict can arise between teachers and administrators when teachers are not invited to directly give input into the matters that concern them most. My upcoming book, Lead Like a Teache r (W. W. Norton & Co., 2023), explores this question: Why are teachers so often excluded from decisions that directly affect teaching and learning? Three areas allow administrators to draw on teacher expertise to improve their schools: inclusive hiring, reciprocal coaching, and channels of communication.\nL50: \nL51: ### Inclusive Hiring \nL52: \nL53: When a new teacher comes on board, that can be cause for apprehension. What will it be like to work with this person? Will they be a supportive and flexible colleague, or will everyone be stuck with someone who doesn\u2019t pull their weight on the team? Quite often, teachers are not given any role in the hiring process even though it directly affects their working lives. Even though it might be a little extra work to be included in the hiring process, most teachers will gladly contribute the time if they are given the opportunity to weigh in on prospective colleagues and their expertise with curriculum and instruction.\nL54: \nL55: The following actions increase the likelihood of selecting and retaining qualified teachers:\nL56: \nL57:   * Include experienced teachers on the interview panel. It helps if these individuals have varied viewpoints on teaching.\nL58:   * Target the selection process toward instructional expertise by asking teachers for help developing interview questions that dig into a specific grade level or content area. Otherwise, candidates might never speak to their specialized knowledge.\nL59:   * If possible, allow the interview panel to see candidates conduct a mini teaching lesson, either live or via prerecorded video.\nL60: \nL61: Interviews often fail to present a genuine indication of a teacher\u2019s classroom expertise, but with the inclusion of more teacher voice, administrators can make decisions about the long-term success of candidates, and teachers can help select valued colleagues.\nL62: \nL63: ### Reciprocal Coaching \nL64: \nL65: It may be tempting for teachers to keep instruction behind closed doors and not discuss classroom practice with administrators, but this results in a separation between school leadership and instruction. There is a significant benefit to reciprocal coaching, which allows teachers and leaders to engage in structured conversations that guide one another toward more thoughtful practice. Without the experience of sharing goals and observing one another in action, it is much harder for teachers to have professional empathy for administrators and for leaders to have the chance to benefit from a closer connection to classroom practice.\nL66: \nL67: When school leaders outsource instructional coaches or assume that only those in supervisory positions are viable coaches, they miss opportunities to build teacher capacity. To create a culture that embraces coaching, begin by identifying strong teachers who hold positive influence in the building to act as the first round of coach trainers. Then, administrators and the selected teachers can practice coaching one another using a reciprocal protocol that includes three vital actions:\nL68: \nL69:   * Set a professional improvement goal based upon a need that is supported by data,\nL70:   * Identify strategies that support the goal, and \nL71:   * Determine what evidence will demonstrate whether the goal has been achieved.\nL72: \nL73: Suppose the teacher wants to increase opportunities for student-to-student discourse, while the administrator wishes to spend more time conducting classroom observations. They can help one another backward-map toward achieving their targets by first determining what data will indicate the achievement of the stated goal and then selecting one or two strategies that are a match for the situation.\nL74: \nL75: This approach allows each person to hold the other accountable and make useful suggestions during regularly scheduled meetings. When the process is honed and adjusted based on feedback from the pilot group of teachers and leaders, reciprocal coaching will be ready for implementation on a larger scale.\nL76: \nL77: ### Channels of Communication \nL78: \nL79: Administrators are often physically distant from teachers, even when they are in the same room, which can cause undue friction or misunderstandings. Increased opportunities for functional communication leverage teacher expertise by opening stronger interpersonal connections. The power of informal conversation is underrated.\nL80: \nL81: I used to work with an administrator who brought his work into the teacher team room. He would sit down unobtrusively and remain focused on his own task until people engaged him in conversation, ranging from personal to professional topics. Teachers became more accustomed to seeing him in this shared space, and their trust in him grew. The benefit that came out of this was even more significant: Teachers had a place to air their questions and concerns to an accessible leader in a safe space on a regular basis.\nL82: \nL83: Divided attention is another de facto norm of school leadership that acts as an impediment to clear communication because there are so many fires at any given time that require immediate attention. However, when teachers try to talk to administrators who are juggling multiple conversations or devices, it sends a powerful (if unintended) message that leaders are too busy running the school to care about their staff. To send the message that teacher voice matters, these moves make a huge difference:\nL84: \nL85:   * Put devices aside when talking to teachers, full stop. The walkie-talkies and cell phones should be silenced, or they will get in the way of meaningful interaction.\nL86:   * Inner voices are distracting and rife with personal or professional agendas. Try to restrain that voice when listening to teachers.\nL87: \nL88: The expertise of teachers and their role in building stronger schools cannot be overestimated. Including their perspective must be a consistent endeavor if administrators want to bridge the gap between skillful instruction and effective leadership. Starting with the areas of school leadership that call for an instructional lens will produce visible results that increase the shared collaboration between teachers and leaders.\nL89: \nL90: ### Share This Story\nL91: \nL92:   * [Image 0: facebook icon]\nL93:   * [Image 1: twitter icon]\nL94:   * [Image 2: email icon]\nL95: \nL96: ### Filed Under\nL97: \nL98:   * \u301013\u2020Administration & Leadership\u3011\nL99:\nVisible: 0% - 74%",

In the wake of unprecedented absences during a third pandemic year, everyone has just been asked to give up one planning period a week to cover a colleague\u2019s class. An assistant principal overhears one teacher say to another, \u201cWe\u2019re already covering so many classes as it is. With so much on our plates, it\u2019s not OK that they\u2019re making us do this.\u201d\nL46: \nL47: As their conversation fades, the assistant principal turns to the principal, whose face reveals that she also heard the exchange. \u201cIt\u2019s not like we enjoy making these requests,\u201d the principal says. \u201cIs helping out once a week so hard?\u201d\nL48: \nL49: As this scenario reveals, conflict can arise between teachers and administrators when teachers are not invited to directly give input into the matters that concern them most. My upcoming book, Lead Like a Teache r (W. W. Norton & Co., 2023), explores this question: Why are teachers so often excluded from decisions that directly affect teaching and learning? Three areas allow administrators to draw on teacher expertise to improve their schools: inclusive hiring, reciprocal coaching, and channels of communication.\nL50: \nL51: ### Inclusive Hiring \nL52: \nL53: When a new teacher comes on board, that can be cause for apprehension. What will it be like to work with this person? Will they be a supportive and flexible colleague, or will everyone be stuck with someone who doesn\u2019t pull their weight on the team? Quite often, teachers are not given any role in the hiring process even though it directly affects their working lives. Even though it might be a little extra work to be included in the hiring process, most teachers will gladly contribute the time if they are given the opportunity to weigh in on prospective colleagues and their expertise with curriculum and instruction.\nL54: \nL55: The following actions increase the likelihood of selecting and retaining qualified teachers:\nL56: \nL57:   * Include experienced teachers on the interview panel. It helps if these individuals have varied viewpoints on teaching.\nL58:   * Target the selection process toward instructional expertise by asking teachers for help developing interview questions that dig into a specific grade level or content area. Otherwise, candidates might never speak to their specialized knowledge.\nL59:   * If possible, allow the interview panel to see candidates conduct a mini teaching lesson, either live or via prerecorded video.\nL60: \nL61: Interviews often fail to present a genuine indication of a teacher\u2019s classroom expertise, but with the inclusion of more teacher voice, administrators can make decisions about the long-term success of candidates, and teachers can help select valued colleagues.\nL62: \nL63: ### Reciprocal Coaching \nL64: \nL65: It may be tempting for teachers to keep instruction behind closed doors and not discuss classroom practice with administrators, but this results in a separation between school leadership and instruction. There is a significant benefit to reciprocal coaching, which allows teachers and leaders to engage in structured conversations that guide one another toward more thoughtful practice. Without the experience of sharing goals and observing one another in action, it is much harder for teachers to have professional empathy for administrators and for leaders to have the chance to benefit from a closer connection to classroom practice.\nL66: \nL67: When school leaders outsource instructional coaches or assume that only those in supervisory positions are viable coaches, they miss opportunities to build teacher capacity. To create a culture that embraces coaching, begin by identifying strong teachers who hold positive influence in the building to act as the first round of coach trainers. Then, administrators and the selected teachers can practice coaching one another using a reciprocal protocol that includes three vital actions:\nL68: \nL69:   * Set a professional improvement goal based upon a need that is supported by data,\nL70:   * Identify strategies that support the goal, and \nL71:   * Determine what evidence will demonstrate whether the goal has been achieved.\nL72: \nL73: Suppose the teacher wants to increase opportunities for student-to-student discourse, while the administrator wishes to spend more time conducting classroom observations. They can help one another backward-map toward achieving their targets by first determining what data will indicate the achievement of the stated goal and then selecting one or two strategies that are a match for the situation.\nL74: \nL75: This approach allows each person to hold the other accountable and make useful suggestions during regularly scheduled meetings. When the process is honed and adjusted based on feedback from the pilot group of teachers and leaders, reciprocal coaching will be ready for implementation on a larger scale.\nL76: \nL77: ### Channels of Communication \nL78: \nL79: Administrators are often physically distant from teachers, even when they are in the same room, which can cause undue friction or misunderstandings. Increased opportunities for functional communication leverage teacher expertise by opening stronger interpersonal connections. The power of informal conversation is underrated.\nL80: \nL81: I used to work with an administrator who brought his work into the teacher team room. He would sit down unobtrusively and remain focused on his own task until people engaged him in conversation, ranging from personal to professional topics. Teachers became more accustomed to seeing him in this shared space, and their trust in him grew. The benefit that came out of this was even more significant: Teachers had a place to air their questions and concerns to an accessible leader in a safe space on a regular basis.\nL82: \nL83: Divided attention is another de facto norm of school leadership that acts as an impediment to clear communication because there are so many fires at any given time that require immediate attention. However, when teachers try to talk to administrators who are juggling multiple conversations or devices, it sends a powerful (if unintended) message that leaders are too busy running the school to care about their staff. To send the message that teacher voice matters, these moves make a huge difference:\nL84: \nL85:   * Put devices aside when talking to teachers, full stop. The walkie-talkies and cell phones should be silenced, or they will get in the way of meaningful interaction.\nL86:   * Inner voices are distracting and rife with personal or professional agendas. Try to restrain that voice when listening to teachers.\nL87: \nL88: The expertise of teachers and their role in building stronger schools cannot be overestimated. Including their perspective must be a consistent endeavor if administrators want to bridge the gap between skillful instruction and effective leadership. Starting with the areas of school leadership that call for an instructional lens will produce visible results that increase the shared collaboration between teachers and leaders.\nL89: \nL90: ### Share This Story\nL91: \nL92:   * [Image 0: facebook icon]\nL93:   * [Image 1: twitter icon]\nL94:   * [Image 2: email icon]\nL95: \nL96: ### Filed Under\nL97: \nL98:   * Administration & Leadership\nL99:\nVisible: 0% - 74%",

Will they be a supportive and flexible colleague, or will everyone be stuck with someone who doesn\u2019t pull their weight on the team? Quite often, teachers are not given any role in the hiring process even though it directly affects their working lives. Even though it might be a little extra work to be included in the hiring process, most teachers will gladly contribute the time if they are given the opportunity to weigh in on prospective colleagues and their expertise with curriculum and instruction.",

                            "The presence of administrators in teacher team meetings in U.S. public schools can vary, but it is generally considered beneficial for fostering collaborative relationships and effective decision-making. Here are some insights into the role and impact of administrators in these meetings:\n\n1. **Collaborative Culture and Decision-Making**: In some districts, collaboration between teachers and administrators has been institutionalized, creating a culture of shared planning, decision-making, and responsibility. This collaboration can include tackling issues like curriculum development, textbook selection, teacher evaluation, and data-based decision making to improve student performance\u301039\u2020source\u3011\u301040\u2020source\u3011. \n\n2. **Involvement in Team Meetings**: Administrators can significantly contribute to teacher team meetings. For instance, at Guilmette Middle School, the principal relied on teacher teams for implementing online learning, highlighting the importance of existing collaborative structures\u301063\u2020source\u3011. \n\n3. **Benefits of Administrative Participation**: Research indicates that schools with stronger partnerships between teachers and school administration tend to have higher student achievement. Collaborative structures, such as building-level leadership teams and school improvement committees, often include administrators and play a key role in site-based decision making\u301041\u2020source\u3011\u301057\u2020source\u3011.\n\n4. **Challenges and Concerns**: There can be challenges when teachers feel excluded from decisions that affect teaching and learning. It\u2019s important for administrators to actively engage teachers in decision-making processes, including those related to instructional practices and school leadership\u301072\u2020source\u3011\u301078\u2020source\u3011.\n\n5. **Building Trust and Communication**: Administrators being physically present and engaging in informal conversations with teachers can strengthen interpersonal connections and build trust. This approach helps in addressing teachers' concerns and facilitates better communication\u301076\u2020source\u3011.\n\n6. **Reciprocal Coaching and Capacity Building**: The presence of administrators in meetings can also be part of a broader strategy of reciprocal coaching and capacity building within schools. This involves teachers and administrators working together, sharing goals, and observing each other's practices to improve the overall instructional quality\u301074\u2020source\u3011\u301075\u2020source\u3011.\n\nIn summary, while it is not universally mandatory for administrators to be present at all teacher team meetings, their involvement is often seen as beneficial for building a collaborative, effective, and trust-based educational environment. This collaboration can lead to better decision-making, improved student outcomes, and a stronger school culture."

Three areas allow administrators to draw on teacher expertise to improve their schools: inclusive hiring, reciprocal coaching, and channels of communication.",

Increased opportunities for functional communication leverage teacher expertise by opening stronger interpersonal connections. The power of informal conversation is underrated.\n\nI used to work with an administrator who brought his work into the teacher team room. He would sit down unobtrusively and remain focused on his own task until people engaged him in conversation, ranging from personal to professional topics. Teachers became more accustomed to seeing him in this shared space, and their trust in him grew. The benefit that came out of this was even more significant: Teachers had a place to air their questions and concerns to an accessible leader in a safe space on a regular basis.",

Without the experience of sharing goals and observing one another in action, it is much harder for teachers to have professional empathy for administrators and for leaders to have the chance to benefit from a closer connection to classroom practice.",

So, there's no context, but it involves a schedule, and I just want you to take down my words. Schedule is a problem on a spectrum. It affects one of us differently than the other in different ways. It just so happens that I'm affected by three things that form the horn. The reliance on devices and equipment. The problems that go along with that, and the troubleshooting. The illusion of simplicity. The time. I don't have enough time to actually do the stuff. And the demand on one's brain and the constant task switching and the inability to get in the zone. And then the other problem, the other macro problem is, why are we doing this? Why is a schedule so complicated for such a small number of people, and why do they have so much more work to do? You say it's because of reading. I say reading is just a finger on the hand. That is the real problem, and reading is a simpler one. It involves, again, a spectrum of people that it affects. Which is what we don't want. But if we wanted to solve the real problem, we would have to realize that it is a hierarchy again, and the problem lies in the district. But for every level we go out from subset to set, it becomes easier to solve the problems below us. Just transcribe that."

You emphasize the importance of thoughtful and considered approaches, contrasting this with the chaotic reality often experienced, likened to \"herding cats.\" \n\nYou suggest that having come from a journey of personal growth and realization, there's a desire to impart this knowledge in an academic environment. However, the reality seems to be a struggle with discipline, behavior management, and inefficiencies in scheduling and planning. \n\nThe urgency in your message suggests a belief that proactive measures are necessary now to prevent exacerbating the situation. The implication is that waiting could lead to more significant problems, necessitating the need for immediate action to improve planning and scheduling processes, thus enhancing the overall functioning of the system."

                            "This issue with Spotify playing random songs instead of following your playlist can be due to several factors. Here are some common reasons and solutions:\n\n1. **Shuffle Mode**: Ensure that shuffle mode is not activated. When shuffle is on, Spotify will play songs in a random order rather than sequentially.\n\n2. **Spotify Algorithm**: Spotify might play recommended songs based on your listening history. This usually happens if your playlist ends or if it's a shorter playlist.\n\n3. **Premium vs. Free Version**: If you are using the free version of Spotify, it has limitations, such as playing additional songs not in your playlist. Upgrading to Premium gives you full control over your playlists.\n\n4. **App Bugs or Glitches**: Sometimes, bugs or glitches in the app can cause unexpected behavior. Try updating the app, or reinstalling it.\n\n5. **Internet Connection Issues**: A poor internet connection can sometimes affect playback.

If you're not comfortable with that, I can guide you on how to add the HTML to a page directly using the WordPress editor, which is simpler but might be less flexible if you're looking to create a full theme.\n\nPlease provide the details mentioned above so we can proceed."

You can do what you want with the logo, use it if you need to. \n\n```Recall Tony May Messaging Document\n \nMission Statement\nWe are a bipartisan community-rooted group dedicated to fostering accountability within the Garfield RE-2 School Board. Our shared mission is to prioritize student education by keeping the focus on their needs and well-being, free from the influence of politically divisive agendas. We are committed to aligning our district policies with the Strategic Plan set by the district, promoting representation and inclusion for our diverse community, and actively working to recruit and retain all staff members. Through our collaborative efforts, we aim to create an inclusive and effective educational environment that serves the best interests of our students, parents, and the community.\n \nCall to Action\nWith high hopes from the Garfield Re-2 Community and after 2 years in office, Tony May has unfortunately been an unfit School Board President and Board Member.  His conduct is bringing the School District to its foundational limits and threatening our communities.  Recalling Tony May will bring his conduct and actions into democratic light for the betterment of the Garfield Re-2.\n \nObjective\nRespect.\nTransparency.\nCommunity.\n \nIn his attempt to implement a personal agenda, Tony May has compromised the pillars of public office, thereby eroding the trust of the Garfield Re-2 Community in the School Board.\n \nRespect. \nTony May has repeatedly bullied, intimidated, and marginalized his fellow School Board Members, Garfield Re-2 Staff, Parents, and Community Members. His actions have driven multiple School Board members to resign, and staff members currently live in fear of reprimand and retaliation, making it difficult for them to carry out their duties effectively. Additionally, Tony May has shown a lack of respect for speakers and employees by purposely mispronouncing their names and belittling the topics presented. Regardless of political affiliation or worldview, this behavior is unbecoming of any public official, especially a local School Board Member, and is intolerable.\n \nTransparency. \nTony May's actions as School Board President and Board Member have been very concerning to the Garfield Re-2 Community. He has deliberately hid and concealed his efforts to unilaterally push his personal preferences on the community, which have been hidden from various stakeholders, including Garfield Re-2 Staff, other School Board Members, the Press, and the Community at Large. Despite being pressed repeatedly, he has declined to comment publicly on topics of utmost concern to the community. Only after Colorado Open Records Act requests were initiated, did his true communications get revealed. These communications have shown extensive and in-depth conversations with politically motivated actors who live far from the Garfield Re-2 School District. This lack of transparency is unacceptable for any democratically elected official and must be corrected immediately.\n \nCommunity.  Tony May has abused his administrative role as School Board President to attempt to silence district-facilitated community input.  Additionally, he has utilized his voting interest to ignore this same community input without any justification.  Tony May has manipulated established Garfield Re-2 policies that ensure inclusion and buy-in of the larger Community.  Additionally, Tony has deflected and attempted to confuse the public on critical School District functions for the advancement of his personal agenda.  This disregard of community input only undermines its stake in the School District as an institution as well as undermining the greater democratic values our society holds most dear.\n \n____________________________________________________________\n \nRegarding American Birthright Standard\n \nRegarding LGBTQ+   \nDuring the Social Studies Curriculum Review Process, numerous members of the Garfield Re-2 community expressed their concern over how the topic of LGBTQ+ is presented in our schools. The Social Studies Committee reviewed hundreds of comments and concluded that avoiding the subject was not an option.\n\n As a result, the Committee took an unbiased approach and conducted a thorough evaluation of all mentions of \"LGBTQ+\" in the three curriculums. They identified only 12 and 4 mentions in the Adopted and Revised State of Colorado Standards, respectively, out of a total of 414 Outcomes and Expectations. American Birthright had only 1 mention.\n \nUpon evaluation of these mentions in the 2022 Adopted State of Colorado Standards two patterns emerged:\n \nLGBTQ+ is never singled out as a unique, stand-alone subject.  Whenever the topic of LGBTQ+ is shown it is part of a larger list of other minority groups including African American, Latino, religious minorities, etc.  For example, the Fourth Grade Standard 1, shows a student outcome as \u201cDescribe both past and present interactions among the people and cultures in Colorado.  For example: African American, Latino, Asian American, Hawaiian/Pacific Islander, Indigenous Peoples, LGBTQ+, and religious minorities.\u201d  This format of listing the LGBTQ+ people group as part of a larger, specific list of minority communities remains consistent throughout all of the 2022 Adopted and Revised State of Colorado Social Studies Standards. \nLGBTQ+ is never presented as sexuality or gender education.  It was determined by the Social Studies Curriculum Committee that all mentions of LGBTQ+ were only recognition of the people group and were distinct from instruction on sexuality or gender characteristics of the LGBTQ+ group.  In a similar sense, the 2022 Adopted Colorado State Standards also show outcomes and expectations recognizing the contributions and impact of religious minorities but do not mandate the religious education of these groups.  For example, recognizing Jewish or Latter Day Saint people groups as part of the curriculum would be distinct from teaching the religious tenets of Judaism or Mormonism in the classroom.\n \n \nIt is important to note that Tony May attempted to not allow the presentation and vote to take place at the 10/25 Board Meeting by removing both from the agenda.\n \nFortunately, other School Board members intervened against Tony May's actions, ensuring that the Social Studies Curriculum Committee was able to conclude the Garfield Re-2 School Board endorsed and facilitated process. The process aimed to evaluate our community values and determine the best course of action. Although the ultimate answer may not represent everyone's opinion throughout the community, the procedure was an inclusive, objective operation that pursued consensus at every opportunity. Tony May worked against this process until the end, driven by undisclosed personal preferences, and undermined community input and buy-in as a result.\n \nTony May voted no against the committee recommendation of the 2022 Adopted State Standards. He also voted no on the 2022 Revised State Standards, showing that he would not accept anything other than American Birthright Standards, his personal agenda that does not align with the diverse range of perspectives and beliefs in our community regarding this topic.\n \nWith the help of the rest of the current board we were able to put the standards portion to bed, but as Tony May said at the end of the 10/25 meeting \u2013 This is not over.\n \nWe must stay vigilant to ensure that Tony May does not convince the newcomers to the board to make radical changes to the district while we are in our recall process. \n```"

Based on your requirements for a modern, clean, and easily navigable site that is optimized for both desktop and mobile, I will create a basic HTML and CSS structure that reflects a minimal yet modern design aesthetic.\n\nI will ensure that the logo is used appropriately, perhaps as a header element or part of the navigation bar. The HTML will be structured with clear sections reflecting your mission statement, call to action, and other key content areas, and will be styled with CSS for a clean and professional look.\n\nSince the full text for each section can be quite lengthy, I will include only the first sentence followed by \"...\" as placeholders where you can later add the full content.\n\nI'll now proceed to create the code for your site. Please wait a moment while I prepare it."

His actions have driven multiple School Board members to resign, and staff members currently live in fear of reprimand and retaliation, making it difficult for them to carry out their duties effectively. Additionally, Tony May has shown a lack of respect for speakers and employees by purposely mispronouncing their names and belittling the topics presented. Regardless of political affiliation or worldview, this behavior is unbecoming of any public official, especially a local School Board Member, and is intolerable.\n \nTransparency. \nTony May's actions as School Board President and Board Member have been very concerning to the Garfield Re-2 Community. He has deliberately hid and concealed his efforts to unilaterally push his personal preferences on the community, which have been hidden from various stakeholders, including Garfield Re-2 Staff, other School Board Members, the Press, and the Community at Large. Despite being pressed repeatedly, he has declined to comment publicly on topics of utmost concern to the community. Only after Colorado Open Records Act requests were initiated, did his true communications get revealed. These communications have shown extensive and in-depth conversations with politically motivated actors who live far from the Garfield Re-2 School District. This lack of transparency is unacceptable for any democratically elected official and must be corrected immediately.\n \nCommunity.  Tony May has abused his administrative role as School Board President to attempt to silence district-facilitated community input.  Additionally, he has utilized his voting interest to ignore this same community input without any justification.  Tony May has manipulated established Garfield Re-2 policies that ensure inclusion and buy-in of the larger Community.  Additionally, Tony has deflected and attempted to confuse the public on critical School District functions for the advancement of his personal agenda.  This disregard of community input only undermines its stake in the School District as an institution as well as undermining the greater democratic values our society holds most dear.```\n"

Our shared mission is to prioritize student education by keeping the focus on their needs and\nL10: well-being free from the influence of politically divisive agendas. We are committed to aligning our district\nL11: policies with the Strategic Plan set by the district promoting representation and inclusion for our diverse\nL12: community and actively working to recruit and retain all staff members. Through our collaborative efforts we\nL13: aim to create an inclusive and effective educational environment that serves the best interests of our students\nL14: parents and the community.\nL15: \nL16: \nL17: Call to Action\nL18: \nL19: \nL20: With high hopes from the Garfield Re-2 Community and after 2 years in office Tony May has unfortunately\nL21: been an unfit School Board President and Board Member. His conduct is bringing the School District to its\nL22: foundational limits and threatening our communities. Recalling Tony May will bring his conduct and actions\nL23: into democratic light for the betterment of the Garfield Re-2.\nL24: \nL25: \nL26: Objective\nL27: \nL28: \nL29: Respect.\nL30: \nL31: \nL32: Transparency.\nL33: \nL34: \nL35: Community.\nL36: \nL37: \nL38: In his attempt to implement a personal agenda Tony May has compromised the pillars of public office thereby\nL39: eroding the trust of the Garfield Re-2 Community in the School Board.\nL40: \nL41: \nL42: Respect.\nL43: \nL44: \nL45: Tony May has repeatedly bullied intimidated and marginalized his fellow School Board Members\nL46: Garfield Re-2 Staff Parents and Community Members. His actions have driven multiple School\nL47: Board members to resign and staff members currently live in fear of reprimand and retaliation\nL48: making it difficult for them to carry out their duties effectively. Additionally Tony May has shown a lack\nL49: of respect for speakers and employees by purposely mispronouncing their names and belittling the\nL50: topics presented. Regardless of political affiliation or worldview this behavior is unbecoming of any\nL51: public official especially a local School Board Member and is intolerable.\nL52: \nL53: Transparency.\nL54: \nL55: \nL56: Tony May's actions as School Board President and Board Member have been very concerning to the\nL57: Garfield Re-2 Community. He has deliberately hid and concealed his efforts to unilaterally push his\nL58: personal preferences on the community which have been hidden from various stakeholders\nL59: including Garfield Re-2 Staff other School Board Members the Press and the Community at Large.\nL60: Despite being pressed repeatedly he has declined to comment publicly on topics of utmost concern\nL61: to the community. Only after Colorado Open Records Act requests were initiated did his true\nL62: communications get revealed. These communications have shown extensive and in-depth\nL63: conversations with politically motivated actors who live far from the Garfield Re-2 School District. This\nL64: lack of transparency is unacceptable for any democratically elected official and must be corrected\nL65: immediately.\nL66: \nL67: \nL68: Community. Tony May has abused his administrative role as School Board President to attempt to\nL69: silence district-facilitated community input. Additionally he has utilized his voting interest to ignore\nL70: this same community input without any justification. Tony May has manipulated established Garfield\nL71: Re-2 policies that ensure inclusion and buy-in of the larger Community. Additionally Tony has\nL72: deflected and attempted to confuse the public on critical School District functions for the\nL73: advancement of his personal agenda. This disregard of community input only undermines its stake in\nL74: the School District as an institution as well as undermining the greater democratic values our society\nL75: holds most dear.\nL76: \nL77: \nL78: ____________________________________________________________\nL79: \nL80: \nL81: Regarding American Birthright Standard\nL82: \nL83: \nL84: Regarding LGBTQ+\nL85: \nL86: \nL87: During the Social Studies Curriculum Review Process numerous members of the Garfield Re-2\nL88: community expressed their concern over how the topic of LGBTQ+ is presented in our schools. The\nL89: Social Studies Committee reviewed hundreds of comments and concluded that avoiding the subject\nL90: was not an option.\nL91: \nL92: \nL93: As a result the Committee took an unbiased approach and conducted a thorough evaluation of all\nL94: mentions of \"LGBTQ+\" in the three curriculums. They identified only 12 and 4 mentions in the\nL95: Adopted and Revised State of Colorado Standards respectively out of a total of 414 Outcomes and\nL96: Expectations. American Birthright had only 1 mention.\nL97: \nL98: Upon evaluation of these mentions in the 2022 Adopted State of Colorado Standards two patterns emerged:\nL99: \nL100: \nL101: 1. LGBTQ+ is never singled out as a unique stand-alone subject. Whenever the topic of\nL102: LGBTQ+ is shown it is part of a larger list of other minority groups including African American Latino\nL103: religious minorities etc. For example the Fourth Grade Standard 1 shows a student outcome as\nL104: \u201cDescribe both past and present interactions among the people and cultures in Colorado. For\nL105: example: African American Latino Asian American Hawaiian/Pacific Islander Indigenous Peoples\nL106: LGBTQ+ and religious minorities.\u201d This format of listing the LGBTQ+ people group as part of a larger\nL107: specific list of minority communities remains consistent throughout all of the 2022 Adopted and\nL108: Revised State of Colorado Social Studies Standards.\nL109: 2. LGBTQ+ is never presented as sexuality or gender education. It was determined by the Social\nL110: Studies Curriculum Committee that all mentions of LGBTQ+ were only recognition of the people group\nL111: and were distinct from instruction on sexuality or gender characteristics of the LGBTQ+ group. In a\nL112: similar sense the 2022 Adopted Colorado State Standards also show outcomes and expectations\nL113: recognizing the contributions and impact of religious minorities but do not mandate the religious\nL114: education of these groups. For example recognizing Jewish or Latter Day Saint people groups as part\nL115: of the curriculum would be distinct from teaching the religious tenets of Judaism or Mormonism in the\nL116: classroom.\nL117: \nL118: \nL119: It is important to note that Tony May attempted to not allow the presentation and vote to take place at\nL120: the 10/25 Board Meeting by removing both from the agenda.\nL121: \nL122: \nL123: Fortunately other School Board members intervened against Tony May's actions ensuring that the\nL124: Social Studies Curriculum Committee was able to conclude the Garfield Re-2 School Board endorsed\nL125: and facilitated process. The process aimed to evaluate our community values and determine the best\nL126: course of action. Although the ultimate answer may not represent everyone's opinion throughout the\nL127: community the procedure was an inclusive objective operation that pursued consensus at every\nL128: opportunity. Tony May worked against this process until the end driven by undisclosed personal\nL129: preferences and undermined community input and buy-in as a result.\nL130: \nL131: \nL132: Tony May voted no against the committee recommendation of the 2022 Adopted State Standards. He\nL133: also voted no on the 2022 Revised State Standards showing that he would not accept anything other\nL134: than American Birthright Standards his personal agenda that does not align with the diverse range of\nL135: perspectives and beliefs in our community regarding this topic.\nL136: \nL137: With the help of the rest of the current board we were able to put the standards portion to bed but as\nL138: Tony May said at the end of the 10/25 meeting \u2013 This is not over.\nL139: \nL140: \nL141: We must stay vigilant to ensure that Tony May does not convince the newcomers to the board to\nL142: make radical changes to the district while we are in our recall process.\nVisible: 0% - 100%",

Our shared mission is to prioritize student education by keeping the focus on their needs and\nL10: well-being free from the influence of politically divisive agendas. We are committed to aligning our district\nL11: policies with the Strategic Plan set by the district promoting representation and inclusion for our diverse\nL12: community and actively working to recruit and retain all staff members. Through our collaborative efforts we\nL13: aim to create an inclusive and effective educational environment that serves the best interests of our students\nL14: parents and the community.\nL15: \nL16: \nL17: Call to Action\nL18: \nL19: \nL20: With high hopes from the Garfield Re-2 Community and after 2 years in office Tony May has unfortunately\nL21: been an unfit School Board President and Board Member. His conduct is bringing the School District to its\nL22: foundational limits and threatening our communities. Recalling Tony May will bring his conduct and actions\nL23: into democratic light for the betterment of the Garfield Re-2.\nL24: \nL25: \nL26: Objective\nL27: \nL28: \nL29: Respect.\nL30: \nL31: \nL32: Transparency.\nL33: \nL34: \nL35: Community.\nL36: \nL37: \nL38: In his attempt to implement a personal agenda Tony May has compromised the pillars of public office thereby\nL39: eroding the trust of the Garfield Re-2 Community in the School Board.\nL40: \nL41: \nL42: Respect.\nL43: \nL44: \nL45: Tony May has repeatedly bullied intimidated and marginalized his fellow School Board Members\nL46: Garfield Re-2 Staff Parents and Community Members. His actions have driven multiple School\nL47: Board members to resign and staff members currently live in fear of reprimand and retaliation\nL48: making it difficult for them to carry out their duties effectively. Additionally Tony May has shown a lack\nL49: of respect for speakers and employees by purposely mispronouncing their names and belittling the\nL50: topics presented. Regardless of political affiliation or worldview this behavior is unbecoming of any\nL51: public official especially a local School Board Member and is intolerable.\nL52: \nL53: Transparency.\nL54: \nL55: \nL56: Tony May's actions as School Board President and Board Member have been very concerning to the\nL57: Garfield Re-2 Community. He has deliberately hid and concealed his efforts to unilaterally push his\nL58: personal preferences on the community which have been hidden from various stakeholders\nL59: including Garfield Re-2 Staff other School Board Members the Press and the Community at Large.\nL60: Despite being pressed repeatedly he has declined to comment publicly on topics of utmost concern\nL61: to the community. Only after Colorado Open Records Act requests were initiated did his true\nL62: communications get revealed. These communications have shown extensive and in-depth\nL63: conversations with politically motivated actors who live far from the Garfield Re-2 School District. This\nL64: lack of transparency is unacceptable for any democratically elected official and must be corrected\nL65: immediately.\nL66: \nL67: \nL68: Community. Tony May has abused his administrative role as School Board President to attempt to\nL69: silence district-facilitated community input. Additionally he has utilized his voting interest to ignore\nL70: this same community input without any justification. Tony May has manipulated established Garfield\nL71: Re-2 policies that ensure inclusion and buy-in of the larger Community. Additionally Tony has\nL72: deflected and attempted to confuse the public on critical School District functions for the\nL73: advancement of his personal agenda. This disregard of community input only undermines its stake in\nL74: the School District as an institution as well as undermining the greater democratic values our society\nL75: holds most dear.\nL76: \nL77: \nL78: ____________________________________________________________\nL79: \nL80: \nL81: Regarding American Birthright Standard\nL82: \nL83: \nL84: Regarding LGBTQ+\nL85: \nL86: \nL87: During the Social Studies Curriculum Review Process numerous members of the Garfield Re-2\nL88: community expressed their concern over how the topic of LGBTQ+ is presented in our schools. The\nL89: Social Studies Committee reviewed hundreds of comments and concluded that avoiding the subject\nL90: was not an option.\nL91: \nL92: \nL93: As a result the Committee took an unbiased approach and conducted a thorough evaluation of all\nL94: mentions of \"LGBTQ+\" in the three curriculums. They identified only 12 and 4 mentions in the\nL95: Adopted and Revised State of Colorado Standards respectively out of a total of 414 Outcomes and\nL96: Expectations. American Birthright had only 1 mention.\nL97: \nL98: Upon evaluation of these mentions in the 2022 Adopted State of Colorado Standards two patterns emerged:\nL99: \nL100: \nL101: 1. LGBTQ+ is never singled out as a unique stand-alone subject. Whenever the topic of\nL102: LGBTQ+ is shown it is part of a larger list of other minority groups including African American Latino\nL103: religious minorities etc. For example the Fourth Grade Standard 1 shows a student outcome as\nL104: \u201cDescribe both past and present interactions among the people and cultures in Colorado. For\nL105: example: African American Latino Asian American Hawaiian/Pacific Islander Indigenous Peoples\nL106: LGBTQ+ and religious minorities.\u201d This format of listing the LGBTQ+ people group as part of a larger\nL107: specific list of minority communities remains consistent throughout all of the 2022 Adopted and\nL108: Revised State of Colorado Social Studies Standards.\nL109: 2. LGBTQ+ is never presented as sexuality or gender education. It was determined by the Social\nL110: Studies Curriculum Committee that all mentions of LGBTQ+ were only recognition of the people group\nL111: and were distinct from instruction on sexuality or gender characteristics of the LGBTQ+ group. In a\nL112: similar sense the 2022 Adopted Colorado State Standards also show outcomes and expectations\nL113: recognizing the contributions and impact of religious minorities but do not mandate the religious\nL114: education of these groups. For example recognizing Jewish or Latter Day Saint people groups as part\nL115: of the curriculum would be distinct from teaching the religious tenets of Judaism or Mormonism in the\nL116: classroom.\nL117: \nL118: \nL119: It is important to note that Tony May attempted to not allow the presentation and vote to take place at\nL120: the 10/25 Board Meeting by removing both from the agenda.\nL121: \nL122: \nL123: Fortunately other School Board members intervened against Tony May's actions ensuring that the\nL124: Social Studies Curriculum Committee was able to conclude the Garfield Re-2 School Board endorsed\nL125: and facilitated process. The process aimed to evaluate our community values and determine the best\nL126: course of action. Although the ultimate answer may not represent everyone's opinion throughout the\nL127: community the procedure was an inclusive objective operation that pursued consensus at every\nL128: opportunity. Tony May worked against this process until the end driven by undisclosed personal\nL129: preferences and undermined community input and buy-in as a result.\nL130: \nL131: \nL132: Tony May voted no against the committee recommendation of the 2022 Adopted State Standards. He\nL133: also voted no on the 2022 Revised State Standards showing that he would not accept anything other\nL134: than American Birthright Standards his personal agenda that does not align with the diverse range of\nL135: perspectives and beliefs in our community regarding this topic.\nL136: \nL137: With the help of the rest of the current board we were able to put the standards portion to bed but as\nL138: Tony May said at the end of the 10/25 meeting \u2013 This is not over.\nL139: \nL140: \nL141: We must stay vigilant to ensure that Tony May does not convince the newcomers to the board to\nL142: make radical changes to the district while we are in our recall process.\nVisible: 0% - 100%"

Our shared mission is to prioritize student education by keeping the focus on their needs and\nL10: well-being free from the influence of politically divisive agendas. We are committed to aligning our district\nL11: policies with the Strategic Plan set by the district promoting representation and inclusion for our diverse\nL12: community and actively working to recruit and retain all staff members. Through our collaborative efforts we\nL13: aim to create an inclusive and effective educational environment that serves the best interests of our students\nL14: parents and the community.\nL15: \nL16: \nL17: Call to Action\nL18: \nL19: \nL20: With high hopes from the Garfield Re-2 Community and after 2 years in office Tony May has unfortunately\nL21: been an unfit School Board President and Board Member. His conduct is bringing the School District to its\nL22: foundational limits and threatening our communities. Recalling Tony May will bring his conduct and actions\nL23: into democratic light for the betterment of the Garfield Re-2.\nL24: \nL25: \nL26: Objective\nL27: \nL28: \nL29: Respect.\nL30: \nL31: \nL32: Transparency.\nL33: \nL34: \nL35: Community.\nL36: \nL37: \nL38: In his attempt to implement a personal agenda Tony May has compromised the pillars of public office thereby\nL39: eroding the trust of the Garfield Re-2 Community in the School Board.\nL40: \nL41: \nL42: Respect.\nL43: \nL44: \nL45: Tony May has repeatedly bullied intimidated and marginalized his fellow School Board Members\nL46: Garfield Re-2 Staff Parents and Community Members. His actions have driven multiple School\nL47: Board members to resign and staff members currently live in fear of reprimand and retaliation\nL48: making it difficult for them to carry out their duties effectively. Additionally Tony May has shown a lack\nL49: of respect for speakers and employees by purposely mispronouncing their names and belittling the\nL50: topics presented. Regardless of political affiliation or worldview this behavior is unbecoming of any\nL51: public official especially a local School Board Member and is intolerable.\nL52: \nL53: Transparency.\nL54: \nL55: \nL56: Tony May's actions as School Board President and Board Member have been very concerning to the\nL57: Garfield Re-2 Community. He has deliberately hid and concealed his efforts to unilaterally push his\nL58: personal preferences on the community which have been hidden from various stakeholders\nL59: including Garfield Re-2 Staff other School Board Members the Press and the Community at Large.\nL60: Despite being pressed repeatedly he has declined to comment publicly on topics of utmost concern\nL61: to the community. Only after Colorado Open Records Act requests were initiated did his true\nL62: communications get revealed. These communications have shown extensive and in-depth\nL63: conversations with politically motivated actors who live far from the Garfield Re-2 School District. This\nL64: lack of transparency is unacceptable for any democratically elected official and must be corrected\nL65: immediately.\nL66: \nL67: \nL68: Community. Tony May has abused his administrative role as School Board President to attempt to\nL69: silence district-facilitated community input. Additionally he has utilized his voting interest to ignore\nL70: this same community input without any justification. Tony May has manipulated established Garfield\nL71: Re-2 policies that ensure inclusion and buy-in of the larger Community. Additionally Tony has\nL72: deflected and attempted to confuse the public on critical School District functions for the\nL73: advancement of his personal agenda. This disregard of community input only undermines its stake in\nL74: the School District as an institution as well as undermining the greater democratic values our society\nL75: holds most dear.\nL76: \nL77: \nL78: ____________________________________________________________\nL79: \nL80: \nL81: Regarding American Birthright Standard\nL82: \nL83: \nL84: Regarding LGBTQ+\nL85: \nL86: \nL87: During the Social Studies Curriculum Review Process numerous members of the Garfield Re-2\nL88: community expressed their concern over how the topic of LGBTQ+ is presented in our schools. The\nL89: Social Studies Committee reviewed hundreds of comments and concluded that avoiding the subject\nL90: was not an option.\nL91: \nL92: \nL93: As a result the Committee took an unbiased approach and conducted a thorough evaluation of all\nL94: mentions of \"LGBTQ+\" in the three curriculums. They identified only 12 and 4 mentions in the\nL95: Adopted and Revised State of Colorado Standards respectively out of a total of 414 Outcomes and\nL96: Expectations. American Birthright had only 1 mention.\nL97: \nL98: Upon evaluation of these mentions in the 2022 Adopted State of Colorado Standards two patterns emerged:\nL99: \nL100: \nL101: 1. LGBTQ+ is never singled out as a unique stand-alone subject. Whenever the topic of\nL102: LGBTQ+ is shown it is part of a larger list of other minority groups including African American Latino\nL103: religious minorities etc. For example the Fourth Grade Standard 1 shows a student outcome as\nL104: \u201cDescribe both past and present interactions among the people and cultures in Colorado. For\nL105: example: African American Latino Asian American Hawaiian/Pacific Islander Indigenous Peoples\nL106: LGBTQ+ and religious minorities.\u201d This format of listing the LGBTQ+ people group as part of a larger\nL107: specific list of minority communities remains consistent throughout all of the 2022 Adopted and\nL108: Revised State of Colorado Social Studies Standards.\nL109: 2. LGBTQ+ is never presented as sexuality or gender education. It was determined by the Social\nL110: Studies Curriculum Committee that all mentions of LGBTQ+ were only recognition of the people group\nL111: and were distinct from instruction on sexuality or gender characteristics of the LGBTQ+ group. In a\nL112: similar sense the 2022 Adopted Colorado State Standards also show outcomes and expectations\nL113: recognizing the contributions and impact of religious minorities but do not mandate the religious\nL114: education of these groups. For example recognizing Jewish or Latter Day Saint people groups as part\nL115: of the curriculum would be distinct from teaching the religious tenets of Judaism or Mormonism in the\nL116: classroom.\nL117: \nL118: \nL119: It is important to note that Tony May attempted to not allow the presentation and vote to take place at\nL120: the 10/25 Board Meeting by removing both from the agenda.\nL121: \nL122: \nL123: Fortunately other School Board members intervened against Tony May's actions ensuring that the\nL124: Social Studies Curriculum Committee was able to conclude the Garfield Re-2 School Board endorsed\nL125: and facilitated process. The process aimed to evaluate our community values and determine the best\nL126: course of action.

Our shared mission is to prioritize student education by keeping the focus on their needs and\nL10: well-being free from the influence of politically divisive agendas. We are committed to aligning our district\nL11: policies with the Strategic Plan set by the district promoting representation and inclusion for our diverse\nL12: community and actively working to recruit and retain all staff members. Through our collaborative efforts we\nL13: aim to create an inclusive and effective educational environment that serves the best interests of our students\nL14: parents and the community.\nL15: \nL16: \nL17: Call to Action\nL18: \nL19: \nL20: With high hopes from the Garfield Re-2 Community and after 2 years in office Tony May has unfortunately\nL21: been an unfit School Board President and Board Member. His conduct is bringing the School District to its\nL22: foundational limits and threatening our communities. Recalling Tony May will bring his conduct and actions\nL23: into democratic light for the betterment of the Garfield Re-2.\nL24: \nL25: \nL26: Objective\nL27: \nL28: \nL29: Respect.\nL30: \nL31: \nL32: Transparency.\nL33: \nL34: \nL35: Community.\nL36: \nL37: \nL38: In his attempt to implement a personal agenda Tony May has compromised the pillars of public office thereby\nL39: eroding the trust of the Garfield Re-2 Community in the School Board.\nL40: \nL41: \nL42: Respect.\nL43: \nL44: \nL45: Tony May has repeatedly bullied intimidated and marginalized his fellow School Board Members\nL46: Garfield Re-2 Staff Parents and Community Members. His actions have driven multiple School\nL47: Board members to resign and staff members currently live in fear of reprimand and retaliation\nL48: making it difficult for them to carry out their duties effectively. Additionally Tony May has shown a lack\nL49: of respect for speakers and employees by purposely mispronouncing their names and belittling the\nL50: topics presented. Regardless of political affiliation or worldview this behavior is unbecoming of any\nL51: public official especially a local School Board Member and is intolerable.\nL52: \nL53: Transparency.\nL54: \nL55: \nL56: Tony May's actions as School Board President and Board Member have been very concerning to the\nL57: Garfield Re-2 Community. He has deliberately hid and concealed his efforts to unilaterally push his\nL58: personal preferences on the community which have been hidden from various stakeholders\nL59: including Garfield Re-2 Staff other School Board Members the Press and the Community at Large.\nL60: Despite being pressed repeatedly he has declined to comment publicly on topics of utmost concern\nL61: to the community. Only after Colorado Open Records Act requests were initiated did his true\nL62: communications get revealed. These communications have shown extensive and in-depth\nL63: conversations with politically motivated actors who live far from the Garfield Re-2 School District. This\nL64: lack of transparency is unacceptable for any democratically elected official and must be corrected\nL65: immediately.\nL66: \nL67: \nL68: Community. Tony May has abused his administrative role as School Board President to attempt to\nL69: silence district-facilitated community input. Additionally he has utilized his voting interest to ignore\nL70: this same community input without any justification. Tony May has manipulated established Garfield\nL71: Re-2 policies that ensure inclusion and buy-in of the larger Community. Additionally Tony has\nL72: deflected and attempted to confuse the public on critical School District functions for the\nL73: advancement of his personal agenda. This disregard of community input only undermines its stake in\nL74: the School District as an institution as well as undermining the greater democratic values our society\nL75: holds most dear.\nL76: \nL77: \nL78: ____________________________________________________________\nL79: \nL80: \nL81: Regarding American Birthright Standard\nL82: \nL83: \nL84: Regarding LGBTQ+\nL85: \nL86: \nL87: During the Social Studies Curriculum Review Process numerous members of the Garfield Re-2\nL88: community expressed their concern over how the topic of LGBTQ+ is presented in our schools. The\nL89: Social Studies Committee reviewed hundreds of comments and concluded that avoiding the subject\nL90: was not an option.\nL91: \nL92: \nL93: As a result the Committee took an unbiased approach and conducted a thorough evaluation of all\nL94: mentions of \"LGBTQ+\" in the three curriculums. They identified only 12 and 4 mentions in the\nL95: Adopted and Revised State of Colorado Standards respectively out of a total of 414 Outcomes and\nL96: Expectations. American Birthright had only 1 mention.\nL97: \nL98: Upon evaluation of these mentions in the 2022 Adopted State of Colorado Standards two patterns emerged:\nL99: \nL100: \nL101: 1. LGBTQ+ is never singled out as a unique stand-alone subject. Whenever the topic of\nL102: LGBTQ+ is shown it is part of a larger list of other minority groups including African American Latino\nL103: religious minorities etc. For example the Fourth Grade Standard 1 shows a student outcome as\nL104: \u201cDescribe both past and present interactions among the people and cultures in Colorado. For\nL105: example: African American Latino Asian American Hawaiian/Pacific Islander Indigenous Peoples\nL106: LGBTQ+ and religious minorities.\u201d This format of listing the LGBTQ+ people group as part of a larger\nL107: specific list of minority communities remains consistent throughout all of the 2022 Adopted and\nL108: Revised State of Colorado Social Studies Standards.\nL109: 2. LGBTQ+ is never presented as sexuality or gender education. It was determined by the Social\nL110: Studies Curriculum Committee that all mentions of LGBTQ+ were only recognition of the people group\nL111: and were distinct from instruction on sexuality or gender characteristics of the LGBTQ+ group. In a\nL112: similar sense the 2022 Adopted Colorado State Standards also show outcomes and expectations\nL113: recognizing the contributions and impact of religious minorities but do not mandate the religious\nL114: education of these groups. For example recognizing Jewish or Latter Day Saint people groups as part\nL115: of the curriculum would be distinct from teaching the religious tenets of Judaism or Mormonism in the\nL116: classroom.\nL117: \nL118: \nL119: It is important to note that Tony May attempted to not allow the presentation and vote to take place at\nL120: the 10/25 Board Meeting by removing both from the agenda.\nL121: \nL122: \nL123: Fortunately other School Board members intervened against Tony May's actions ensuring that the\nL124: Social Studies Curriculum Committee was able to conclude the Garfield Re-2 School Board endorsed\nL125: and facilitated process. The process aimed to evaluate our community values and determine the best\nL126: course of action. Although the ultimate answer may not represent everyone's opinion throughout the\nL127: community the procedure was an inclusive objective operation that pursued consensus at every\nL128: opportunity. Tony May worked against this process until the end driven by undisclosed personal\nL129: preferences and undermined community input and buy-in as a result.\nL130: \nL131: \nL132: Tony May voted no against the committee recommendation of the 2022 Adopted State Standards. He\nL133: also voted no on the 2022 Revised State Standards showing that he would not accept anything other\nL134: than American Birthright Standards his personal agenda that does not align with the diverse range of\nL135: perspectives and beliefs in our community regarding this topic.\nL136: \nL137: With the help of the rest of the current board we were able to put the standards portion to bed but as\nL138: Tony May said at the end of the 10/25 meeting \u2013 This is not over.\nL139: \nL140: \nL141: We must stay vigilant to ensure that Tony May does not convince the newcomers to the board to\nL142: make radical changes to the district while we are in our recall process.\nVisible: 0% - 100%"

Here's what I will do:\n\n1. **Responsive Design**: Ensure that the website is responsive, adjusting seamlessly to different screen sizes, particularly for mobile devices.\n2. **Modern Fonts**: Use modern web fonts for better readability and aesthetics.\n3. **Color Scheme**: Implement a color scheme that is vibrant and appealing to a youthful audience while maintaining readability.\n4. **Interactive Elements**: Introduce interactive elements such as hover effects on links and buttons for better user engagement.\n5. **Navigation**: Improve the navigation menu for mobile viewing, often using a hamburger menu for smaller screens.\n6. **Layout**: Optimize the layout with spacing and alignment adjustments to make content more digestible.\n\nI will now proceed to make these enhancements to the HTML and CSS code. Once done, you will have a more modern, functional, and mobile-friendly website design. Please wait a moment while I prepare the updated code."

The\nL89: Social Studies Committee reviewed hundreds of comments and concluded that avoiding the subject\nL90: was not an option.\nL91: \nL92: \nL93: As a result the Committee took an unbiased approach and conducted a thorough evaluation of all\nL94: mentions of \"LGBTQ+\" in the three curriculums. They identified only 12 and 4 mentions in the\nL95: Adopted and Revised State of Colorado Standards respectively out of a total of 414 Outcomes and\nL96: Expectations.

LGBTQ+ is never singled out as a unique stand-alone subject. Whenever the topic of\nL102: LGBTQ+ is shown it is part of a larger list of other minority groups including African American Latino\nL103: religious minorities etc. For example the Fourth Grade Standard 1 shows a student outcome as\nL104: \u201cDescribe both past and present interactions among the people and cultures in Colorado. For\nL105: example: African American Latino Asian American Hawaiian/Pacific Islander Indigenous Peoples\nL106: LGBTQ+ and religious minorities.\u201d This format of listing the LGBTQ+ people group as part of a larger\nL107: specific list of minority communities remains consistent throughout all of the 2022 Adopted and\nL108: Revised State of Colorado Social Studies Standards.\nL109: 2. LGBTQ+ is never presented as sexuality or gender education. It was determined by the Social\nL110: Studies Curriculum Committee that all mentions of LGBTQ+ were only recognition of the people group\nL111: and were distinct from instruction on sexuality or gender characteristics of the LGBTQ+ group. In a\nL112: similar sense the 2022 Adopted Colorado State Standards also show outcomes and expectations\nL113: recognizing the contributions and impact of religious minorities but do not mandate the religious\nL114: education of these groups. For example recognizing Jewish or Latter Day Saint people groups as part\nL115: of the curriculum would be distinct from teaching the religious tenets of Judaism or Mormonism in the\nL116: classroom.\nL117: \nL118: \nL119: It is important to note that Tony May attempted to not allow the presentation and vote to take place at\nL120: the 10/25 Board Meeting by removing both from the agenda.\nL121: \nL122: \nL123: Fortunately other School Board members intervened against Tony May's actions ensuring that the\nL124: Social Studies Curriculum Committee was able to conclude the Garfield Re-2 School Board endorsed\nL125: and facilitated process. The process aimed to evaluate our community values and determine the best\nL126: course of action. Although the ultimate answer may not represent everyone's opinion throughout the\nL127: community the procedure was an inclusive objective operation that pursued consensus at every\nL128: opportunity. Tony May worked against this process until the end driven by undisclosed personal\nL129: preferences and undermined community input and buy-in as a result.\nL130: \nL131: \nL132: Tony May voted no against the committee recommendation of the 2022 Adopted State Standards. He\nL133: also voted no on the 2022 Revised State Standards showing that he would not accept anything other\nL134: than American Birthright Standards his personal agenda that does not align with the diverse range of\nL135: perspectives and beliefs in our community regarding this topic.\nL136: \nL137: With the help of the rest of the current board we were able to put the standards portion to bed but as\nL138: Tony May said at the end of the 10/25 meeting \u2013 This is not over.\nL139: \nL140: \nL141: We must stay vigilant to ensure that Tony May does not convince the newcomers to the board to\nL142: make radical changes to the district while we are in our recall process.\nVisible: 0% - 100%",

His conduct is bringing the School District to its\nfoundational limits and threatening our communities. Recalling Tony May will bring his conduct and actions\ninto democratic light for the betterment of the Garfield Re-2.\n\n\nObjective\n\n\nRespect.\n\n\nTransparency.\n\n\nCommunity.\n\n\nIn his attempt to implement a personal agenda Tony May has compromised the pillars of public office thereby\neroding the trust of the Garfield Re-2 Community in the School Board.\n\n\nRespect.\n\n\nTony May has repeatedly bullied intimidated and marginalized his fellow School Board Members\nGarfield Re-2 Staff Parents and Community Members. His actions have driven multiple School\nBoard members to resign and staff members currently live in fear of reprimand and retaliation\nmaking it difficult for them to carry out their duties effectively. Additionally Tony May has shown a lack\nof respect for speakers and employees by purposely mispronouncing their names and belittling the\ntopics presented. Regardless of political affiliation or worldview this behavior is unbecoming of any\npublic official especially a local School Board Member and is intolerable.\n\nTransparency.\n\n\nTony May's actions as School Board President and Board Member have been very concerning to the\nGarfield Re-2 Community. He has deliberately hid and concealed his efforts to unilaterally push his\npersonal preferences on the community which have been hidden from various stakeholders\nincluding Garfield Re-2 Staff other School Board Members the Press and the Community at Large.\nDespite being pressed repeatedly he has declined to comment publicly on topics of utmost concern\nto the community. Only after Colorado Open Records Act requests were initiated did his true\ncommunications get revealed. These communications have shown extensive and in-depth\nconversations with politically motivated actors who live far from the Garfield Re-2 School District. This\nlack of transparency is unacceptable for any democratically elected official and must be corrected\nimmediately.\n\n\nCommunity. Tony May has abused his administrative role as School Board President to attempt to\nsilence district-facilitated community input.

The\nSocial Studies Committee reviewed hundreds of comments and concluded that avoiding the subject\nwas not an option.\n\n\nAs a result the Committee took an unbiased approach and conducted a thorough evaluation of all\nmentions of \"LGBTQ+\" in the three curriculums. They identified only 12 and 4 mentions in the\nAdopted and Revised State of Colorado Standards respectively out of a total of 414 Outcomes and\nExpectations. American Birthright had only 1 mention.\n\nUpon evaluation of these mentions in the 2022 Adopted State of Colorado Standards two patterns emerged:\n\n\n1. LGBTQ+ is never singled out as a unique stand-alone subject. Whenever the topic of\nLGBTQ+ is shown it is part of a larger list of other minority groups including African American Latino\nreligious minorities etc. For example the Fourth Grade Standard 1 shows a student outcome as\n\u201cDescribe both past and present interactions among the people and cultures in Colorado. For\nexample: African American Latino Asian American Hawaiian/Pacific Islander Indigenous Peoples\nLGBTQ+ and religious minorities.\u201d This format of listing the LGBTQ+ people group as part of a larger\nspecific list of minority communities remains consistent throughout all of the 2022 Adopted and\nRevised State of Colorado Social Studies Standards.\n2. LGBTQ+ is never presented as sexuality or gender education. It was determined by the Social\nStudies Curriculum Committee that all mentions of LGBTQ+ were only recognition of the people group\nand were distinct from instruction on sexuality or gender characteristics of the LGBTQ+ group. In a\nsimilar sense the 2022 Adopted Colorado State Standards also show outcomes and expectations\nrecognizing the contributions and impact of religious minorities but do not mandate the religious\neducation of these groups. For example recognizing Jewish or Latter Day Saint people groups as part\nof the curriculum would be distinct from teaching the religious tenets of Judaism or Mormonism in the\nclassroom.\n\n\nIt is important to note that Tony May attempted to not allow the presentation and vote to take place at\nthe 10/25 Board Meeting by removing both from the agenda.\n\n\nFortunately other School Board members intervened against Tony May's actions ensuring that the\nSocial Studies Curriculum Committee was able to conclude the Garfield Re-2 School Board endorsed\nand facilitated process. The process aimed to evaluate our community values and determine the best\ncourse of action. Although the ultimate answer may not represent everyone's opinion throughout the\ncommunity the procedure was an inclusive objective operation that pursued consensus at every\nopportunity. Tony May worked against this process until the end driven by undisclosed personal\npreferences and undermined community input and buy-in as a result.\n\n\nTony May voted no against the committee recommendation of the 2022 Adopted State Standards.

Our shared mission is to prioritize student education by keeping the focus on their needs and\nwell-being free from the influence of politically divisive agendas. We are committed to aligning our district\npolicies with the Strategic Plan set by the district promoting representation and inclusion for our diverse\ncommunity and actively working to recruit and retain all staff members. Through our collaborative efforts we\naim to create an inclusive and effective educational environment that serves the best interests of our students\nparents and the community.\n\n\nCall to Action\n\n\nWith high hopes from the Garfield Re-2 Community and after 2 years in office Tony May has unfortunately\nbeen an unfit School Board President and Board Member. His conduct is bringing the School District to its\nfoundational limits and threatening our communities. Recalling Tony May will bring his conduct and actions\ninto democratic light for the betterment of the Garfield Re-2.\n\n\nObjective\n\n\nRespect.\n\n\nTransparency.\n\n\nCommunity.\n\n\nIn his attempt to implement a personal agenda Tony May has compromised the pillars of public office thereby\neroding the trust of the Garfield Re-2 Community in the School Board.\n\n\nRespect.\n\n\nTony May has repeatedly bullied intimidated and marginalized his fellow School Board Members\nGarfield Re-2 Staff Parents and Community Members. His actions have driven multiple School\nBoard members to resign and staff members currently live in fear of reprimand and retaliation\nmaking it difficult for them to carry out their duties effectively. Additionally Tony May has shown a lack\nof respect for speakers and employees by purposely mispronouncing their names and belittling the\ntopics presented. Regardless of political affiliation or worldview this behavior is unbecoming of any\npublic official especially a local School Board Member and is intolerable.\n\nTransparency.\n\n\nTony May's actions as School Board President and Board Member have been very concerning to the\nGarfield Re-2 Community. He has deliberately hid and concealed his efforts to unilaterally push his\npersonal preferences on the community which have been hidden from various stakeholders\nincluding Garfield Re-2 Staff other School Board Members the Press and the Community at Large.\nDespite being pressed repeatedly he has declined to comment publicly on topics of utmost concern\nto the community. Only after Colorado Open Records Act requests were initiated did his true\ncommunications get revealed. These communications have shown extensive and in-depth\nconversations with politically motivated actors who live far from the Garfield Re-2 School District. This\nlack of transparency is unacceptable for any democratically elected official and must be corrected\nimmediately.\n\n\nCommunity. Tony May has abused his administrative role as School Board President to attempt to\nsilence district-facilitated community input. Additionally he has utilized his voting interest to ignore\nthis same community input without any justification. Tony May has manipulated established Garfield\nRe-2 policies that ensure inclusion and buy-in of the larger Community. Additionally Tony has\ndeflected and attempted to confuse the public on critical School District functions for the\nadvancement of his personal agenda. This disregard of community input only undermines its stake in\nthe School District as an institution as well as undermining the greater democratic values our society\nholds most dear.\n\n\n____________________________________________________________\n\n\nRegarding American Birthright Standard\n\n\nRegarding LGBTQ+\n\n\nDuring the Social Studies Curriculum Review Process numerous members of the Garfield Re-2\ncommunity expressed their concern over how the topic of LGBTQ+ is presented in our schools.

It can be particularly useful for streamlining the process of selecting a design for a website by providing suggestions that align with the user's content and aesthetic goals.\n\nThe Website Builder plugin, on the other hand, is designed to assist users in creating one-page websites or landing pages. It provides a framework for building a webpage by allowing users to select and customize various blocks, such as text, images, and other elements, to create a cohesive and functional landing page. This plugin can be especially helpful for users who need to quickly set up a web presence without extensive web development experience.\n\nBoth plugins aim to simplify the web design process, making it more accessible and efficient for users to establish their online presence."

                            "here is the text we will include, it answers some of these questions :\n\nRecall Tony May Messaging Document\n \nMission Statement\nWe are a bipartisan community-rooted group dedicated to fostering accountability within the Garfield RE-2 School Board. Our shared mission is to prioritize student education by keeping the focus on their needs and well-being, free from the influence of politically divisive agendas. We are committed to aligning our district policies with the Strategic Plan set by the district, promoting representation and inclusion for our diverse community, and actively working to recruit and retain all staff members. Through our collaborative efforts, we aim to create an inclusive and effective educational environment that serves the best interests of our students, parents, and the community.\n \nCall to Action\nWith high hopes from the Garfield Re-2 Community and after 2 years in office, Tony May has unfortunately been an unfit School Board President and Board Member.  His conduct is bringing the School District to its foundational limits and threatening our communities.  Recalling Tony May will bring his conduct and actions into democratic light for the betterment of the Garfield Re-2.\n \nObjective\nRespect.\nTransparency.\nCommunity.\n \nIn his attempt to implement a personal agenda, Tony May has compromised the pillars of public office, thereby eroding the trust of the Garfield Re-2 Community in the School Board.\n \nRespect. \nTony May has repeatedly bullied, intimidated, and marginalized his fellow School Board Members, Garfield Re-2 Staff, Parents, and Community Members. His actions have driven multiple School Board members to resign, and staff members currently live in fear of reprimand and retaliation, making it difficult for them to carry out their duties effectively. Additionally, Tony May has shown a lack of respect for speakers and employees by purposely mispronouncing their names and belittling the topics presented. Regardless of political affiliation or worldview, this behavior is unbecoming of any public official, especially a local School Board Member, and is intolerable.\n \nTransparency. \nTony May's actions as School Board President and Board Member have been very concerning to the Garfield Re-2 Community. He has deliberately hid and concealed his efforts to unilaterally push his personal preferences on the community, which have been hidden from various stakeholders, including Garfield Re-2 Staff, other School Board Members, the Press, and the Community at Large. Despite being pressed repeatedly, he has declined to comment publicly on topics of utmost concern to the community. Only after Colorado Open Records Act requests were initiated, did his true communications get revealed. These communications have shown extensive and in-depth conversations with politically motivated actors who live far from the Garfield Re-2 School District. This lack of transparency is unacceptable for any democratically elected official and must be corrected immediately.\n \nCommunity.  Tony May has abused his administrative role as School Board President to attempt to silence district-facilitated community input.  Additionally, he has utilized his voting interest to ignore this same community input without any justification.  Tony May has manipulated established Garfield Re-2 policies that ensure inclusion and buy-in of the larger Community.  Additionally, Tony has deflected and attempted to confuse the public on critical School District functions for the advancement of his personal agenda.  This disregard of community input only undermines its stake in the School District as an institution as well as undermining the greater democratic values our society holds most dear.\n \n____________________________________________________________\n \nRegarding American Birthright Standard\n \nRegarding LGBTQ+   \nDuring the Social Studies Curriculum Review Process, numerous members of the Garfield Re-2 community expressed their concern over how the topic of LGBTQ+ is presented in our schools. The Social Studies Committee reviewed hundreds of comments and concluded that avoiding the subject was not an option.\n\n As a result, the Committee took an unbiased approach and conducted a thorough evaluation of all mentions of \"LGBTQ+\" in the three curriculums. They identified only 12 and 4 mentions in the Adopted and Revised State of Colorado Standards, respectively, out of a total of 414 Outcomes and Expectations. American Birthright had only 1 mention.\n \nUpon evaluation of these mentions in the 2022 Adopted State of Colorado Standards two patterns emerged:\n \nLGBTQ+ is never singled out as a unique, stand-alone subject.  Whenever the topic of LGBTQ+ is shown it is part of a larger list of other minority groups including African American, Latino, religious minorities, etc.  For example, the Fourth Grade Standard 1, shows a student outcome as \u201cDescribe both past and present interactions among the people and cultures in Colorado.  For example: African American, Latino, Asian American, Hawaiian/Pacific Islander, Indigenous Peoples, LGBTQ+, and religious minorities.\u201d  This format of listing the LGBTQ+ people group as part of a larger, specific list of minority communities remains consistent throughout all of the 2022 Adopted and Revised State of Colorado Social Studies Standards. \nLGBTQ+ is never presented as sexuality or gender education.  It was determined by the Social Studies Curriculum Committee that all mentions of LGBTQ+ were only recognition of the people group and were distinct from instruction on sexuality or gender characteristics of the LGBTQ+ group.  In a similar sense, the 2022 Adopted Colorado State Standards also show outcomes and expectations recognizing the contributions and impact of religious minorities but do not mandate the religious education of these groups.  For example, recognizing Jewish or Latter Day Saint people groups as part of the curriculum would be distinct from teaching the religious tenets of Judaism or Mormonism in the classroom.\n \n \nIt is important to note that Tony May attempted to not allow the presentation and vote to take place at the 10/25 Board Meeting by removing both from the agenda.\n \nFortunately, other School Board members intervened against Tony May's actions, ensuring that the Social Studies Curriculum Committee was able to conclude the Garfield Re-2 School Board endorsed and facilitated process. The process aimed to evaluate our community values and determine the best course of action. Although the ultimate answer may not represent everyone's opinion throughout the community, the procedure was an inclusive, objective operation that pursued consensus at every opportunity. Tony May worked against this process until the end, driven by undisclosed personal preferences, and undermined community input and buy-in as a result.\n \nTony May voted no against the committee recommendation of the 2022 Adopted State Standards. He also voted no on the 2022 Revised State Standards, showing that he would not accept anything other than American Birthright Standards, his personal agenda that does not align with the diverse range of perspectives and beliefs in our community regarding this topic.\n \nWith the help of the rest of the current board we were able to put the standards portion to bed, but as Tony May said at the end of the 10/25 meeting \u2013 This is not over.\n \nWe must stay vigilant to ensure that Tony May does not convince the newcomers to the board to make radical changes to the district while we are in our recall process. \n"

At the meeting, community protest prompted other board members to overrule him and reinstate the agenda item.\nL127: \nL128: Before voting, the board listened to public comment and a presentation from a standards review committee, both of which were overwhelmingly against ABS. Over 100 community members attended the meeting, according to a release from the West Garfield Education Association. Of 31 speakers, 30 were against the implementation of the alternative standards.\nL129: \nL130: In the heated public comment, many speakers were concerned about the impacts ABS would have on the quality of their children's education.\nL131: \nL132: \"This is also what the American Birthright Standards would do - teach our children to absorb and regurgitate information and repeat partisan messaging points,\" a New Castle parent said. \"It will fail our children and gut our school district.\"\nL133: \nL134: Others emphasized that the majority of the community opposed ABS.\nL135: \nL136: \"You have brought us together, Director May, by inciting this outlandish, political conversation, people from across the spectrum are now united in our community,\" one Rifle parent said. \"I want to walk my kids to school every morning...but I also want to know that where they're going is a place that's full of inclusion and love and support for all members of our community.\"\nL137: \nL138: \"The majority of people are asking for diversity, for inclusion, for equity, for teaching children the actual facts,\" another community member said. \"It is your duty to represent the community, not your own agenda.\"\nL139: \nL140: Many argued that adopting ABS would harm teacher retention in a district that was already facing staffing shortages. According to the Garfield Re-2 employment page, the district is seeking to fill 42 open positions already. \nL141: \nL142: The Re-2 district had the option to adopt one of three social studies curriculums, which included the 2022 Adopted Social Studies Standards, the Revised 2022 Social Studies Standards or ABS.\nL143: \nL144: Members of the standards review committee told the board that in a ranked choice vote, no one picked ABS as their first choice.\nL145: \nL146: ABS was rejected by the Colorado Board of Education in October 2022.\nL147: \nL148: The decision in Garfield means Woodland Park remains the only school board in Colorado to have adopted ABS.

However, Board President Tony May pulled the discussion item from the agenda after learning a local committee was going to recommend the board instead adopt the state social studies standards. Pulling the item from the agenda enraged community members who packed the boardroom Wednesday night. \nL52: \nL53: Twenty-nine speakers spoke in support \u2014 two did not \u2014 of the state-adopted standards. One called the Birthright standards \u201creligiously and politically charged,\u201d and many spoke of their fatigue over political battles at school board meetings.\nL54: \nL55: \u201cOver the last year I\u2019ve watched the priorities change from doing whatever it takes to help every child to fighting meaningless culture wars and pushing radical agendas that do not benefit or even reflect the interests and needs of the community,\u201d said Celeste Kratzer, who grew up in Rifle and now teaches at Rifle Middle School.\nL56: \nL57: ### Residents of different backgrounds came together\nL58: \nL59: But what most struck community members was how a social studies review committee composed of residents from different political and economic backgrounds, faiths and beliefs agreed on recommendations for the board.\nL60: \nL61: Garfield County is a conservative county on the Western Slope, and the school district student body is more than half Latino. \nL62: \nL63: \u201cEveryone came together to hash it out, to really figure out what the community of this district really wanted,\u201d said Jay Puidokas during the comment period. \u201cAnd it was extremely eye-opening to see the values align.\u201d \nL64: \nL65: State law requires each school district to host a local forum about the new social studies standards. Garfield chose to create a 59-person committee to review how well three sets of standards \u2014 the adopted state social studies standards, revised state standards, and the American Birthright standards \u2014 aligned with several Colorado laws and how well the standards aligned to community values.\nL66: \nL67: \u201cOur entire goal has been to work collaboratively with the school board and with our community to understand what the community values are,\u201d said Jacob Pringle, secondary school curriculum director.\nL68: \nL69: [Image 4]Garfield County School District Garfield County School District RE-2 board president Tony May at a meeting over the district's social studies standards.\nL70: \nL71: In the end, 83 percent of the committee members decided that the state-adopted standards best aligned with law and the community\u2019s core values.\nL72: \nL73: \u201cYou have brought us together Director May, by inciting this outlandish political conversation. People from across the spectrum are now united in our community,\u201d Angela Strode of Rifle told the board. \nL74: \nL75: She said the board needs to move on to other issues such as a school staff shortage. \nL76: \nL77: \u201cWe need to harness the energy behind me to start fixing the problems in our schools.\u201d\nL78: \nL79: After hours of testimony, the board majority voted to move forward on the social studies standards.\nL80: \nL81: ### The issue roiled the community for months\nL82: \nL83: Last year the state board of education passed \u301019\u2020new social studies standards\u3011 to align with several state laws. The most controversial called for social studies standards to reflect the history, cultures and social contributions of diverse peoples. The law names specific groups: African American, Latino, American Indian, Asian Americans, and LGBTQ people. \nL84: \nL85: Some Garfield board members pushed back on the state\u2019s adopted standards. \nL86: \nL87: But the community, alarmed that the option could be the American Birthright standards, began to rally. Several parents said they were afraid the district was going down the same path as the Woodland Park school district, where a conservative board adopted Birthright standards and instituted several dramatic changes, including the elimination of many mental health counselors and social worker positions. An estimated forty percent of school staff left Woodland Park last year.\nL88: \nL89: \u201cWe don\u2019t want our community to be torn apart like Woodland Park, where vocal ideologues took over the school board, causing chaos where there used to be peace,\u201d Willow Brotzman, a parent with two students in the RE-2 District, said in a press release issued Thursday after the vote. \nL90: \nL91: District leaders in Garfield led an exhaustive community review process that involved public surveys, community and staff meetings as well as a social studies curriculum committee to identify the core values the community wanted to see embedded in the social studies standards, such as students becoming independent problem solvers and being a critical thinker.\nL92: \nL93: Still, despite many in the community backing state standards, curriculum leaders said there is wariness among some in the community around LGBTQ topics in school. \nL94: \nL95: \u201cIf a 4th grade student asks what LGBTQ is,\u201d asked board member Jason Shoup, \u201cis that instructor obligated to get that in-depth? Or in the (district) training (for state adopted standards), does it give avenues of an out?\u201d\nL96: \nL97: Simone Richardson, elementary curriculum director, gave an example of how such an issue might arise according to state-adopted standards: a teacher is reading a book about mom and dad taking their children to the zoo. If a child raises his hand and says, \u201cI have two dads who took me to the zoo!\u201d the teacher acknowledges the child and moves on, she said.\nL98: \nL99: \u201cMuch of training would be around how does a family carry out those conversations and not an educator,\u201d said Richardson, meaning teachers could encourage students with more questions to ask their parents.\nL100: \nL101: Pringle, the secondary school curriculum director, said training for teachers prior to the implementation of new standards would consist of age-appropriate responses. \nL102: \nL103: District officials will now make sure the curriculum aligns to the state-adopted standards. Garfield RE-2 has three open seats on the school board this election. \nL104: \nL105: ### \nL106: \nL107: ### You care.\nL108: \nL109: You want to know what is really going on these days, especially in Colorado.

However, Board President Tony May pulled the discussion item from the agenda after learning a local committee was going to recommend the board instead adopt the state social studies standards. Pulling the item from the agenda enraged community members who packed the boardroom Wednesday night. \nL52: \nL53: Twenty-nine speakers spoke in support \u2014 two did not \u2014 of the state-adopted standards. One called the Birthright standards \u201creligiously and politically charged,\u201d and many spoke of their fatigue over political battles at school board meetings.\nL54: \nL55: \u201cOver the last year I\u2019ve watched the priorities change from doing whatever it takes to help every child to fighting meaningless culture wars and pushing radical agendas that do not benefit or even reflect the interests and needs of the community,\u201d said Celeste Kratzer, who grew up in Rifle and now teaches at Rifle Middle School.\nL56: \nL57: ### Residents of different backgrounds came together\nL58: \nL59: But what most struck community members was how a social studies review committee composed of residents from different political and economic backgrounds, faiths and beliefs agreed on recommendations for the board.\nL60: \nL61: Garfield County is a conservative county on the Western Slope, and the school district student body is more than half Latino. \nL62: \nL63: \u201cEveryone came together to hash it out, to really figure out what the community of this district really wanted,\u201d said Jay Puidokas during the comment period. \u201cAnd it was extremely eye-opening to see the values align.\u201d \nL64: \nL65: State law requires each school district to host a local forum about the new social studies standards. Garfield chose to create a 59-person committee to review how well three sets of standards \u2014 the adopted state social studies standards, revised state standards, and the American Birthright standards \u2014 aligned with several Colorado laws and how well the standards aligned to community values.\nL66: \nL67: \u201cOur entire goal has been to work collaboratively with the school board and with our community to understand what the community values are,\u201d said Jacob Pringle, secondary school curriculum director.\nL68: \nL69: [Image 4]Garfield County School District Garfield County School District RE-2 board president Tony May at a meeting over the district's social studies standards.\nL70: \nL71: In the end, 83 percent of the committee members decided that the state-adopted standards best aligned with law and the community\u2019s core values.\nL72: \nL73: \u201cYou have brought us together Director May, by inciting this outlandish political conversation. People from across the spectrum are now united in our community,\u201d Angela Strode of Rifle told the board. \nL74: \nL75: She said the board needs to move on to other issues such as a school staff shortage. \nL76: \nL77: \u201cWe need to harness the energy behind me to start fixing the problems in our schools.\u201d\nL78: \nL79: After hours of testimony, the board majority voted to move forward on the social studies standards.\nL80: \nL81: ### The issue roiled the community for months\nL82: \nL83: Last year the state board of education passed new social studies standards to align with several state laws. The most controversial called for social studies standards to reflect the history, cultures and social contributions of diverse peoples. The law names specific groups: African American, Latino, American Indian, Asian Americans, and LGBTQ people. \nL84: \nL85: Some Garfield board members pushed back on the state\u2019s adopted standards. \nL86: \nL87: But the community, alarmed that the option could be the American Birthright standards, began to rally. Several parents said they were afraid the district was going down the same path as the Woodland Park school district, where a conservative board adopted Birthright standards and instituted several dramatic changes, including the elimination of many mental health counselors and social worker positions. An estimated forty percent of school staff left Woodland Park last year.\nL88: \nL89: \u201cWe don\u2019t want our community to be torn apart like Woodland Park, where vocal ideologues took over the school board, causing chaos where there used to be peace,\u201d Willow Brotzman, a parent with two students in the RE-2 District, said in a press release issued Thursday after the vote. \nL90: \nL91: District leaders in Garfield led an exhaustive community review process that involved public surveys, community and staff meetings as well as a social studies curriculum committee to identify the core values the community wanted to see embedded in the social studies standards, such as students becoming independent problem solvers and being a critical thinker.\nL92: \nL93: Still, despite many in the community backing state standards, curriculum leaders said there is wariness among some in the community around LGBTQ topics in school. \nL94: \nL95: \u201cIf a 4th grade student asks what LGBTQ is,\u201d asked board member Jason Shoup, \u201cis that instructor obligated to get that in-depth? Or in the (district) training (for state adopted standards), does it give avenues of an out?\u201d\nL96: \nL97: Simone Richardson, elementary curriculum director, gave an example of how such an issue might arise according to state-adopted standards: a teacher is reading a book about mom and dad taking their children to the zoo. If a child raises his hand and says, \u201cI have two dads who took me to the zoo!\u201d the teacher acknowledges the child and moves on, she said.\nL98: \nL99: \u201cMuch of training would be around how does a family carry out those conversations and not an educator,\u201d said Richardson, meaning teachers could encourage students with more questions to ask their parents.\nL100: \nL101: Pringle, the secondary school curriculum director, said training for teachers prior to the implementation of new standards would consist of age-appropriate responses. \nL102: \nL103: District officials will now make sure the curriculum aligns to the state-adopted standards. Garfield RE-2 has three open seats on the school board this election. \nL104: \nL105: ### \nL106: \nL107: ### You care.\nL108: \nL109: You want to know what is really going on these days, especially in Colorado.

Education journalist Erica Meltzer of Chalkbeat Colorado has covered the issue in detail as some schools are considering the standards.\nL212: \nL213: KDNK Reporter Hattison Rensberry interviewed Meltzer, and asked her about the basics of the American Birthright Standards, and why they can be controversial.\nL214: \nL215: \"Meltzer: The American Birthright Standards were developed in response to a number of trends in civics and social studies education. These include efforts to make social studies instruction more inclusive, to tie civics education more to some of the equity and social justice movements that are happening. And this is something that goes back more than a decade, sort of some developing trends within social studies education.\nL216: \nL217: And, you know, frankly, I'm, I'm 45 and there's a lot of things that are really important in American history that I didn't learn in school, that, that my kids are learning in school, but I think there's also people who are concerned that bringing in these more diverse narratives. starts to paint a negative view of the United States that it undermines our unity as a nation.\nL218: \nL219: And so there's been a push to correct that and to put out standards and curriculum that reflect the idea that sort of a sort of a heroic story of the United States. They're controversial partly because the story of our history is always going to be a contested ground. They're also controversial because a number of the people who are involved in putting them together are fairly open about their conservative politics.\nL220: \nL221: And the National Council for Social Studies is the, the big national organization for social studies teachers has said that they, they don't think these standards reflect an accurate or complete view of American history.\nL222: \nL223: Rensberry: Would you say that there are certain regions in the U. S. that are leaning more towards looking at these standards as an option?\nL224: \nL225: Meltzer: I mean, I think places where conservative political views are more dominant have been more likely to adopt these\nL226: \nL227: Rensberry: standards. When going through the website for this set of standards, it's noted on there that they have some partners in various states, about ten, that are encouraging the use of these suggested curriculums, but I don't see any states taking on this particular set of standards.\nL228: \nL229: What have you seen in regards to that and what kinds of partners are these?\nL230: \nL231: Meltzer: For example, the Colorado affiliate that they list is the Independence Institute, which presents itself as a libertarian think tank. They have a lot of overlap with, with what people would consider as conservative political ideas.\nL232: \nL233: The Independence Institute was very active in opposing the revised Colorado social studies standards, which were adopted last year and were controversial in some parts of the state for their emphasis on a more inclusive approach to social studies standards. We also see that, for example, a number of scholars involved in developing the American birthright curriculum come from Hillsdale College, and Hillsdale College is a Christian college in Michigan that also provides curriculum to a lot of classical academy charter schools, which provide what they present as a more traditional education.\nL234: \nL235: And so these are some of the places that, that you would see these ideas. promoted or supported. Of course, Woodland Park became the first school district in Colorado to adopt the American Birthright Social Studies and Civic Standards as their own. And now Garfield, RE2, is considering adopting them. And we've seen this emerge in Colorado as a bit of a backlash to those state standards.\nL236: \nL237: It was a divided vote in the State Board of Education. In many of the more conservative parts of the state that were opposed to these new social studies standards. And so we see school districts sort of going their own way with these standards that they feel are more aligned to their political values.\nL238: \nL239: Rensberry: Sure. Yeah, that vote was pretty close. When you talk about sort of these more traditional school standards for social studies, what sort of things are included in those\nL240: \nL241: Meltzer: standards? The overall view you will get is, is a more heroic story of the American nation. For example, um, if you look at the state social studies standards, there was a really big emphasis this time around on a more inclusive narrative on including more voices and more perspectives, and that means bringing in groups that were historically more marginalized.\nL242: \nL243: And maybe have not had a good experience always in this country. Maybe they have had experiences of oppression, of slavery, of discrimination. Whereas the American birthright standard,\nVisible: 33% - 86%",

Education journalist Erica Meltzer of Chalkbeat Colorado has covered the issue in detail as some schools are considering the standards.\nL212: \nL213: KDNK Reporter Hattison Rensberry interviewed Meltzer, and asked her about the basics of the American Birthright Standards, and why they can be controversial.\nL214: \nL215: \"Meltzer: The American Birthright Standards were developed in response to a number of trends in civics and social studies education. These include efforts to make social studies instruction more inclusive, to tie civics education more to some of the equity and social justice movements that are happening. And this is something that goes back more than a decade, sort of some developing trends within social studies education.\nL216: \nL217: And, you know, frankly, I'm, I'm 45 and there's a lot of things that are really important in American history that I didn't learn in school, that, that my kids are learning in school, but I think there's also people who are concerned that bringing in these more diverse narratives. starts to paint a negative view of the United States that it undermines our unity as a nation.\nL218: \nL219: And so there's been a push to correct that and to put out standards and curriculum that reflect the idea that sort of a sort of a heroic story of the United States. They're controversial partly because the story of our history is always going to be a contested ground. They're also controversial because a number of the people who are involved in putting them together are fairly open about their conservative politics.\nL220: \nL221: And the National Council for Social Studies is the, the big national organization for social studies teachers has said that they, they don't think these standards reflect an accurate or complete view of American history.\nL222: \nL223: Rensberry: Would you say that there are certain regions in the U. S. that are leaning more towards looking at these standards as an option?\nL224: \nL225: Meltzer: I mean, I think places where conservative political views are more dominant have been more likely to adopt these\nL226: \nL227: Rensberry: standards. When going through the website for this set of standards, it's noted on there that they have some partners in various states, about ten, that are encouraging the use of these suggested curriculums, but I don't see any states taking on this particular set of standards.\nL228: \nL229: What have you seen in regards to that and what kinds of partners are these?\nL230: \nL231: Meltzer: For example, the Colorado affiliate that they list is the Independence Institute, which presents itself as a libertarian think tank. They have a lot of overlap with, with what people would consider as conservative political ideas.\nL232: \nL233: The Independence Institute was very active in opposing the revised Colorado social studies standards, which were adopted last year and were controversial in some parts of the state for their emphasis on a more inclusive approach to social studies standards. We also see that, for example, a number of scholars involved in developing the American birthright curriculum come from Hillsdale College, and Hillsdale College is a Christian college in Michigan that also provides curriculum to a lot of classical academy charter schools, which provide what they present as a more traditional education.\nL234: \nL235: And so these are some of the places that, that you would see these ideas. promoted or supported. Of course, Woodland Park became the first school district in Colorado to adopt the American Birthright Social Studies and Civic Standards as their own. And now Garfield, RE2, is considering adopting them. And we've seen this emerge in Colorado as a bit of a backlash to those state standards.\nL236: \nL237: It was a divided vote in the State Board of Education. In many of the more conservative parts of the state that were opposed to these new social studies standards. And so we see school districts sort of going their own way with these standards that they feel are more aligned to their political values.\nL238: \nL239: Rensberry: Sure. Yeah, that vote was pretty close. When you talk about sort of these more traditional school standards for social studies, what sort of things are included in those\nL240: \nL241: Meltzer: standards? The overall view you will get is, is a more heroic story of the American nation. For example, um, if you look at the state social studies standards, there was a really big emphasis this time around on a more inclusive narrative on including more voices and more perspectives, and that means bringing in groups that were historically more marginalized.\nL242: \nL243: And maybe have not had a good experience always in this country. Maybe they have had experiences of oppression, of slavery, of discrimination. Whereas the American birthright standard,\nVisible: 33% - 86%",

Davis\u3011 \nL53: \nL54: posted on\nL55: \nL56: October 6, 2023\nL57: \nL58: The most important school board races in Colorado this year are not on the Front Range, and are rarely in the press. They are tucked into high valleys beyond the curtains of peaks, attracting little notice and even less money. While school board races in Denver routinely attract tens of thousands of voters and \u301013\u2020millions of dollars\u2020co.chalkbeat.org\u3011 in outside spending, the races carrying the real stakes of the November elections could be decided by dozens of votes, or a few thousand dollars. Rural school board races have never been as important as they are this year, and their ramifications could be felt statewide.\nL59: \nL60: Those without school-age children may have missed much of the drama of the past two years, in which school politics have taken on national weight and interest. In Florida, Gov. Ron DeSantis built a national platform for himself by cracking down on queer students and teachers with his \u201cDon\u2019t Say Gay\u201d bill, seizing control of Florida\u2019s celebrated liberal arts university, and defending a curriculum that teaches students about the supposed upsides of slavery. In Virginia, Gov. Glenn Youngkin rode to office in 2021 on a wave of concerns about \u201cCritical Race Theory\u201d and diversity, equity, and inclusion policies in schools. The movement the two governors are both fueling and appeasing unites under the umbrella of \u201cparents\u2019 rights,\u201d and in the past two years, that movement has spread like wildfire. This November, communities across the country will vote for school board directors for the first time since the parents\u2019 rights movement came into full bloom. In districts around the country, candidates backed by parents\u2019 rights groups like Moms for Liberty are running on explicitly anti-LGBTQ platforms, promising to deliver less-inclusive learning environments wherever they win.\nL61: \nL62: In Colorado, the stakes are particularly high. Centennial State school districts are facing the same onslaught of intolerance seen in districts around the country \u2014 in the past few weeks, the Colorado Times Recorder has covered flare-ups in \u301014\u2020Cherry Creek\u3011, \u301015\u2020Colorado Springs\u3011, and \u301016\u2020Larimer County\u3011 \u2014 but they are also facing something else: a Colorado-specific playbook designed to maximize conservative control of school boards, and then use those boards to wage an assault on the public education system from the inside.\nL63: \nL64: For the past two years, that playbook has been hammered-out in Woodland Park, a small town about 30 minutes northwest of Colorado Springs, where a conservative board majority won power in 2021. Under the guidance of two long-time conservative education warriors, \u301017\u2020attorney Brad Miller and now-superintendent Ken Witt\u3011, the Woodland Park school board has waged an all-out assault on the local teachers\u2019 union, \u301018\u2020removed books by diverse authors\u2020gazette.com\u3011 from curriculum, fired or dismissed a \u301019\u2020huge number\u3011 of long-time district administrators, \u301020\u2020placed a gag order on district employees\u2020www.cpr.org\u3011, and adopted a controversial new social studies curriculum: \u301021\u2020American Birthright\u3011. Far from being a scattershot approach to delivering on conservative wishlist items, the aggressive course of action undertaken by the Woodland Park School Board has been a calculated maneuver to expand the authority of local school boards by exploiting weaknesses in state law \u2013 this according to secretly recorded audio of attorney Brad Miller, \u301022\u2020which I obtained\u3011.\nL65: \nL66: In the audio, recorded during a presentation Miller participated in at a conference held this summer by the far-right Freedom Foundation, Miller discussed how his conservative school board clients can thwart the State Board of Education and Democratic-controlled legislature which oversee education standards in Colorado; how they can expand their own authority by taking advantage of weaknesses in the system.\nL67: \nL68: \u201cIn Colorado, the state is so blue that the decisions made at [the state] level in the state board and in the legislature are going to be contrary to what my clients want,\u201d Miller can be heard saying on the audio. The trick, he suggests, is to call the state\u2019s bluff.\nL69: \nL70: \u201cThe state board rejected the American Birthright standards,\u201d Miller said, referring to the only body in Colorado with the authority to set education standards. \u201cIn Woodland Park, we adopted it and said, \u2018tell them to try to stop us.\u2019\u201d\nL71: \nL72: So far, no one has tried to stop them.\nL73: \nL74: This, more than anything else, seems to be the motive behind the Woodland Park experiment, and the motive behind expanding that experiment to districts around the state this November: to push the envelope and see who pushes back, and then to push it some more. Next month, it is very likely that a handful of Colorado school districts will be placed in the hands of directors who want to push this strategy and accelerate the unraveling of a uniform, statewide public education.\nL75: \nL76: In recent weeks, I\u2019ve spoken to candidates and community members in another school district staring down the barrel of a potential Woodland-Park-style transformation. It is just one district of nearly 200 in the state, but an electoral win there would represent the first successful exportation of the Woodland Park playbook, and a new veneer of viability for the strategy to remake public education.\nL77: \nL78: * * *\nL79: \nL80: Of the 178 school districts in Colorado, none seem more eager to follow at the heels of Woodland Park than Garfield Re-2. Stretching along I-70 between New Castle, Silt, and Rifle at the mouth of the Roaring Fork Valley, Garfield Re-2 is a small, diverse district that is not at all reflective of its most famous inhabitant, Congresswoman Lauren Boebert. According to Colorado Department of Education \u301023\u2020statistics\u2020www.cde.state.co.us\u3011, the district is majority-minority, with 57% of the student body being Hispanic or Latino. \nL81: \nL82: The local school board does not reflect the district\u2019s diversity \u2013 the five-member panel is all white. In recent months, the board has started pushing an aggressive conservative agenda at odds with much of the district\u2019s working-class and minority population. \nL83: \nL84: [Image 6]Source: Garfield County Re-2 website\nL85: \nL86: On the surface, the district has little in common with Woodland Park \u2013 a predominantly white and relatively affluent area \u2013 but striking similarities between the two districts\u2019 governance started emerging earlier this year.\nL87: \nL88: At a May 10 meeting of the Garfield Re-2 school board, Board President Tony May presented a resolution objecting to \u301024\u2020legislation\u2020leg.colorado.gov\u3011 designed to help students access mental health services. Opposition to in-school mental health services is a \u301025\u2020growing priority\u2020www.npr.org\u3011 within the broader parents\u2019 rights movement where \u201csocial-emotional learning\u201d or SEL \u2013 which, in reality, is \u301026\u2020simply the development of social skills\u2020www.vox.com\u3011 \u2013 has been framed as a \u201cTrojan horse for both critical race theory and transgender advocacy.\u201d\nL89: \nL90: \u201cThe Supreme Court has repeatedly held the right of parents to control and direct the education and upbringing of their own child to be\nVisible: 0% - 33%",

(KUSA) \u2014 A bill to help students get access to mental health help might not seem especially controversial, but some districts in Colorado say it is.\nL139: \nL140: Before a new law was signed Monday giving schools the option to participate in a program giving students mental health screenings, a handful of rural, conservative school districts banded together to say they would opt out.\nL141: \nL142: House Bill 1003 creates a school mental health assessment. Students from 6th to 12th grade will be screened and referred to a therapist if needed. The bill was signed into law on Monday by Democratic Governor Jared Polis.\nL143: \nL144: \u201cMore children in need of services will be able to get those services,\u201d Polis said at the bill signing.\nL145: \nL146: When they refused to participate, all the school districts said the exact same thing, word for word.\nL147: \nL148: \u201cThe state is not in charge of the mental health of your children, my kids,\u201d said Woodland Park School Board President David Rusterholtz at a meeting on April 12.\nL149: \nL150: The bill\u2019s sponsor, Democratic representative Dafna Michaelson Jenet, said parents can opt out of the screenings for their kids. But, if a student is above the age of 12, they can opt back in without their parent\u2019s approval.\nL151: \nL152: \u201cIf they\u2019re going to confide in a therapist and then that therapist calls mom and dad at the end of the night, you\u2019re never going to have another therapy session,\u201d Michaelson Jenet said.\nL153: \nL154: Michaelson Jenet says the screenings are all confidential and protected by HIPPA. She likened them to an eye screening that some kids take at school to see if they need glasses.\nL155: \nL156: The program will expand upon the \u201cI Matter\u201d program that was started in 2021 to give students in Colorado free access to mental health care and therapists. It started after the pandemic hit and has already served more than 8,500 kids, according to Michaelson Jenet. The screenings will help refer students to the services offered by the I Matter program.\nL157: \nL158: \u201cHow can we find them and get them care as swiftly as possible?\u201d Michaelson Jenet said at the bill signing. \u201cThe I Matter Program is proof of that. We have served 8,500 kids in Colorado so far with the I Matter Program. We will serve more kids through that program via this bill.\u201d\nL159: \nL160: The goal seems simple: get more students more help. Getting everybody to agree on that is more difficult.\nL161: \nL162: Board members in Woodland Park and at least one other small, rural district read a resolution opposing the bill in the months leading up to the signing.\nL163: \nL164: \u201cThe Supreme Court has repeatedly held the right of parents to control and direct the education and upbringing of their own child to be a fundamental right protected under the Fourteenth Amendment,\u201d Rusterholtz said, reading the resolution.\nL165: \nL166: It sounds original, but it\u2019s not.\nL167: \nL168: Word for word, Garfield County Re-2 School Board Director Tony May read the exact same resolution at their meeting on May 10.\nL169: \nL170: \u201cThe Supreme Court has repeatedly held the right of parents to control and direct the education and upbringing of their own child to be a fundamental right protected under the Fourteenth Amendment,\u201d May read in-part.\nL171: \nL172: May told 9NEWS on the phone today that he didn\u2019t write it, he just read it. He said he didn\u2019t know who wrote the resolution shared from school board to school board opposing the bill that today became law.\nL173: \nL174: So the big question is, who wrote the resolution shared and copied by all these school districts?\nL175: \nL176: We don\u2019t know that yet, though we might have some clues. The Superintendent in Woodland Park is Ken Witt. He also runs a group called Education ReEnvisioned, which posted the exact resolution \u301054\u2020on their website.\u2020www.edreenvisioned.org\u3011 It\u2019s unclear if they wrote it or got it from an outside group and then shared it with conservative school boards around the state telling them to oppose the bill.\nL177: \nL178: Witt did not reply to a call and email from 9NEWS Monday afternoon.\nL179: \nL180: \u201cI absolutely believe that where they have already decided that they are not going to take part in this program, the people who suffer are the children,\u201d Michaelson Jenet said.\nL181: \nL182: At least these two school boards that we know of, Garfield County Re-2 and Woodland Park, have said they will opt out of the program. That means students in those districts won\u2019t get access to the mental health resources at school.

Following two tie votes, the board eventually decided by a vote of 3-1 to adopt the state standards over the politically charged ABS, which promotes radical patriotism and religion while denying the role of minorities and immigrants in the history of our nation.\nL75: \nL76: May cast the lone dissenting vote.\nL77: \nL78: Before voting, the board heard public comment and a presentation from a standards review committee made up of more than 50 community volunteers, all of whom overwhelmingly rejected ABS and the impacts it would have on their children\u2019s education.\nL79: \nL80: Voces Unidas took a leadership role in organizing opposition to the controversial ABS curriculum that was rejected by the Colorado Board of Education in October 2022, initiating a letter campaign resulting in some 65 emails sent directly to the four board members and gathering nearly 170 signatures on an online petition calling for the adoption of the state-approved social studies standards that emphasize diversity, equity and inclusion in the study of history.\nL81: \nL82: \u201cThis was a big win for sure,\u201d Regional Organizing Manager Alan Mu\u00f1oz said afterward. \u201cVoces Unidas had 10 local leaders at the meeting and three of them gave public comment, including Irene Wittrock, who testified in Spanish to let the school district know that we are here and the district needs to do a better job of making Latinos feel welcome and allowing us to have our voices heard.\u201d\nL83: \nL84: The student population in the Garfield RE-2 School District is about 55% Latino.\nL85: \nL86: After months of discussion, the Oct. 25 vote made it clear that an overwhelming majority of the community opposed the ABS being pushed by May, with commenters saying it would \u201cfail our children\u201d and reminding board members that \"it is your duty to represent the community, not your own agenda.\" Not a single member of the standards review committee ranked ABS as their top choice among the three options in a ranked choice vote.\nL87: \nL88: We\u2019re proud of our role in this victory and grateful to the Garfield RE-2 community for coming out to support education and diversity!\nL89: \nL90:   * \u301028\u2020Garfield RE-2\u3011\nL91:   * \u301029\u2020Education\u3011\nL92: \nL93:   * \u301027\u2020Action Fund\u3011\nL94:   * \u2022\nL95:   * \u301026\u2020Voces Unidas c3\u3011\nL96:   * \u2022\nL97:   * \u301019\u2020Advocacy\u3011\nL98: \nL99: 58 views \nL100: \nL101: Post not marked as liked \nL102: \nL103: ## Related Posts\nL104: \nL105: \u30107\u2020See All\u3011\nL106: \nL107: [Image 1]\nL108: \nL109: \u301030\u2020Voces Unidas calls on community to support group of 80 unhoused Latinos living under bridge\u3011\nL110: \nL111: 34 \nL112: \nL113: Post not marked as liked\nL114: \nL115: [Image 2]\nL116: \nL117: \u301031\u2020Summit School Board election is an investment in our community\u3011\nL118: \nL119: 23 \nL120: \nL121: Post not marked as liked\nL122: \nL123: [Image 3]\nL124: \nL125: \u301032\u2020Another painful reminder of need for action on gun violence, culturally responsive mental health\u3011\nL126: \nL127: 44 \nL128: \nL129: Post not marked as liked\nL130: \nL131: Mailing Address\nL132: \nL133: P.

Following two tie votes, the board eventually decided by a vote of 3-1 to adopt the state standards over the politically charged ABS, which promotes radical patriotism and religion while denying the role of minorities and immigrants in the history of our nation.\nL75: \nL76: May cast the lone dissenting vote.\nL77: \nL78: Before voting, the board heard public comment and a presentation from a standards review committee made up of more than 50 community volunteers, all of whom overwhelmingly rejected ABS and the impacts it would have on their children\u2019s education.\nL79: \nL80: Voces Unidas took a leadership role in organizing opposition to the controversial ABS curriculum that was rejected by the Colorado Board of Education in October 2022, initiating a letter campaign resulting in some 65 emails sent directly to the four board members and gathering nearly 170 signatures on an online petition calling for the adoption of the state-approved social studies standards that emphasize diversity, equity and inclusion in the study of history.\nL81: \nL82: \u201cThis was a big win for sure,\u201d Regional Organizing Manager Alan Mu\u00f1oz said afterward. \u201cVoces Unidas had 10 local leaders at the meeting and three of them gave public comment, including Irene Wittrock, who testified in Spanish to let the school district know that we are here and the district needs to do a better job of making Latinos feel welcome and allowing us to have our voices heard.\u201d\nL83: \nL84: The student population in the Garfield RE-2 School District is about 55% Latino.\nL85: \nL86: After months of discussion, the Oct. 25 vote made it clear that an overwhelming majority of the community opposed the ABS being pushed by May, with commenters saying it would \u201cfail our children\u201d and reminding board members that \"it is your duty to represent the community, not your own agenda.\" Not a single member of the standards review committee ranked ABS as their top choice among the three options in a ranked choice vote.\nL87: \nL88: We\u2019re proud of our role in this victory and grateful to the Garfield RE-2 community for coming out to support education and diversity!\nL89: \nL90:   * Garfield RE-2\nL91:   * Education\nL92: \nL93:   * Action Fund\nL94:   * \u2022\nL95:   * Voces Unidas c3\nL96:   * \u2022\nL97:   * Advocacy\nL98: \nL99: 58 views \nL100: \nL101: Post not marked as liked \nL102: \nL103: ## Related Posts\nL104: \nL105: See All\nL106: \nL107: [Image 1]\nL108: \nL109: Voces Unidas calls on community to support group of 80 unhoused Latinos living under bridge\nL110: \nL111: 34 \nL112: \nL113: Post not marked as liked\nL114: \nL115: [Image 2]\nL116: \nL117: Summit School Board election is an investment in our community\nL118: \nL119: 23 \nL120: \nL121: Post not marked as liked\nL122: \nL123: [Image 3]\nL124: \nL125: Another painful reminder of need for action on gun violence, culturally responsive mental health\nL126: \nL127: 44 \nL128: \nL129: Post not marked as liked\nL130: \nL131: Mailing Address\nL132: \nL133: P.

(KUSA) \u2014 A bill to help students get access to mental health help might not seem especially controversial, but some districts in Colorado say it is.\nL139: \nL140: Before a new law was signed Monday giving schools the option to participate in a program giving students mental health screenings, a handful of rural, conservative school districts banded together to say they would opt out.\nL141: \nL142: House Bill 1003 creates a school mental health assessment. Students from 6th to 12th grade will be screened and referred to a therapist if needed. The bill was signed into law on Monday by Democratic Governor Jared Polis.\nL143: \nL144: \u201cMore children in need of services will be able to get those services,\u201d Polis said at the bill signing.\nL145: \nL146: When they refused to participate, all the school districts said the exact same thing, word for word.\nL147: \nL148: \u201cThe state is not in charge of the mental health of your children, my kids,\u201d said Woodland Park School Board President David Rusterholtz at a meeting on April 12.\nL149: \nL150: The bill\u2019s sponsor, Democratic representative Dafna Michaelson Jenet, said parents can opt out of the screenings for their kids. But, if a student is above the age of 12, they can opt back in without their parent\u2019s approval.\nL151: \nL152: \u201cIf they\u2019re going to confide in a therapist and then that therapist calls mom and dad at the end of the night, you\u2019re never going to have another therapy session,\u201d Michaelson Jenet said.\nL153: \nL154: Michaelson Jenet says the screenings are all confidential and protected by HIPPA. She likened them to an eye screening that some kids take at school to see if they need glasses.\nL155: \nL156: The program will expand upon the \u201cI Matter\u201d program that was started in 2021 to give students in Colorado free access to mental health care and therapists. It started after the pandemic hit and has already served more than 8,500 kids, according to Michaelson Jenet. The screenings will help refer students to the services offered by the I Matter program.\nL157: \nL158: \u201cHow can we find them and get them care as swiftly as possible?\u201d Michaelson Jenet said at the bill signing. \u201cThe I Matter Program is proof of that. We have served 8,500 kids in Colorado so far with the I Matter Program. We will serve more kids through that program via this bill.\u201d\nL159: \nL160: The goal seems simple: get more students more help. Getting everybody to agree on that is more difficult.\nL161: \nL162: Board members in Woodland Park and at least one other small, rural district read a resolution opposing the bill in the months leading up to the signing.\nL163: \nL164: \u201cThe Supreme Court has repeatedly held the right of parents to control and direct the education and upbringing of their own child to be a fundamental right protected under the Fourteenth Amendment,\u201d Rusterholtz said, reading the resolution.\nL165: \nL166: It sounds original, but it\u2019s not.\nL167: \nL168: Word for word, Garfield County Re-2 School Board Director Tony May read the exact same resolution at their meeting on May 10.\nL169: \nL170: \u201cThe Supreme Court has repeatedly held the right of parents to control and direct the education and upbringing of their own child to be a fundamental right protected under the Fourteenth Amendment,\u201d May read in-part.\nL171: \nL172: May told 9NEWS on the phone today that he didn\u2019t write it, he just read it. He said he didn\u2019t know who wrote the resolution shared from school board to school board opposing the bill that today became law.\nL173: \nL174: So the big question is, who wrote the resolution shared and copied by all these school districts?\nL175: \nL176: We don\u2019t know that yet, though we might have some clues. The Superintendent in Woodland Park is Ken Witt. He also runs a group called Education ReEnvisioned, which posted the exact resolution \u301054\u2020on their website.\u2020www.edreenvisioned.org\u3011 It\u2019s unclear if they wrote it or got it from an outside group and then shared it with conservative school boards around the state telling them to oppose the bill.\nL177: \nL178: Witt did not reply to a call and email from 9NEWS Monday afternoon.\nL179: \nL180: \u201cI absolutely believe that where they have already decided that they are not going to take part in this program, the people who suffer are the children,\u201d Michaelson Jenet said.\nL181: \nL182: At least these two school boards that we know of, Garfield County Re-2 and Woodland Park, have said they will opt out of the program. That means students in those districts won\u2019t get access to the mental health resources at school. They can still apply online and get access to therapy help.\nL183: \nL184: \u201cI think all of that is\nVisible: 9% - 70%",

Here's an example with placeholder descriptions which you can replace with actual content that summarizes each link. I'll also include some inline CSS to give it a clean, modern look. You can adjust the CSS styles to match your site's design.\n\n```html\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: none; padding: 0;\">\n  <li style=\"margin-bottom: 10px;\">\n    <a href=\"https://cdnsm5-ss10.sharpschool.com/UserFiles/Servers/Server_20821459/File/Garfield%20Re-2%20Strategic%20Plan%20FINAL.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"text-decoration: none; color: #333;\">\n      <strong>Garfield Re-2 Strategic Plan (PDF)</strong>\n      <p style=\"margin: 0;\">Explore the comprehensive strategic plan of the Garfield Re-2 school district, outlining future goals and initiatives.</p>\n    </a>\n  </li>\n  <!-- Repeat the format for other links -->\n</ul>\n```\n\nFor a WordPress site, especially when using a page builder like Elementor, it may be more appropriate to use its built-in widgets and style controls rather than inline CSS. Elementor has a 'Text Editor' widget where you can paste HTML content, and you can style it using the widget\u2019s Style tab.\n\nHowever, if you prefer to have more control over the design by directly using HTML and CSS, you can use a 'HTML' widget and paste the code above. Adjust the styles such as `color`, `margin`, and `text-decoration` to match your site's design.\n\nIf you provide the actual descriptions for each link, I can include them in the formatted list."

The image should include a depiction of the sky transitioning into a serene Colorado River, flanked by the Rocky Mountains and mesas in the distance. On the riverbank, add a small group of silhouetted figures representing diverse descents such as Caucasian, Hispanic, Black, and South Asian, standing together in unity - some holding hands, others leaning on each other, in a show of support and community. These figures should be subtly included and not the main focus to ensure the website's text remains legible. The color palette should be warm and welcoming, with hues of browns, oranges, greens, and yellows. In the center of the composition, have the elements subtly merge into the silhouette of a book in the sky, symbolizing education. Near this central transition, include a 'Tree of Knowledge' with expansive branches.",

                            "GPT-4 Turbo represents an enhancement over the original GPT-4 model. It features an increased knowledge cutoff up to April 2023, enabling it to process and understand events and information up to that date. Additionally, GPT-4 Turbo has been designed with a larger context window of 128k tokens, equivalent to about 300 pages of text, which allows it to handle significantly more information in a single prompt than its predecessor\u30108\u2020source\u3011\u30109\u2020source\u3011\u301010\u2020source\u3011. This expanded capability makes it a more powerful tool for generating responses based on a wider range of input data. The model is also optimized for cost-efficiency, being three times cheaper for input tokens and twice as cheap for output tokens compared to the original GPT-4\u30108\u2020source\u3011. This makes it more accessible for various applications and users who require high-volume processing at lower costs."

This process is designed to improve the performance of .NET applications by performing tasks such as batch compilation of native images, which can be CPU-intensive but are typically performed during periods of idle time to minimize impact on system performance.\n\nWhen you notice `mscorsvw.exe` using a high amount of CPU, it usually means that it's actively compiling .NET assemblies. This can happen after an update to the .NET Framework or when a large number of new .NET applications have been installed on the system.\n\nTo manage or mitigate high CPU usage by `mscorsvw.exe`, you can:\n\n1. **Let it complete:** The easiest solution is to let `mscorsvw.exe` run its course. Once it finishes compiling the necessary assemblies, CPU usage should return to normal.\n\n2. **Force a completion:** If you want to complete all outstanding work immediately, you can use the `ngen.exe executequeueditems` command, which"

                            "The analysis of the firewall log has provided several insights:\n\n1. **Traffic Summary**:\n   - There are a total of 1,009 events logged.\n   - There are 12 unique source IP addresses and 46 unique destination IP addresses.\n   - A total of 321 unique source ports and 11 unique destination ports were observed.\n   - The firewall has taken two types of actions: `DROP` (616 times) and `ALLOW` (393 times).\n   - The majority of the traffic used UDP protocol (950 events), with some TCP traffic (55 events) and a small number (4 events) of protocol \"2\", which might be a mislogging or an unidentified protocol.\n\n2. **Common Port Activity**:\n   - No activity was detected on the common ports that are often associated with malicious traffic (e.g., 22, 23, 80, 443, 3389).\n\n3. **Repeated Drops**:\n   - Certain source IP addresses have been repeatedly dropped, with `169.254.100.1` being the most frequent, appearing 315 times. This IP address is a link-local address, which might indicate internal network traffic that is being blocked. Other link-local addresses (`fe80::/10` prefix) have also been dropped frequently.\n\n4. **Common Target Ports**:\n   - The most common destination ports that were targeted are 5353 (mDNS), 1900 (SSDP), and 53 (DNS). These are common ports that would see a lot of benign traffic in most networks; however, high volumes could also indicate scanning or DDoS attempts.\n\n5. **Large Packets**:\n   - No packets larger than 1500 bytes were observed, which suggests that there were no large payloads that might indicate exfiltration or certain types of attacks.\n\nGiven these observations, here are some considerations:\n- The high number of `DROP` actions, especially from link-local addresses, could indicate either misconfigured internal services or benign services that are being blocked by policy.\n- The frequent hits on mDNS, SSDP, and DNS ports might be typical in a network where devices are discovering each other and resolving domain names, but if the volume is unexpectedly high, it could warrant further investigation.\n- The absence of large packets reduces the likelihood of data exfiltration or buffer overflow attacks, which often rely on large payload sizes.\n\nIn terms of security posture, this log indicates a reasonably active network with typical protocol usage. The frequent drops from link-local addresses are the most notable feature and should be investigated to ensure they are not indicative of a misconfigured network or an internal actor attempting to communicate with external resources."

                            "High outgoing network traffic spikes as indicated by the task manager could be due to a variety of reasons. Here are some factors to consider and steps to potentially identify the cause:\n\n1. **Updates or Backups**:\n   - Your system or applications may be performing updates or backups. This can include operating system updates, software updates, cloud backups, or synchronization services.\n\n2. **Streaming or Sharing Services**:\n   - If you are running any media server applications or file-sharing services, such as Plex, DLNA servers, or peer-to-peer file-sharing applications, these could cause significant network traffic.\n\n3. **Cloud Services**:\n   - Sync services like Dropbox, Google Drive, OneDrive, or other cloud storage solutions might be uploading files, especially if you've recently added a large amount of data to a synchronized folder.\n\n4. **Malware or Virus**:\n   - Malicious software can generate traffic by communicating with external servers. Make sure your antivirus is up to date and consider running a full system scan.\n\n5. **Remote Access**:\n   - If your computer is set up to allow remote access, someone might be transferring files to or from your computer.\n\n6. **Network Services**:\n   - Hosting any services, such as web servers, game servers, or other types of servers can also account for traffic.\n\n7. **Application Activity**:\n   - Some applications, especially those that deal with multimedia or live data, may use significant network resources. This includes VoIP, video conferencing, live streaming, etc.\n\nHere\u2019s how you can investigate further:\n\n- **Resource Monitor**: Use the Resource Monitor to check which processes are using the network. This can be accessed by pressing `Ctrl+Shift+Esc` to open the Task Manager, then going to the `Performance` tab, and clicking on `Open Resource Monitor`. In the `Network` tab, you can see which processes have high send (Bytes Sent/sec) rates.\n  \n- **Network Performance Tools**: Use built-in tools like `perfmon` or third-party applications to get more detailed insights into your network usage.\n\n- **Firewall Logs**: You've already looked at the firewall logs. Correlate the times of high traffic with the log entries to see if there is a pattern or a specific service that corresponds with the spike.\n\n- **Virus Scan**: Run a full system antivirus scan to rule out malware.\n\n- **Data Usage Details**: In Windows settings under `Network & Internet`, you can find data usage details that may help you pinpoint which applications are using the most data.\n\nIf you find an unknown or unexpected process consuming bandwidth, you can research the process name online to determine its legitimacy and necessity. If it's non-essential or suspicious, you may choose to stop the process or uninstall the associated application."

Clearing them might reduce network usage.\n\n- **Review Sync Settings**: Go to `chrome://settings/` and check your Google Account sync settings. If you don't need everything to sync, you can turn off some options.\n\n- **Check for Malware**:\n   - Use Chrome\u2019s built-in tool by going to `chrome://settings/reset` and clicking on \u201cClean up computer\u201d.\n   - Use a trusted antivirus program to scan your system for malware.\n\n- **Monitor Network Usage**:\n   - You can use Chrome's built-in task manager (`Shift + Esc` while in Chrome) to see which tabs or extensions are using the most network resources.\n   - Use the network analysis tools in Chrome DevTools (`F12` or `Ctrl + Shift + I`, then click on the `Network` tab) to monitor network requests by the browser.\n\n- **Reset or Reinstall Chrome**: If all else fails, you can try resetting Chrome to its default settings or reinstalling it completely.\n\nBy taking these steps, you can potentially identify and stop the cause of the high network usage by Chrome."

                            "High disk usage in correlation with network activity, particularly with `chrome.exe`, can occur due to several factors, which may include:\n\n1. **Browser Cache Operations**: Chrome writes to the disk cache when loading websites. If you're visiting or loading a lot of content, especially media-rich sites, this can result in high disk write operations.\n\n2. **Downloads and Uploads**: When downloading files from the internet, Chrome will write these files to disk. Similarly, if you're uploading files, Chrome may use the disk to temporarily store and prepare the data for upload.\n\n3. **Extension and Web App Data**: Some Chrome extensions or web applications store data locally on the disk, which could cause spikes in disk usage when data is being read from or written to the disk.\n\n4. **Browser or Extension Updates**: Chrome automatically updates itself and its extensions. These updates involve downloading new files and replacing existing ones on the disk.\n\n5. **Malware or Adware**: Malicious software can cause unexpected disk and network activity. Adware, in particular, might generate network traffic to load advertisements and use the disk to cache these items.\n\n6. **Virtual Memory Paging**: If your system is low on RAM, Windows may use the paging file on your disk to compensate. Chrome is known for consuming a significant amount of memory, which could lead to increased virtual memory usage (paging).\n\n7. **Temporary Files**: Chrome and other applications create temporary files which are sometimes stored on the disk. If these files are associated with network activities, they can cause simultaneous disk and network spikes.\n\nTo address these issues, you can:\n\n- **Monitor Chrome\u2019s Task Manager**: Press `Shift + Esc` while in Chrome to open its task manager and monitor which tabs or extensions are using the disk and network resources.\n\n- **Check Disk Health**: Use tools like `chkdsk` to check the integrity of your disk. A failing disk can sometimes show increased activity due to read/write errors.\n\n- **Manage or Limit Cache Size**: You can limit the amount of data Chrome is allowed to cache. This is done through Chrome's flags settings or command-line arguments when starting Chrome.\n\n- **Scan for Malware**: Conduct a thorough scan of your computer using your antivirus software to rule out the presence of malware.\n\n- **Review Network Activity**: As previously mentioned, use the Resource Monitor or third-party applications to review detailed network activity and see if Chrome is indeed the cause.\n\n- **Increase or Manage Virtual Memory**: Adjust the size of the paging file if necessary, and ensure your system has enough RAM to handle your typical workload.\n\n- **Clear Temporary Files**: Use built-in cleanup utilities or third-party tools to clear out temporary files and other \"junk\" that might accumulate.\n\n- **Update or Reinstall Chrome**: Ensure Chrome is up-to-date, or try reinstalling it to fix any issues that might be causing excessive disk usage.\n\nIf you find that the issue persists and significantly impacts your system's performance, you might consider seeking further technical support. There could be deeper system issues or complex interactions between software and hardware that require a detailed analysis."

                            "PID stands for Process ID (Identifier). In computing, it is a unique number used by operating systems to identify a process. When any program is started, the operating system assigns it a unique PID that is used to track the process's execution and manage its resources.\n\nPIDs are important because they allow the operating system to manage multiple processes effectively. Each process on a system can be controlled and monitored using its PID. For example, if you want to terminate a specific process, you can use its PID to specify which process you want to end.\n\nOn Windows, you can see the PID of running processes in the Task Manager under the \"Details\" tab. In the context of network traffic and resource usage, knowing the PID can help you correlate high network or disk activity with the actual running program or service that's causing it. If you're seeing high activity in the Task Manager and you have the PID, you can use this information to investigate further and take action if necessary."

These logs can provide valuable information like source and destination IP addresses, port numbers, and protocols. You can also use the Windows Firewall log file to monitor TCP and UDP connections and packets that are blocked by the firewall.\nL99: \nL100: ##  Why and When Firewall Logging is Useful \nL101: \nL102:   1. To verify if newly added firewall rules work properly or to debug them if they do not work as expected. \nL103:   2. To determine if Windows Firewall is the cause of application failures \u2014 With the Firewall logging feature you can check for disabled port openings, dynamic port openings, analyze dropped packets with push and urgent flags and analyze dropped packets on the send path. \nL104:   3. To help and identify malicious activity \u2014 With the Firewall logging feature you can check if any malicious activity is occurring within your network or not, although you must remember it does not provide the information needed to track down the source of the activity. \nL105:   4. If you notice repeated unsuccessful attempts to access your firewall and/or other high profile systems from one IP address (or group of IP addresses), then you might want to write a rule to drop all connections from that IP space (making sure that the IP address isn\u2019t being spoofed). \nL106:   5. Outgoing connections coming from internal servers such as Web servers could be an indication that someone is using your system to launch attacks against computers located on other networks. \nL107: \nL108: ##  How to Generate the Log File \nL109: \nL110: By default, the log file is disabled, which means that no information is written to the log file. To create a log file press \u201cWin key + R\u201d to open the Run box. Type \u201cwf.msc\u201d and press Enter. The \u201cWindows Firewall with Advanced Security\u201d screen appears. On the right side of the screen, click \u201cProperties.\u201d\nL111: \nL112: [Image 1] \nL113: \nL114: A new dialog box appears. Now click the \u201cPrivate Profile\u201d tab and select \u201cCustomize\u201d in the \u201cLogging Section.\u201d\nL115: \nL116: [Image 2] \nL117: \nL118: A new window opens and from that screen choose your maximum log size, location, and whether to log only dropped packets, successful connection or both. A dropped packet is a packet that Windows Firewall has blocked. A successful connection refers both to incoming connections as well as any connection you have made over the Internet, but it doesn\u2019t always mean that an intruder has successfully connected to your computer.\nL119: \nL120: [Image 3] \nL121: \nL122: By default, Windows Firewall writes log entries to \nL123: \nL124:      %SystemRoot%\\System32\\LogFiles\\Firewall\\Pfirewall.log \nL125: \nL126: and stores only the last 4 MB of data. In most production environments, this log will constantly write to your hard disk, and if you change the size limit of the log file (to log activity over a long period of time) then it may cause a performance impact. For this reason, you should enable logging only when actively troubleshooting a problem and then immediately disable logging when you\u2019re finished.\nL127: \nL128: Next, click the \u201cPublic Profile\u201d tab and repeat the same steps you did for \u201cPrivate Profile\u201d tab. You\u2019ve now turned on the log for both private and public network connections. The log file will be created in a W3C extended log format (.log) that you can examine with a text editor of your choice or import them into a spreadsheet. A single log file can contain thousands of text entries, so if you are reading them through Notepad then disable word wrapping to preserve the column formatting. If you are viewing the log file in a spreadsheet then all the fields will be logically displayed in columns for easier analysis.\nL129: \nL130: On the main \u201cWindows Firewall with Advanced Security\u201d screen, scroll down until you see the \u201cMonitoring\u201d link. In the Details pane, under \u201cLogging Settings\u201d, click the file path next to \u201cFile Name.\u201d The log opens in Notepad.\nL131: \nL132: [Image 4] \nL133: \nL134: ##  Interpreting the Windows Firewall log \nL135: \nL136: The Windows Firewall security log contains two sections. The header provides static, descriptive information about the version of the log, and the fields available. The body of the log is the compiled data that is entered as a result of traffic that tries to cross the firewall. It is a dynamic list, and new entries keep appearing at the bottom of the log. The fields are written from left to right across the page. The (-) is used when there is no entry available for the field.\nL137: \nL138: [Image 5] \nL139: \nL140: According to the \u301057\u2020Microsoft Technet documentation\u2020technet.microsoft.com\u3011 the header of the log file contains:\nL141: \nL142: Version \u2014 Displays which version of the Windows Firewall security log is installed.\nL143: \nL144: Software \u2014 Displays the name of the software creating the log.\nL145: \nL146: Time \u2014 Indicates that all the timestamp information in the log are in local time.\nL147: \nL148: Fields \u2014 Displays a list of fields that are available for security log entries, if data is available.\nL149: \nL150: While the body of the log file contains:\nL151: \nL152: date \u2014 The date field identifies the date in the format YYYY-MM-DD.\nL153: \nL154: time \u2014 The local time is displayed in the log file using the format HH:MM:SS. The hours are referenced in 24-hour format.\nL155: \nL156: action \u2014 As the firewall processes traffic, certain actions are recorded. The logged actions are DROP for dropping a connection, OPEN for opening a connection, CLOSE for closing a connection, OPEN-INBOUND for an inbound session opened to the local computer, and INFO-EVENTS-LOST for events processed by the Windows Firewall, but were not recorded in the security log.\nL157: \nL158: protocol \u2014 The protocol used such as TCP, UDP, or ICMP.\nL159: \nL160: src-ip \u2014 Displays the source IP address (the IP address of the computer attempting to establish communication).\nL161: \nL162: dst-ip \u2014 Displays the destination IP address of a connection attempt.\nL163: \nL164: src-port \u2014 The port number on the sending computer from which the connection was attempted.\nL165: \nL166: dst-port \u2014 The port to which the sending computer was trying to make a connection.\nL167: \nL\nVisible: 11% - 59%",

To help and identify malicious activity \u2014 With the Firewall logging feature you can check if any malicious activity is occurring within your network or not, although you must remember it does not provide the information needed to track down the source of the activity. \nL105:   4. If you notice repeated unsuccessful attempts to access your firewall and/or other high profile systems from one IP address (or group of IP addresses), then you might want to write a rule to drop all connections from that IP space (making sure that the IP address isn\u2019t being spoofed). \nL106:   5. Outgoing connections coming from internal servers such as Web servers could be an indication that someone is using your system to launch attacks against computers located on other networks. \nL107: \nL108: ##  How to Generate the Log File \nL109: \nL110: By default, the log file is disabled, which means that no information is written to the log file. To create a log file press \u201cWin key + R\u201d to open the Run box. Type \u201cwf.msc\u201d and press Enter. The \u201cWindows Firewall with Advanced Security\u201d screen appears. On the right side of the screen, click \u201cProperties.\u201d\nL111: \nL112: [Image 1] \nL113: \nL114: A new dialog box appears. Now click the \u201cPrivate Profile\u201d tab and select \u201cCustomize\u201d in the \u201cLogging Section.\u201d\nL115: \nL116: [Image 2] \nL117: \nL118: A new window opens and from that screen choose your maximum log size, location, and whether to log only dropped packets, successful connection or both. A dropped packet is a packet that Windows Firewall has blocked. A successful connection refers both to incoming connections as well as any connection you have made over the Internet, but it doesn\u2019t always mean that an intruder has successfully connected to your computer.\nL119: \nL120: [Image 3] \nL121: \nL122: By default, Windows Firewall writes log entries to \nL123: \nL124:      %SystemRoot%\\System32\\LogFiles\\Firewall\\Pfirewall.log \nL125: \nL126: and stores only the last 4 MB of data. In most production environments, this log will constantly write to your hard disk, and if you change the size limit of the log file (to log activity over a long period of time) then it may cause a performance impact. For this reason, you should enable logging only when actively troubleshooting a problem and then immediately disable logging when you\u2019re finished.\nL127: \nL128: Next, click the \u201cPublic Profile\u201d tab and repeat the same steps you did for \u201cPrivate Profile\u201d tab. You\u2019ve now turned on the log for both private and public network connections. The log file will be created in a W3C extended log format (.log) that you can examine with a text editor of your choice or import them into a spreadsheet. A single log file can contain thousands of text entries, so if you are reading them through Notepad then disable word wrapping to preserve the column formatting. If you are viewing the log file in a spreadsheet then all the fields will be logically displayed in columns for easier analysis.\nL129: \nL130: On the main \u201cWindows Firewall with Advanced Security\u201d screen, scroll down until you see the \u201cMonitoring\u201d link. In the Details pane, under \u201cLogging Settings\u201d, click the file path next to \u201cFile Name.\u201d The log opens in Notepad.\nL131: \nL132: [Image 4] \nL133: \nL134: ##  Interpreting the Windows Firewall log \nL135: \nL136: The Windows Firewall security log contains two sections. The header provides static, descriptive information about the version of the log, and the fields available. The body of the log is the compiled data that is entered as a result of traffic that tries to cross the firewall. It is a dynamic list, and new entries keep appearing at the bottom of the log. The fields are written from left to right across the page. The (-) is used when there is no entry available for the field.\nL137: \nL138: [Image 5] \nL139: \nL140: According to the Microsoft Technet documentation the header of the log file contains:\nL141: \nL142: Version \u2014 Displays which version of the Windows Firewall security log is installed.\nL143: \nL144: Software \u2014 Displays the name of the software creating the log.\nL145: \nL146: Time \u2014 Indicates that all the timestamp information in the log are in local time.\nL147: \nL148: Fields \u2014 Displays a list of fields that are available for security log entries, if data is available.\nL149: \nL150: While the body of the log file contains:\nL151: \nL152: date \u2014 The date field identifies the date in the format YYYY-MM-DD.\nL153: \nL154: time \u2014 The local time is displayed in the log file using the format HH:MM:SS. The hours are referenced in 24-hour format.\nL155: \nL156: action \u2014 As the firewall processes traffic, certain actions are recorded. The logged actions are DROP for dropping a connection, OPEN for opening a connection, CLOSE for closing a connection, OPEN-INBOUND for an inbound session opened to the local computer, and INFO-EVENTS-LOST for events processed by the Windows Firewall, but were not recorded in the security log.\nL157: \nL158: protocol \u2014 The protocol used such as TCP, UDP, or ICMP.\nL159: \nL160: src-ip \u2014 Displays the source IP address (the IP address of the computer attempting to establish communication).\nL161: \nL162: dst-ip \u2014 Displays the destination IP address of a connection attempt.\nL163: \nL164: src-port \u2014 The port number on the sending computer from which the connection was attempted.\nL165: \nL166: dst-port \u2014 The port to which the sending computer was trying to make a connection.\nL167: \nL\nVisible: 11% - 59%",

It can be used for packet capture, packet drop detection, packet filtering and counting. The tool is especially helpful in virtualization scenarios, like container networking and SDN, because it provides visibility within the networking stack. It is available in-box via the pktmon.exe command and via Windows Admin Center extensions.\nL35: \nL36: ## Overview\nL37: \nL38: Any machine that communicates over the network has at least one network adapter. All the components between this adapter and an application form a networking stack: a set of networking components that process and move networking traffic. In traditional scenarios, the networking stack is small, and all the packet routing and switching happens in external devices.\nL39: \nL40: [Image 0: Networking stack in traditional scenarios] \nL41: \nL42: However, with the advent of network virtualization, the size of the networking stack has multiplied. This extended networking stack now includes components like the Virtual Switch that handle packet processing and switching. Such a flexible environment allows for much better resource utilization and security isolation, but it also leaves more room for configuration mistakes that can be hard to diagnose. Packet Monitor provides the enhanced visibility within the networking stack that is often needed to pinpoint these mistakes.\nL43: \nL44: [Image 1: PacketMon's cross-component packet capture] \nL45: \nL46: Packet Monitor intercepts packets at multiple locations throughout the networking stack, exposing the packet route. If a packet was dropped by a supported component in the networking stack, Packet Monitor will report that packet drop. This allows users to differentiate between a component that is the intended destination for a packet and a component that is interfering with a packet. Additionally, Packet Monitor will report drop reasons; for example, MTU Mismatch, or Filtered VLAN, etc. These drop reasons provide the root cause of the issue without the need to exhaust all the possibilities. Packet Monitor also provides packet counters for each intercept point, enabling a high-level packet flow examination without the need for time-consuming log analysis.\nL47: \nL48: [Image 2: PacketMon's drop detection] \nL49: \nL50: ## Best Practices\nL51: \nL52: Use these best practices for streamlining your network analysis.\nL53: \nL54:   * Check command-line help for arguments and capabilities (e.g. pktmon start help).\nL55:   * Configure packet filters matching your scenario (pktmon filter add).\nL56:   * Check packet counters during the experiment for high level view (pktmon counters).\nL57:   * Look into the log for detailed analysis (pktmon format pktmon.etl).\nL58: \nL59: ## Functionality\nL60: \nL61: Packet Monitor offers the following functionality:\nL62: \nL63:   * Packet monitoring and counting at multiple locations along the networking stack\nL64:   * Packets drop detection at multiple stack locations\nL65:   * Flexible runtime packet filtering with encapsulation support\nL66:   * General logging and tracing support (ETW and WPP events)\nL67:   * TXT log analysis based on TcpDump packet parsing\nL68:   * Multiple logging modes: real-time, high volume in-memory, multi-file, circular\nL69:   * Ethernet, Wi-Fi, and mobile broadband media type support\nL70:   * PCAPNG format support\nL71: \nL72: ## Get started with Packet Monitor\nL73: \nL74: The following resources are available to help you get started using Packet Monitor.\nL75: \nL76: ### \u30105\u2020Pktmon command syntax and formatting\u3011\nL77: \nL78: Packet Monitor is available in-box via pktmon.exe command on Vibranium OS (build 19041).

                            "To monitor and log all in/out network traffic on your Windows machine in detail, you can use built-in tools like Windows Firewall logging and Packet Monitor (Pktmon), as well as third-party software solutions. Here's how you can do it:\n\n### Using Windows Firewall Logging:\n1. **Enable Logging**: By default, the Windows Firewall log is disabled. To enable it, press \u201cWin key + R\u201d, type \u201cwf.msc\u201d and press Enter to open the \"Windows Firewall with Advanced Security\" screen. Click \u201cProperties\u201d, then select the \u201cPrivate Profile\u201d tab and click \u201cCustomize\u201d in the \u201cLogging Section\u201d. Here, you can set the maximum log size, log file location, and whether to log only dropped packets, successful connections, or both\u301013\u2020source\u3011\u301014\u2020source\u3011.\n2. **Log File Location**: The log entries are written to `%SystemRoot%\\System32\\LogFiles\\Firewall\\Pfirewall.log` and the file stores only the last 4 MB of data\u301014\u2020source\u3011.\n3. **Reading the Log File**: You can view the log file using a text editor or import it into a spreadsheet for analysis. The log file is in W3C extended log format, and a single file can contain thousands of entries\u301015\u2020source\u3011.\n4. **Interpreting the Log**: The log contains detailed information about each packet, such as the date, time, action (DROP, OPEN, CLOSE, etc.), protocol, source and destination IP addresses, and source and destination ports\u301016\u2020source\u3011.\n\n### Using Packet Monitor (Pktmon):\n1. **Tool Description**: Pktmon is a cross-component network diagnostics tool available in Windows. It is used for packet capture, packet drop detection, packet filtering, and counting\u301022\u2020source\u3011.\n2. **Functionality**: It can intercept packets at various points in the networking stack, report packet drops along with the reasons for these drops, and allow for packet flow examination without detailed log analysis\u301023\u2020source\u3011.\n3. **Usage**: To use Pktmon, you can utilize command-line help for arguments and capabilities (`pktmon start help`), configure packet filters (`pktmon filter add`), and analyze logs (`pktmon format pktmon.etl`) for detailed information\u301024\u2020source\u3011.\n4. **Capabilities**: Pktmon supports packet monitoring, drop detection, flexible packet filtering, various logging modes, and it can create logs in PCAPNG format, which can be analyzed with tools like Wireshark\u301025\u2020source\u3011.\n\nFor more advanced or user-friendly features, you might consider third-party software solutions such as Wireshark, TCPDump, or NetworkMiner. These tools often come with GUIs and additional features for traffic analysis and visualization. They can capture and log network traffic and provide detailed information about each packet, which can be useful for in-depth network analysis and troubleshooting. Always ensure that you have the appropriate permissions to monitor network traffic, as capturing packets might be subject to legal and ethical guidelines."

The header provides static, descriptive information about the version of the log, and the fields available. The body of the log is the compiled data that is entered as a result of traffic that tries to cross the firewall. It is a dynamic list, and new entries keep appearing at the bottom of the log. The fields are written from left to right across the page. The (-) is used when there is no entry available for the field.\n\n[Image 5] \n\nAccording to the \u301057\u2020Microsoft Technet documentation\u2020technet.microsoft.com\u3011 the header of the log file contains:\n\nVersion \u2014 Displays which version of the Windows Firewall security log is installed.\n\nSoftware \u2014 Displays the name of the software creating the log.\n\nTime \u2014 Indicates that all the timestamp information in the log are in local time.\n\nFields \u2014 Displays a list of fields that are available for security log entries, if data is available.\n\nWhile the body of the log file contains:\n\ndate \u2014 The date field identifies the date in the format YYYY-MM-DD.\n\ntime \u2014 The local time is displayed in the log file using the format HH:MM:SS. The hours are referenced in 24-hour format.\n\naction \u2014 As the firewall processes traffic, certain actions are recorded. The logged actions are DROP for dropping a connection, OPEN for opening a connection, CLOSE for closing a connection, OPEN-INBOUND for an inbound session opened to the local computer, and INFO-EVENTS-LOST for events processed by the Windows Firewall, but were not recorded in the security log.\n\nprotocol \u2014 The protocol used such as TCP, UDP, or ICMP.\n\nsrc-ip \u2014 Displays the source IP address (the IP address of the computer attempting to establish communication).\n\ndst-ip \u2014 Displays the destination IP address of a connection attempt.\n\nsrc-port \u2014 The port number on the sending computer from which the connection was attempted.\n\ndst-port \u2014 The port to which the sending computer was trying to make a connection.",

Open the Windows Firewall with Advanced Security by pressing `Win key + R`, then type `wf.msc` and press Enter.\n2. In the firewall window, on the right side, click on `Properties`.\n3. Navigate to the tab for the profile you are interested in (Domain, Private, Public).\n4. In the Logging section, click the `Customize` button.\n5. Note the path where the log file is saved (by default, `%SystemRoot%\\System32\\LogFiles\\Firewall\\Pfirewall.log`).\n6. Navigate to this path using File Explorer, or copy the path and paste it into the File Explorer address bar.\n7. Double-click on the `Pfirewall.log` file to open it with the default text editor (usually Notepad)\u301015\u2020source\u3011.\n\nThe log file will open, and you can view the detailed log entries.

                            "To reset a Mac that is infected, you should perform a factory reset, which will erase all the data on the machine and reinstall macOS. Here's how you can do this:\n\n1. **Backup Important Data:**\n   - Before you reset your Mac, make sure to back up any important data you want to keep. You can use Time Machine or copy files to an external drive or cloud storage.\n\n2. **Enter Recovery Mode:**\n   - Restart your Mac and immediately press and hold the Command (\u2318) and R keys until you see an Apple logo or other image.\n\n3. **Disk Utility:**\n   - From the utilities window that appears, select 'Disk Utility' and click Continue.\n   - Choose your startup disk (usually labeled 'Macintosh HD') from the sidebar and click the 'Erase' button.\n   - Select 'APFS' (for SSDs) or 'Mac OS Extended (Journaled)' (for HDDs) from the Format list, and GUID Partition Map from the Scheme list.\n   - Click Erase. Once the process is complete, close Disk Utility.\n\n4. **Reinstall macOS:**\n   - In the utilities window, select 'Reinstall macOS' and click Continue.\n   - Follow the onscreen instructions to reinstall macOS.\n\n5. **Restore Data:**\n   - After reinstalling the OS, you can restore your backed-up data during the setup process or manually afterwards.\n\nIf your Mac is infected to the point where you cannot access the Recovery Mode or if you suspect the recovery partition is also infected, you may need to create a bootable installer for macOS on a separate clean computer and use it to reinstall macOS.\n\nKeep in mind that factory resetting will remove all data from your Mac, so it should only be done if you are certain you have a backup of your data or if there is nothing on the machine you need."

Here are some ways to see the network traffic in and out of your machine:\n\n1. **Activity Monitor:**\n   - Open Activity Monitor from the Utilities folder in your Applications folder.\n   - Click on the Network tab to monitor network activity in real-time.\n\n2. **Terminal Commands:**\n   - Use command-line tools such as `netstat`, `lsof -i`, `tcpdump`, or `ifconfig` to monitor network connections and traffic. For example, you can use `sudo tcpdump -i any` to capture all network traffic.\n\n3. **Wireshark:**\n   - Install Wireshark, a third-party application that is a powerful network protocol analyzer.\n   - Use Wireshark to capture and interactively browse the traffic running on a computer network.\n\n4. **Little Snitch:**\n   - Install Little Snitch, a network monitor that shows outgoing connections and lets you control inbound and outbound traffic.\n   - Little Snitch provides a detailed real-time traffic overview and powerful, yet simple options for analyzing traffic totals, bandwidth, connectivity status.\n\n5. **Private Eye:**\n   - Private Eye is a real-time network monitoring application that can show you the current network connections and which applications are making those connections.\n\n6. **Built-in Console App:**\n   - The Console app, found in the Utilities folder, can also be used to view network traffic logs if the system is set to verbose logging.\n\nEach tool has its own set of features and complexity. For instance, Activity Monitor provides an easy-to-understand overview, while Wireshark offers deep packet analysis capabilities. Choose the tool that best fits your level of expertise and your specific requirements."

It's cool because it helps you know how we do everything on them, like making art, writing code, putting new apps on them, or snapping photos. Knowing a little bit about computers can make it easier to use them.\n\nHere's what you'll do: Watch a video, and then use what you learn to answer some questions. You can rewind to watch parts again or fast forward if you need to. Make sure to write your answers in full sentences.\n\nI think it's a good idea to watch the whole video once without worrying about the questions. Then, watch it again and pause it when you need to write down your answers.

It will go at the top of Google Classroom.\n\nObjective: Design a unique and creative banner that represents this class or inspires this learning environment. Your design can be anything you imagine \u2013 a class mascot, an abstract art piece, a landscape, or something else entirely! Don't limit yourself.\n\nInstructions:\n\nConceptualize Your Design:\n\nThink about what represents computer science class in today's age, or what you'd like to see every day on our Classroom page.You can sketch ideas or type them down first in drawings or docs if you want.\nKEEP IN MIND - the image will be the same dimensions and size as the image above.\nLearn About Prompting:\n\nA prompt is a very detailed description that Artificial Intelligence models use to generate text and images.The more specific you are, the more closely the result will match your idea. Prompts are basically programming code for AI - prompts are the instructions they follow.\nWrite Your Prompt:\n\nBegin with the main subject of your banner (e.g., a mascot, a landscape, a scene, a cartoon, anything,...).Describe the setting or background. Add details about colors or lack of them, mood, style, and any objects or elements you want to include.\nUse the Template (if needed):\nReplace the [brackets] with your own words.\n\nI want an image of [main subject] that is [adjectives/descriptions] in a [setting/background]. There should be [additional elements] around/in it.The colors should be [describe color scheme], and the overall mood is [mood/atmosphere] in a [style/look] style. \n\n(you can add or take away [elements] if you want)\nReview Your Prompt:\n\nMake sure it's clear and descriptive. Check if you've included the main subject, setting, details, style, and mood and anything else you want to include.\nSubmit Your Prompt:\n\nShare your prompt below in this form. If you need to, start a new Google Doc to brainstorm ideas before filling this out. The winning prompt(s) will be used to generate the actual banner using Artificial Intelligence.\nExample Prompt: \"I want an image of a friendly dragon that is sitting atop a pile of books. The dragon should be cartoonish and colorful, with scales that shimmer in shades of green and blue. The background should be a library with rows of bookshelves, and the dragon is wearing a pair of round glasses. There should be an apple and a pencil beside the dragon. The colors should be bright and inviting, and the overall mood is cheerful and welcoming to learners. The style should look like it was made with color pencils by a master artist\"\n\nExample Image: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vaEKM9H7mdmtarHF9uHbNgh2Y2N_8ZPR/view?usp=sharing \n\nRemember: Creativity is key! Your idea doesn't have to be literal or conventional. Think outside the box and have fun with it!\n\n\n\n"

You can make up anything! A class mascot, a funky art piece, or a cool scene \u2013 there's no limit.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Dream Up Your Design:\n   Consider what symbols or images you feel capture our computer science class or what you'd like to greet you on our Classroom page every day. You can doodle some designs or jot down ideas first.\n\n   Remember: Your banner should be the same shape and size as the sample above.\n\n2. Understand Prompting:\n   A prompt is a super-detailed instruction that tells AI models how to make texts and pictures. The better your instructions, the more the AI can create what you're imagining. Think of prompts like a recipe for the AI to follow.\n\n3. Craft Your Prompt:\n   Start with the main focus of your banner. Describe where it is and what's around it. Think about colors, feelings, style, and any specific things you want in there.\n\n   Use the Template (optional):\n   Fill in the blanks:\n\n   \"I want an image of [main subject] that looks [adjectives/descriptions] in a [setting/background]. It should have [extra stuff] with it. The colors should be [colors], and it feels [mood/atmosphere] in a [style/look] style.\"\n\n   Add or remove details as you like.\n\n4. Double-Check Your Prompt:\n   Make sure it's super clear and paints a picture of what you want. Check if you've included the main focus, place, details, style, and vibe.\n\n5. Send In Your Prompt:\n   Put your prompt in the form below. If it helps, open a new Google Doc to brainstorm before you submit. The best prompts will guide the AI to make our actual banner.\n\nExample: \"I want an image of a cheerful dragon on a pile of books. It should be cartoony and colorful, with shiny green and blue scales. It's in a library with lots of bookshelves, wearing glasses. Include an apple and a pencil next to it. The colors should be bright and welcoming, and it feels happy and inviting for students. It looks like it's drawn with colored pencils by a pro artist.\"\n\nExample Image: [Link provided]\n\nRemember: Be creative! Your idea can be wild and unique. Have a blast with it!"
