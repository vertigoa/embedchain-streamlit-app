This will grant the necessary permissions for me to create and manage content on that page.\n\nHere's how to share the page with the integration:\n\n1. Open the Notion page where you'd like the database to be created.\n2. Click on the \"Share\" button at the top-right corner of the page.\n3. Under the \"Invite to Page\" section, you should see an option to add your integration. Click on it to add.\n\nOnce you've done that, please let me know so we can proceed with creating the demo database."

Here's a step-by-step guide:\n\n1. **Open Notion and Navigate to the Desired Location**: Open your Notion workspace and go to the page where you'd like to create the new database.\n\n2. **Add a New Block**: Click on the empty space and type `/` to bring up the block menu.\n\n3. **Choose Database Type**: Type \"Table\" to filter the options and select \"Table - Full Page\" or \"Table - Inline\" based on your preference.\n\n4. **Name Your Database**: Once the table appears, you'll see a space at the top to name your database. Type \"Resource Revisiter\" there.\n\n5. **Add Columns**: \n    - **Favicon**: Create a column and set its type to \"URL.\"\n    - **Site and Page Title**: Create a column and set its type to \"Text.\"\n    - **Site Description**: Create a column and set its type to \"Text.\"\n    - **Page Description**: Create a column and set its type to \"Text.\"\n    - **Date Added**: Create a column and set its type to \"Date.\"\n    - **Notes**: Create a column and set its type to \"Text.\"\n\n6. **Set Icon**: Optionally, you can set an icon for your database by clicking the \"Add Icon\" button next to the database name. You could use the \"\ud83d\udd17\" emoji for relevance.\n\n7. **Save**: Your changes will be saved automatically.\n\nOnce you've created the database, let me know, and we can proceed with adding entries based on the links and notes you provide."

After that, I updated the demo database to match the specifications you provided for \"Resource Revisiter.\"\n\nIt seems like the issue might be related to permissions or some other constraints on the initial pages you provided, but it's not entirely clear. Your workaround effectively bypassed the problem by choosing a different location for the database.\n\nIs there anything specific you'd like to discuss further about this issue? \ud83d\ude0a"

                            "Creating a mobile app that integrates GPT-4 and the Idea Organizer plugin for Notion would be a complex but feasible project. Here's a high-level overview of how you could approach it:\n\n### Technologies Needed:\n1. **Mobile App Development Framework**: React Native, Flutter, or Swift/Java for native apps.\n2. **Backend Server**: Node.js, Python (Flask or Django), or any other backend technology to handle API requests.\n3. **Database**: Firebase, MongoDB, or any SQL database to store user data if needed.\n4. **Notion API**: To integrate the Idea Organizer plugin functionalities.\n5. **GPT-4 API**: To integrate GPT-4 functionalities.\n\n### Steps:\n\n#### Backend Development:\n1. **API Endpoints**: Create API endpoints that will interact with the Notion API and GPT-4 API.\n2. **User Authentication**: Implement user authentication if you want to personalize the Notion workspace for each user.\n3. **Data Processing**: Implement logic to process the text entered by the user and interact with GPT-4 and Notion accordingly.\n\n#### Mobile App Development:\n1. **UI/UX Design**: Design the user interface and experience.\n2. **API Integration**: Integrate the API endpoints you created in the backend.\n3. **Text Input**: Implement a text input field where the user can type.\n4. **Data Display**: Display the processed data from GPT-4 and Notion.\n\n#### Integration:\n1. **Connect Backend and Frontend**: Make sure the mobile app can communicate with the backend server.\n2. **Testing**: Rigorous testing to ensure everything works as expected.\n\n#### Deployment:\n1. **Backend Deployment**: Deploy the backend server.\n2. **Mobile App Deployment**: Deploy the mobile app to app stores.\n\n### Challenges:\n1. **Rate Limits**: Both Notion and GPT-4 APIs have rate limits that you'll need to manage.\n2. **Cost**: GPT-4 API is not free, and depending on the usage, costs can add up.\n3. **Complexity**: Handling real-time interactions between a mobile app, GPT-4, and Notion can be complex.\n\nWhile this is a high-level overview, each step would involve a lot of details. If you're serious about this project, you might want to consult with software developers for a more in-depth plan."

Here's a simplified example using Python with the `requests` library to call the GPT API:\n\n```python\nimport requests\nimport json\n\n# API settings\napi_key = \"your_openai_api_key_here\"\nendpoint = \"https://api.openai.com/v1/engines/davinci-codex/completions\"\nheaders = {\n    \"Authorization\": f\"Bearer {api_key}\",\n    \"Content-Type\": \"application/json\"\n}\n\n# Conversation payload\npayload = {\n    \"prompt\": [\n        {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Can you help me create a Notion database?\"},\n        {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"Of course! What would you like to name the database?\"}\n        # ... (continue the conversation)\n    ],\n    \"max_tokens\": 100\n}\n\n# Make the API call\nresponse = requests.post(endpoint, headers=headers, json=payload)\n\n# Parse the response\noutput = json.loads(response.text)\n\n# Extract and print the assistant's reply\nassistant_reply = output['choices'][0]['message']['content']\nprint(\"Assistant: \", assistant_reply)\n```\n\nIn this example, `api_key` would be your OpenAI API key, and `endpoint` would be the API endpoint for the engine you're using (e.g., `davinci-codex` for GPT-3). The `headers` dictionary includes the API key for authorization.\n\nThe `payload` dictionary contains the conversation history and other settings like `max_tokens`, which limits the response length.\n\nRemember to install the `requests` library if you haven't:\n\n```bash\npip install requests\n```\n\nThis is a simplified example to get you started. You can add more features like error handling, logging, etc., as needed."

Lower values (e.g., 0.2) make the output more focused and deterministic, while higher values (e.g., 0.8) make it more random.\n\n4. **`top_p`**: Controls diversity via nucleus sampling: only the tokens with a cumulative probability above `top_p` are kept. Values between 0.7 and 1.0 are generally good starting points.\n\n5. **`frequency_penalty`**: Penalizes new tokens based on their frequency in the training data. Ranges from -2 to 2.\n\n6. **`presence_penalty`**: Penalizes new tokens based on how often they appear given the context. Ranges from -2 to 2.\n\n7. **`stop_sequences`**: An array of strings that indicate stopping points for the generated text.\n\nHere's a sample JSON payload incorporating these fields:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prompt\": \"Translate the following English text to French: '{}'\",\n  \"max_tokens\": 60,\n  \"temperature\": 0.7,\n  \"top_p\": 0.9,\n  \"frequency_penalty\": 0,\n  \"presence_penalty\": 0,\n  \"stop_sequences\": [\"\\n\"]\n}\n```\n\nFeel free to fill in these fields with the values that suit your specific use case!"

                            "In a conversational model like GPT-4, you can use a system message to set the behavior of the assistant. The system message is usually the first message in the conversation and is used to guide the assistant's behavior throughout the conversation.\n\nHere's a sample JSON payload that includes a system message along with user and assistant messages:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"messages\": [\n    {\n      \"role\": \"system\",\n      \"content\": \"You are a helpful assistant.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"user\",\n      \"content\": \"Who won the world series in 2020?\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"assistant\",\n      \"content\": \"The Los Angeles Dodgers won the World Series in 2020.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"user\",\n      \"content\": \"Translate the word 'hello' to French.\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"max_tokens\": 50\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the system message sets the assistant's role as a \"helpful assistant.\" The conversation then proceeds with alternating user and assistant messages. The assistant's behavior in responding to the user's queries is guided by the initial system message.\n\nYou can customize the system message to be more specific about what you want. For example:\n\n- \"You are an assistant that speaks like Shakespeare.\"\n- \"You are an assistant trained in medical terminology.\"\n- \"You are an assistant that only responds in rhymes.\"\n\nThese system messages help in setting the context or behavior for the assistant."

Here are the functionalities it provides:\n\n### Search\n- **searchEndpoint**: Searches for all pages or databases that have titles including the query parameter. You can also sort the results and filter them to show only pages or only databases.\n\n### Page Operations\n- **getPageEndpoint**: Retrieves information about a specific Notion page using its ID. This only includes the page's properties, not its content.\n  \n### Block Operations\n- **getBlockEndpoint**: Retrieves a specific block by its ID. Pages are also considered blocks, so you can provide a page ID to this endpoint.\n- **getBlockChildrenEndpoint**: Returns a paginated array of child block objects contained in a specific block using its ID. You may need to recursively retrieve the block children of child blocks for a complete representation.\n\n### Database Operations\n- **getDatabaseEndpoint**: Retrieves information that describes the structure and columns of a specific Notion database using its ID.\n- **queryDatabaseEndpoint**: Gets a list of pages contained in a specific database, filtered and ordered according to the conditions provided.\n\nWould you like to do anything specific with your Notion workspace?"

Judicial determinations respecting unconscionable leases: (a) Lease characteristics; authorization by unit owners; conditions precedent to action Cooperative and condominium unit owners through the unit owners' association may bring an action seeking a judicial determination that a lease or leases, or portions thereof, were unconscionable at the time they were made. An action may be brought under this section if each such lease has all of the following characteristics: (1) it was made in connection with a cooperative or condominium project; (2) it was entered into while the cooperative or condominium owners' association was controlled by the developer either through special developer control or because the developer held a majority of the votes in the owners' association; (3) it had to be accepted or ratified by purchasers or through the unit owners' association as a condition of purchase of a unit in the cooperative or condominium project; (4) it is for a period of more than twenty-one years or is for a period of less than twenty-one years but contains automatic renewal provisions for a period of more than twenty-one years; (5) it contains an automatic rent increase clause; and (6) it was entered into prior to June 4, 1975. Such action must be authorized by the cooperative or condominium unit owners through a vote of not less than two-thirds of the owners of the units other than units owned by the developer or an affiliate of the developer, and may be brought by the cooperative or condominium unit owners through the units owners' association. Prior to instituting such action, the cooperative or condominium unit owners must, through a vote of not less than two-thirds of the owners of the units other than units owned by the developer or an affiliate of the developer, agree to enter into negotiation with the lessor and must seek through such negotiation to eliminate or modify any lease terms that are alleged to be unconscionable; if an agreement is not reached in ninety days from the date on which the authorizing vote was taken, the unit owners may authorize an action after following the procedure specified in the preceding sentence. (b) Presumption of unconscionability; rebuttal A rebuttal presumption of unconscionability exists if it is established that, in addition to the characteristics set forth in subsection (a) of this section, the lease\u2014 (1) creates a lien subjecting any unit to foreclosure for failure to make payments; (2) contains provisions requiring either the cooperative or condominium unit owners or the cooperative or condominium association as lessees to assume all or substantially all obligations and liabilities associated with the maintenance, management and use of the leased property, in addition to the obligation to make lease payments; (3) contains an automatic rent increase clause without establishing a specific maximum lease payment; and (4) requires an annual rental which exceeds 25 per centum of the appraised value of the leased property as improved: Provided, That, for purposes of this paragraph \\\"annual rental\\\" means the amount due during the first twelve months of the lease for all units, regardless of whether such units were occupied or sold during that period, and \\\"appraised value\\\" means the appraised value placed upon the leased property the first tax year after the sale of a unit in the condominium or after the sale of a membership or share interest in the cooperative association to a party who is not an affiliate of the developer. Once the rebuttable presumption is established, the court, in making its finding, shall consider the lease or portion of the lease to be unconscionable unless proven otherwise by the preponderance of the evidence to the contrary. (c) Presentation of evidence after finding of unconscionability Whenever it is claimed, or appears to the court, that a lease or any portion thereof is, or may have been, unconscionable at the time it was made, the parties shall be afforded a reasonable opportunity to present evidence at least as to\u2013 (1) the commercial setting of the negotiations; (2) whether a party has knowingly taken advantage of the inability of the other party reasonably to protect his interests; (3) the effect and purpose of the lease or portion of the lease or portion thereof, including its relationship to other contracts between the association, the unit owners and the developer or an affiliate of the developer; and (4) the disparity between the amount charged under the lease and the value of the real estate subject to the lease measured by the price at which similar real estate was readily obtainable in similar transactions. (d) Remedial relief; matters considered; attorneys' fees Upon finding that any lease, or portion thereof, is unconscionable, the court shall exercise its authority to grant remedial relief as necessary to avoid an unconscionable result, taking into consideration the economic value of the lease. Such relief may include, but shall not be limited to rescission, reformation, restitution, the award of damages and reasonable attorney fees and court costs. A defendant may recover reasonable attorneys' fees if the court determines that the cause of action filed by the plantiff\u00a01 is frivolous, malicious, or lacking in substantial merit. (e) Actions allowed after termination of special developer control Nothing in this section may be construed to authorize the bringing of an action by cooperative and condominium unit owners' association, seeking a judicial determination that a lease or leases, or portions thereof, are unconscionable, where such unit owners or a unit owners' association representing them has, after the termination of special developer control, reached an agreement with a holder of such lease or leases which either\u2014 (1) sets forth the terms and conditions under which such lease or leases is or shall be purchased by such unit owners or associations; or (2) reforms any clause in the lease which contained an automatic rent increase clause, unless such agreement was entered into when the leaseholder or his affiliate held a majority of the votes in the owners' association.\\n\\nTITLE 50\u2014WAR AND NATIONAL DEFENSE, CHAPTER 50\u2014SERVICEMEMBERS CIVIL RELIEF, SUBCHAPTER III\u2014RENT, INSTALLMENT CONTRACTS, MORTGAGES, LIENS, ASSIGNMENT, LEASES, COMMUNICATIONS SERVICE CONTRACTS, \u00a73951. Evictions and distress: (a) Court-ordered eviction (1) In general Except by court order, a landlord (or another person with paramount title) may not\u2014 (A) evict a servicemember, or the dependents of a servicemember, during a period of military service of the servicemember, from premises\u2014 (i) that are occupied or intended to be occupied primarily as a residence; and (ii) for which the monthly rent does not exceed $2,400, as adjusted under paragraph (2) for years after 2003; or (B) subject such premises to a distress during the period of military service. (2) Housing price inflation adjustment (A) For calendar years beginning with 2004, the amount in effect under paragraph (1)(A)(ii) shall be increased by the housing price inflation adjustment for the calendar year involved. (B) For purposes of this paragraph\u2014 (i) The housing price inflation adjustment for any calendar year is the percentage change (if any) by which\u2014 (I) the CPI housing component for November of the preceding calendar year, exceeds (II) the CPI housing component for November of 1984. (ii) The term \\\"CPI housing component\\\" means the index published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the Department of Labor known as the Consumer Price Index, All Urban Consumers, Rent of Primary Residence, U.S. City Average. (3) Publication of housing price inflation adjustment The Secretary of Defense shall cause to be published in the Federal Register each year the amount in effect under paragraph (1)(A)(ii) for that year following the housing price inflation adjustment for that year pursuant to paragraph (2). Such publication shall be made for a year not later than 60 days after such adjustment is made for that year. (b) Stay of execution (1) Court authority Upon an application for eviction or distress with respect to premises covered by this section, the court may on its own motion and shall, if a request is made by or on behalf of a servicemember whose ability to pay the agreed rent is materially affected by military service\u2014 (A) stay the proceedings for a period of 90 days, unless in the opinion of the court, justice and equity require a longer or shorter period of time; or (B) adjust the obligation under the lease to preserve the interests of all parties. (2) Relief to landlord If a stay is granted under paragraph (1), the court may grant to the landlord (or other person with paramount title) such relief as equity may require. (c) Misdemeanor Except as provided in subsection (a), a person who knowingly takes part in an eviction or distress described in subsection (a), or who knowingly attempts to do so, shall be fined as provided in title 18, or imprisoned for not more than one year, or both. (d) Rent allotment from pay of servicemember To the extent required by a court order related to property which is the subject of a court action under this section, the Secretary concerned shall make an allotment from the pay of a servicemember to satisfy the terms of such order, except that any such allotment shall be subject to regulations prescribed by the Secretary concerned establishing the maximum amount of pay of servicemembers that may be allotted under this subsection. (e) Limitation of applicability Section 3932 of this title is not applicable to this section.\\n\\nCite any applicable laws and include them in quotation marks \\\"\\\".

Specifically, you ask: Is air conditioning considered a part of a state court facility, and therefore, the furnishing of which is a duty of the City and County of Denver?\\n\\nCan the City and County of Denver use the agreement between Harry Lawson, the former state court administrator, and representatives of the City and County of Denver, as a basis for refusing to consider or provide air conditioning in the State Courts?\\n\\nThe answer to your first question is that the City and County of Denver has the continuing responsibility of providing and maintaining adequate courtrooms and other court facilities. This has been interpreted to include all physical requirements, specifically ventilation and related items, such as air conditioning.\\n\\nIn answer to your second question, any contract or agreement, such as the one between Harry Lawson and the City and County of Denver, which is in derogation of the statute, is void.

Therefore, I can't provide a case law that directly answers your question.\n\nHowever, under Colorado law, landlords are generally required to maintain a habitable property, which includes providing essential services like heating and, in some cases, air conditioning if it was provided as part of the rental agreement. If the landlord fails to make necessary repairs, tenants may have the right to withhold rent or make the repairs themselves and deduct the cost from the rent, but these actions come with risks and specific procedures must be followed.\n\nWould you like to know more about federal laws that might be relevant to your situation?"

Judicial determinations respecting unconscionable leases: (a) Lease characteristics; authorization by unit owners; conditions precedent to action Cooperative and condominium unit owners through the unit owners' association may bring an action seeking a judicial determination that a lease or leases, or portions thereof, were unconscionable at the time they were made. An action may be brought under this section if each such lease has all of the following characteristics: (1) it was made in connection with a cooperative or condominium project; (2) it was entered into while the cooperative or condominium owners' association was controlled by the developer either through special developer control or because the developer held a majority of the votes in the owners' association; (3) it had to be accepted or ratified by purchasers or through the unit owners' association as a condition of purchase of a unit in the cooperative or condominium project; (4) it is for a period of more than twenty-one years or is for a period of less than twenty-one years but contains automatic renewal provisions for a period of more than twenty-one years; (5) it contains an automatic rent increase clause; and (6) it was entered into prior to June 4, 1975. Such action must be authorized by the cooperative or condominium unit owners through a vote of not less than two-thirds of the owners of the units other than units owned by the developer or an affiliate of the developer, and may be brought by the cooperative or condominium unit owners through the units owners' association. Prior to instituting such action, the cooperative or condominium unit owners must, through a vote of not less than two-thirds of the owners of the units other than units owned by the developer or an affiliate of the developer, agree to enter into negotiation with the lessor and must seek through such negotiation to eliminate or modify any lease terms that are alleged to be unconscionable; if an agreement is not reached in ninety days from the date on which the authorizing vote was taken, the unit owners may authorize an action after following the procedure specified in the preceding sentence. (b) Presumption of unconscionability; rebuttal A rebuttal presumption of unconscionability exists if it is established that, in addition to the characteristics set forth in subsection (a) of this section, the lease\u2014 (1) creates a lien subjecting any unit to foreclosure for failure to make payments; (2) contains provisions requiring either the cooperative or condominium unit owners or the cooperative or condominium association as lessees to assume all or substantially all obligations and liabilities associated with the maintenance, management and use of the leased property, in addition to the obligation to make lease payments; (3) contains an automatic rent increase clause without establishing a specific maximum lease payment; and (4) requires an annual rental which exceeds 25 per centum of the appraised value of the leased property as improved: Provided, That, for purposes of this paragraph \\\"annual rental\\\" means the amount due during the first twelve months of the lease for all units, regardless of whether such units were occupied or sold during that period, and \\\"appraised value\\\" means the appraised value placed upon the leased property the first tax year after the sale of a unit in the condominium or after the sale of a membership or share interest in the cooperative association to a party who is not an affiliate of the developer. Once the rebuttable presumption is established, the court, in making its finding, shall consider the lease or portion of the lease to be unconscionable unless proven otherwise by the preponderance of the evidence to the contrary. (c) Presentation of evidence after finding of unconscionability Whenever it is claimed, or appears to the court, that a lease or any portion thereof is, or may have been, unconscionable at the time it was made, the parties shall be afforded a reasonable opportunity to present evidence at least as to\u2013 (1) the commercial setting of the negotiations; (2) whether a party has knowingly taken advantage of the inability of the other party reasonably to protect his interests; (3) the effect and purpose of the lease or portion of the lease or portion thereof, including its relationship to other contracts between the association, the unit owners and the developer or an affiliate of the developer; and (4) the disparity between the amount charged under the lease and the value of the real estate subject to the lease measured by the price at which similar real estate was readily obtainable in similar transactions. (d) Remedial relief; matters considered; attorneys' fees Upon finding that any lease, or portion thereof, is unconscionable, the court shall exercise its authority to grant remedial relief as necessary to avoid an unconscionable result, taking into consideration the economic value of the lease. Such relief may include, but shall not be limited to rescission, reformation, restitution, the award of damages and reasonable attorney fees and court costs. A defendant may recover reasonable attorneys' fees if the court determines that the cause of action filed by the plantiff\u00a01 is frivolous, malicious, or lacking in substantial merit. (e) Actions allowed after termination of special developer control Nothing in this section may be construed to authorize the bringing of an action by cooperative and condominium unit owners' association, seeking a judicial determination that a lease or leases, or portions thereof, are unconscionable, where such unit owners or a unit owners' association representing them has, after the termination of special developer control, reached an agreement with a holder of such lease or leases which either\u2014 (1) sets forth the terms and conditions under which such lease or leases is or shall be purchased by such unit owners or associations; or (2) reforms any clause in the lease which contained an automatic rent increase clause, unless such agreement was entered into when the leaseholder or his affiliate held a majority of the votes in the owners' association.\\n\\nTITLE 42\u2014THE PUBLIC HEALTH AND WELFARE, CHAPTER 77\u2014ENERGY CONSERVATION, SUBCHAPTER III\u2014IMPROVING ENERGY EFFICIENCY, \u00a76295.

Federal law generally does not cover this issue, as landlord-tenant relationships are primarily governed by state and local laws.\n\n### State and Local Laws\n\nTenant rights, including the right to repair or request repairs for air conditioning, are usually covered under state and local laws. These laws can vary widely from one jurisdiction to another. Some states require landlords to provide and maintain working air conditioning units, especially in regions where high temperatures can pose health risks. In other states, the obligation to repair or maintain air conditioning may depend on the terms of your lease agreement.\n\n### Lease Agreement\n\nYour lease agreement may also specify who is responsible for repairs to the air conditioning unit. Make sure to review your lease carefully to understand your rights and responsibilities.\n\n### Legal Advice\n\nIf you're facing issues with air conditioning repairs in your rental unit, you may want to consult with a legal expert familiar with landlord-tenant law in your jurisdiction to understand your rights and options.\n\nWould you like to know more about state-specific laws regarding this issue?"

Judicial determinations respecting unconscionable leases: (a) Lease characteristics; authorization by unit owners; conditions precedent to action Cooperative and condominium unit owners through the unit owners' association may bring an action seeking a judicial determination that a lease or leases, or portions thereof, were unconscionable at the time they were made. An action may be brought under this section if each such lease has all of the following characteristics: (1) it was made in connection with a cooperative or condominium project; (2) it was entered into while the cooperative or condominium owners' association was controlled by the developer either through special developer control or because the developer held a majority of the votes in the owners' association; (3) it had to be accepted or ratified by purchasers or through the unit owners' association as a condition of purchase of a unit in the cooperative or condominium project; (4) it is for a period of more than twenty-one years or is for a period of less than twenty-one years but contains automatic renewal provisions for a period of more than twenty-one years; (5) it contains an automatic rent increase clause; and (6) it was entered into prior to June 4, 1975. Such action must be authorized by the cooperative or condominium unit owners through a vote of not less than two-thirds of the owners of the units other than units owned by the developer or an affiliate of the developer, and may be brought by the cooperative or condominium unit owners through the units owners' association. Prior to instituting such action, the cooperative or condominium unit owners must, through a vote of not less than two-thirds of the owners of the units other than units owned by the developer or an affiliate of the developer, agree to enter into negotiation with the lessor and must seek through such negotiation to eliminate or modify any lease terms that are alleged to be unconscionable; if an agreement is not reached in ninety days from the date on which the authorizing vote was taken, the unit owners may authorize an action after following the procedure specified in the preceding sentence. (b) Presumption of unconscionability; rebuttal A rebuttal presumption of unconscionability exists if it is established that, in addition to the characteristics set forth in subsection (a) of this section, the lease\u2014 (1) creates a lien subjecting any unit to foreclosure for failure to make payments; (2) contains provisions requiring either the cooperative or condominium unit owners or the cooperative or condominium association as lessees to assume all or substantially all obligations and liabilities associated with the maintenance, management and use of the leased property, in addition to the obligation to make lease payments; (3) contains an automatic rent increase clause without establishing a specific maximum lease payment; and (4) requires an annual rental which exceeds 25 per centum of the appraised value of the leased property as improved: Provided, That, for purposes of this paragraph \\\"annual rental\\\" means the amount due during the first twelve months of the lease for all units, regardless of whether such units were occupied or sold during that period, and \\\"appraised value\\\" means the appraised value placed upon the leased property the first tax year after the sale of a unit in the condominium or after the sale of a membership or share interest in the cooperative association to a party who is not an affiliate of the developer. Once the rebuttable presumption is established, the court, in making its finding, shall consider the lease or portion of the lease to be unconscionable unless proven otherwise by the preponderance of the evidence to the contrary. (c) Presentation of evidence after finding of unconscionability Whenever it is claimed, or appears to the court, that a lease or any portion thereof is, or may have been, unconscionable at the time it was made, the parties shall be afforded a reasonable opportunity to present evidence at least as to\u2013 (1) the commercial setting of the negotiations; (2) whether a party has knowingly taken advantage of the inability of the other party reasonably to protect his interests; (3) the effect and purpose of the lease or portion of the lease or portion thereof, including its relationship to other contracts between the association, the unit owners and the developer or an affiliate of the developer; and (4) the disparity between the amount charged under the lease and the value of the real estate subject to the lease measured by the price at which similar real estate was readily obtainable in similar transactions. (d) Remedial relief; matters considered; attorneys' fees Upon finding that any lease, or portion thereof, is unconscionable, the court shall exercise its authority to grant remedial relief as necessary to avoid an unconscionable result, taking into consideration the economic value of the lease. Such relief may include, but shall not be limited to rescission, reformation, restitution, the award of damages and reasonable attorney fees and court costs. A defendant may recover reasonable attorneys' fees if the court determines that the cause of action filed by the plantiff\u00a01 is frivolous, malicious, or lacking in substantial merit. (e) Actions allowed after termination of special developer control Nothing in this section may be construed to authorize the bringing of an action by cooperative and condominium unit owners' association, seeking a judicial determination that a lease or leases, or portions thereof, are unconscionable, where such unit owners or a unit owners' association representing them has, after the termination of special developer control, reached an agreement with a holder of such lease or leases which either\u2014 (1) sets forth the terms and conditions under which such lease or leases is or shall be purchased by such unit owners or associations; or (2) reforms any clause in the lease which contained an automatic rent increase clause, unless such agreement was entered into when the leaseholder or his affiliate held a majority of the votes in the owners' association.\\n\\nTITLE 42\u2014THE PUBLIC HEALTH AND WELFARE, CHAPTER 77\u2014ENERGY CONSERVATION, SUBCHAPTER III\u2014IMPROVING ENERGY EFFICIENCY, \u00a76295.

                            "### Federal Law on Tenant Rights to Repair Air Conditioning\n\nThe federal law does not specifically address tenant rights concerning the repair of air conditioning units. Tenant-landlord laws are primarily governed by state and local laws, which can vary widely.\n\nHowever, federal law does cover general housing standards under the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). According to HUD, landlords are required to maintain rental properties to meet basic health and safety standards, but it does not specifically mention air conditioning.\n\nFor specific tenant rights related to air conditioning repairs, you would need to consult your state and local laws, as well as your rental agreement. Some states require landlords to provide and maintain air conditioning, while others do not. Your rental agreement may also outline responsibilities for repairs.\n\nWould you like to know more about tenant rights in a specific state?"

Void lease or contract provisions: Any provision in any lease or contract requiring unit owners or the owners' association, in any conversion project involving a contract meeting the requirements of section 3607 of this title of in any project involving a lease meeting the requirements of section 3608 of this title, to reimburse, regardless of outcome, the developer, his successor, or affiliate of the developer for attorneys' fees or money judgments, in a suit between unit owners or the owners' association and the developer arising under the lease or agreement, is against public policy and void.\\n\\nTITLE 15\u2014COMMERCE AND TRADE, CHAPTER 62\u2014CONDOMINIUM AND COOPERATIVE CONVERSION PROTECTION AND ABUSE RELIEF, , \u00a73608. Judicial determinations respecting unconscionable leases: (a) Lease characteristics; authorization by unit owners; conditions precedent to action Cooperative and condominium unit owners through the unit owners' association may bring an action seeking a judicial determination that a lease or leases, or portions thereof, were unconscionable at the time they were made. An action may be brought under this section if each such lease has all of the following characteristics: (1) it was made in connection with a cooperative or condominium project; (2) it was entered into while the cooperative or condominium owners' association was controlled by the developer either through special developer control or because the developer held a majority of the votes in the owners' association; (3) it had to be accepted or ratified by purchasers or through the unit owners' association as a condition of purchase of a unit in the cooperative or condominium project; (4) it is for a period of more than twenty-one years or is for a period of less than twenty-one years but contains automatic renewal provisions for a period of more than twenty-one years; (5) it contains an automatic rent increase clause; and (6) it was entered into prior to June 4, 1975. Such action must be authorized by the cooperative or condominium unit owners through a vote of not less than two-thirds of the owners of the units other than units owned by the developer or an affiliate of the developer, and may be brought by the cooperative or condominium unit owners through the units owners' association. Prior to instituting such action, the cooperative or condominium unit owners must, through a vote of not less than two-thirds of the owners of the units other than units owned by the developer or an affiliate of the developer, agree to enter into negotiation with the lessor and must seek through such negotiation to eliminate or modify any lease terms that are alleged to be unconscionable; if an agreement is not reached in ninety days from the date on which the authorizing vote was taken, the unit owners may authorize an action after following the procedure specified in the preceding sentence. (b) Presumption of unconscionability; rebuttal A rebuttal presumption of unconscionability exists if it is established that, in addition to the characteristics set forth in subsection (a) of this section, the lease\u2014 (1) creates a lien subjecting any unit to foreclosure for failure to make payments; (2) contains provisions requiring either the cooperative or condominium unit owners or the cooperative or condominium association as lessees to assume all or substantially all obligations and liabilities associated with the maintenance, management and use of the leased property, in addition to the obligation to make lease payments; (3) contains an automatic rent increase clause without establishing a specific maximum lease payment; and (4) requires an annual rental which exceeds 25 per centum of the appraised value of the leased property as improved: Provided, That, for purposes of this paragraph \\\"annual rental\\\" means the amount due during the first twelve months of the lease for all units, regardless of whether such units were occupied or sold during that period, and \\\"appraised value\\\" means the appraised value placed upon the leased property the first tax year after the sale of a unit in the condominium or after the sale of a membership or share interest in the cooperative association to a party who is not an affiliate of the developer. Once the rebuttable presumption is established, the court, in making its finding, shall consider the lease or portion of the lease to be unconscionable unless proven otherwise by the preponderance of the evidence to the contrary. (c) Presentation of evidence after finding of unconscionability Whenever it is claimed, or appears to the court, that a lease or any portion thereof is, or may have been, unconscionable at the time it was made, the parties shall be afforded a reasonable opportunity to present evidence at least as to\u2013 (1) the commercial setting of the negotiations; (2) whether a party has knowingly taken advantage of the inability of the other party reasonably to protect his interests; (3) the effect and purpose of the lease or portion of the lease or portion thereof, including its relationship to other contracts between the association, the unit owners and the developer or an affiliate of the developer; and (4) the disparity between the amount charged under the lease and the value of the real estate subject to the lease measured by the price at which similar real estate was readily obtainable in similar transactions. (d) Remedial relief; matters considered; attorneys' fees Upon finding that any lease, or portion thereof, is unconscionable, the court shall exercise its authority to grant remedial relief as necessary to avoid an unconscionable result, taking into consideration the economic value of the lease. Such relief may include, but shall not be limited to rescission, reformation, restitution, the award of damages and reasonable attorney fees and court costs. A defendant may recover reasonable attorneys' fees if the court determines that the cause of action filed by the plantiff\u00a01 is frivolous, malicious, or lacking in substantial merit. (e) Actions allowed after termination of special developer control Nothing in this section may be construed to authorize the bringing of an action by cooperative and condominium unit owners' association, seeking a judicial determination that a lease or leases, or portions thereof, are unconscionable, where such unit owners or a unit owners' association representing them has, after the termination of special developer control, reached an agreement with a holder of such lease or leases which either\u2014 (1) sets forth the terms and conditions under which such lease or leases is or shall be purchased by such unit owners or associations; or (2) reforms any clause in the lease which contained an automatic rent increase clause, unless such agreement was entered into when the leaseholder or his affiliate held a majority of the votes in the owners' association.\\n\\nTITLE 15\u2014COMMERCE AND TRADE, CHAPTER 62\u2014CONDOMINIUM AND COOPERATIVE CONVERSION PROTECTION AND ABUSE RELIEF, , \u00a73605. Notice of conversion and opportunity to purchase; responsibility of State and local governments: It is the sense of the Congress that, when multifamily rental housing projects are converted to condominium or cooperative use, tenants in those projects are entitled to adequate notice of the pending conversion and to receive the first opportunity to purchase units in the converted projects and that State and local governments which have not already provided for such notice and opportunity for purchase should move toward that end. The Congress believes it is the responsibility of State and local governments to provide for such notice and opportunity to purchase in a prompt manner. The Congress has decided not to intervene and therefore leaves this responsibility to State and local governments to be carried out.\\n\\nCite any applicable laws and include them in quotation marks \\\"\\\".

                            "An apartment complex operating at 100% capacity with a waiting list would generally be expected to have the financial resources to address maintenance and repair issues promptly. However, there are several reasons why repairs might still be delayed:\n\n### Operational Inefficiencies\n1. **Poor Management**: In some cases, the issue may be poor management rather than a lack of resources. Inefficient processes can slow down repair work.\n  \n2. **Vendor Issues**: The management might be dependent on third-party vendors for repairs, and any delays from their end would directly impact the tenants.\n\n### Financial Constraints\n1. **Cash Flow**: Even if the building is at full capacity, the management may have cash flow issues due to other financial obligations like loan repayments, taxes, or high operational costs.\n  \n2. **Budget Allocation**: Funds might be allocated for other projects or improvements, leaving less immediate availability for repairs.\n\n### Regulatory and Logistical Challenges\n1. **Permit Delays**: Some repairs may require permits that take time to secure.\n  \n2. **Seasonal Factors**: Weather conditions can affect the ability to make certain repairs.\n\n### Tenant-Related Factors\n1. **High Occupancy**: Ironically, a high occupancy rate could mean that the management is too busy with day-to-day operations to focus on long-term maintenance.\n  \n2. **Prioritization**: Management might prioritize issues that affect a larger number of tenants or pose immediate safety risks, leading to delays in addressing other concerns.\n\n### Resource Scarcity\n1. **Skilled Labor**: A shortage of skilled labor can also lead to delays.\n  \n2. **Material Shortages**: Sometimes, the necessary materials for repair are back-ordered or otherwise unavailable.\n\n### Communication Gap\n1. **Lack of Reporting**: Sometimes tenants don't report issues promptly, leading to delays.\n  \n2. **Internal Communication**: Poor communication within the management team can also result in delays.\n\nWhile these are some general reasons, the specific circumstances can vary widely from one property to another. If you're facing such issues, it might be helpful to communicate directly with the management or consider other avenues like tenant associations to address the concerns."

                            "Certainly! Here's a summary of the story of \"Blasphemous\":\n\nThe game is set in the fictional and nightmarish land of Cvstodia, a place cursed with eternal suffering. The protagonist, known as the Penitent One, is the last survivor of a group known as the Brotherhood of the Silent Sorrow. He wears a pointed helmet and wields a sword named Mea Culpa.\n\nThe Penitent One's journey is a pilgrimage to free the land from the curse and to seek redemption. Throughout his quest, he faces grotesque enemies and bosses, many of which are inspired by religious themes.\n\nThe overarching goal is to reach the Cradle of Affliction and confront the source of the curse, unraveling the twisted and dark lore of Cvstodia along the way. The game's narrative is cryptic and filled with symbolism, leaving much open to interpretation.\n\nVarious NPCs encountered throughout the game reveal more about the world, its history, and its characters. The Penitent One's path is filled with brutality, sacrifice, and penance, reflecting the game's grim aesthetic and themes.\n\nThere are different endings to the game, depending on the player's actions and choices throughout the journey, adding depth and replayability to the story.\n\nKeep in mind that \"Blasphemous\" is rich in imagery and themes, and the story may require some interpretation. Many of its elements are influenced by Spanish folklore, art, and religious iconography, adding complexity and nuance to the narrative."

These themes are common in various religious traditions and are often used to explore complex moral and spiritual questions.\n\nIn \"Blasphemous,\" these themes are exaggerated and intensified to create a grim and horrifying aesthetic. The game explores them in a fantastical setting, using them as a backdrop to the story and gameplay. While not a literal interpretation of the Bible, the game's use of these themes contributes to its dark and provocative atmosphere, drawing players into its twisted and unsettling world."

Here's an interpretation:\n\n- **\"The Eternal Dawn of our Penances, heralds its imminent end.\"**: This line may symbolize a prolonged period of suffering or atonement that is nearing its conclusion. The \"Eternal Dawn\" could represent a never-ending cycle or a new beginning in the context of penance.\n\n- **\"Each was born to put an end to the other.\"**: This could imply a central conflict or duality, possibly between two characters, forces, or ideas that are destined to oppose each other.\n\n- **\"Now both awake, but while yours slumbers, mine remains vigilant.\"**: This line might be contrasting the readiness or awareness of two opposing sides, perhaps indicating an advantage or a challenge to be overcome.\n\n- **\"May the miracle bear witness to this hour.\"**: The \"miracle\" may refer to a divine or supernatural force within the game's world, invoking its presence or judgment at a significant moment.\n\n- **\"By which I remain here for our long-awaited meeting, muted by the silence of the secret of existence.\"**: This seems to express anticipation for an important encounter or revelation, possibly between the speaker and the protagonist, or between conflicting forces. The reference to the \"secret of existence\" adds a layer of existential mystery or profundity.\n\nOverall, the passage appears to be setting the stage for a complex and dramatic struggle, filled with spiritual, existential, and philosophical themes. Without more context from the game itself, some of the specific meanings may remain ambiguous, but the tone and thematic content are rich and evocative."

                            "Considering the factors of cost, time efficiency, and access to a broad knowledge base and resources, here's a closer look at the two options that might best align with those criteria:\n\n1. **Custom Web Application using a CMS (e.g., WordPress)**:\n   - **Cost**: WordPress itself is free, and there are many free and paid plugins and themes available. Hosting can be found at various price points.\n   - **Time Efficiency**: With numerous pre-built themes and plugins, you can quickly set up the basic structure and then customize as needed.\n   - **Resources & Knowledge Base**: WordPress has a vast community, extensive documentation, and many online tutorials. AI tools like GPT-4 and Copilot can assist with custom coding.\n\n2. **Google Workspace with Google Apps Script**:\n   - **Cost**: Google Workspace offers free and paid plans. The free plan may be sufficient for individual use.\n   - **Time Efficiency**: Google Apps Script allows for quick scripting and automation within the familiar Google Docs, Sheets, and Drive environment.\n   - **Resources & Knowledge Base**: Google provides detailed documentation for Apps Script, and there's a strong community of developers. AI assistance can help with script development.\n\n**Recommendation**: If you're looking for the most cost-effective solution with a rich knowledge base, WordPress might be the better choice. It offers a wide range of free and paid resources, and the community support is extensive. You can start with a basic setup and then customize it with the help of AI tools like GPT-4 and Copilot.\n\nGoogle Workspace is also a strong option, especially if you prefer working within the Google ecosystem and need less extensive customization.\n\nBoth platforms offer a good balance of pre-built functionality and customization potential, allowing you to create a tailored solution for organizing digital resources. If you have any specific preferences or additional questions, please let me know!"

It's a versatile tool designed for note-taking, task management, and organization of various types of content. Here's how Notion can be geared towards your specific needs:\n\n1. **Content Organization**: Notion allows you to create pages, subpages, and databases to organize content by topics or projects. You can embed videos, links, images, and other media directly within pages.\n\n2. **Customization**: You can create custom templates and views to suit your specific organization style. While it may not offer the same level of code-level customization as WordPress, it provides a wide range of pre-built blocks and components to tailor the experience.\n\n3. **Accessibility**: Notion's user-friendly interface can be particularly beneficial for individuals with executive function disorder. The drag-and-drop functionality and visual organization tools make it easy to manage and retrieve information.\n\n4. **Collaboration**: If you need to share resources with others, Notion offers collaboration features, allowing multiple users to view and edit content.\n\n5. **Integration**: Notion integrates with various other tools and platforms, allowing you to pull in content from different sources.\n\n6. **Cost**: Notion offers a free plan with some limitations, and paid plans provide additional features and storage.\n\nWhile Notion may not offer the same depth of coding customization as a custom-built WordPress site or Google Apps Script, its user-friendly design and pre-built organization features make it a strong contender for your goals.\n\nIf the primary focus is on organizing digital resources in a way that's easily accessible and doesn't require extensive coding customization, Notion could be an excellent choice.

PARADIGMS\",\"description\":null,\"transcribed_part\":{\"0\":\"good morning everybody David Shapiro\",\"2\":\"here with another video\",\"4\":\"so uh I mentioned a few videos ago you\",\"7\":\"may or may not have seen it I mentioned\",\"8\":\"the concept of polymorphic applications\",\"11\":\"and a bunch of you are like what is this\",\"13\":\"concept tell me more and some people are\",\"15\":\"like yeah whatever that's not possible\",\"17\":\"so\",\"18\":\"this video is here to teach you a new\",\"22\":\"paradigm of software development and\",\"25\":\"software architecture so it's I call it\",\"28\":\"polymorphic applications or basically\",\"29\":\"self-changing applications\",\"32\":\"and we'll get right into it but first I\",\"36\":\"just wanted to say I am available I used\",\"39\":\"to do Consulting on patreon I still have\",\"41\":\"a few patreon clients there but I'm kind\",\"43\":\"of moving uh moving to more involved\",\"46\":\"engagements including strategic and\",\"49\":\"Technical Consulting teaching and\",\"51\":\"coaching as well as speaking engagements\",\"54\":\"so reach out to me on LinkedIn if you're\",\"56\":\"interested in any of these services and\",\"60\":\"then with all that back to the show\",\"62\":\"so a couple days ago uh Microsoft CEO\",\"66\":\"Satya Nadella at the Microsoft Inspire\",\"69\":\"2023 uh keynote basically said AI is\",\"74\":\"here and these are the new capabilities\",\"76\":\"because of language technology so the\",\"79\":\"two primary components that he outlined\",\"81\":\"were natural language interface so\",\"84\":\"that's the front end right voice chat\",\"86\":\"that sort of thing emails and then in\",\"89\":\"the back end you have what's called a\",\"91\":\"reasoning engine\",\"92\":\"and so what is a reasoning engine in\",\"95\":\"this case a reasoning engine is instead\",\"98\":\"of thinking about the language models as\",\"100\":\"something that just generates text right\",\"102\":\"A lot of people pick the low hanging\",\"104\":\"fruit let's use it to write emails let's\",\"106\":\"use it to write fiction uh you know\",\"108\":\"that's that's the obvious use case but\",\"110\":\"what's less obvious and this is what I\",\"112\":\"have been advocating for for literally\",\"113\":\"years uh when I wrote my initial book on\",\"116\":\"cognitive architecture natural language\",\"118\":\"cognitive architecture I said we have\",\"120\":\"invented a cognitive engine or a\",\"122\":\"reasoning engine he probably didn't use\",\"124\":\"cognitive engine because that's a very\",\"125\":\"anthropomorphic but it's a it's a\",\"128\":\"reasoning engine and so what does that\",\"129\":\"mean\",\"130\":\"language models uh are they're capable\",\"133\":\"of brainstorming and planning they're\",\"135\":\"capable of problem solving they're\",\"136\":\"capable of coding and testing code and\",\"138\":\"interpreting bugs they're also capable\",\"141\":\"of choosing and deciding or making\",\"143\":\"decisions and so these are all elements\",\"146\":\"of cognition and this is why I have been\",\"149\":\"focusing on cognitive architecture for\",\"151\":\"the last four years\",\"153\":\"so also the keynote was really good you\",\"155\":\"should watch it if you haven't\",\"156\":\"especially if you're if you're whether\",\"158\":\"you're an investor in this space or a\",\"161\":\"startup founder or a product owner if\",\"164\":\"you are doing anything with generative\",\"166\":\"AI you need to watch that keynote speech\",\"170\":\"Okay so\",\"172\":\"I promised polymorphic applications but\",\"175\":\"really one thing that you need to become\",\"177\":\"more familiar with is what I call\",\"178\":\"Mission oriented programming so this is\",\"181\":\"the next Paradigm Beyond object oriented\",\"184\":\"programming instead we instead of\",\"186\":\"thinking of objects we now have to think\",\"188\":\"of missions uh as the as the primary\",\"191\":\"organizing feature of this new software\",\"193\":\"Paradigm and so let me just read the\",\"196\":\"definition a mission oriented\",\"198\":\"programming is a paradigm in software\",\"199\":\"development where applications are\",\"201\":\"primarily designed and built around a\",\"203\":\"clear measurable and purposeful Mission\",\"205\":\"and I'll give you some examples in a\",\"207\":\"little bit don't panic\",\"208\":\"the mission serves as the core driver of\",\"211\":\"the software's behavior adaptation and\",\"213\":\"evolution these applications often\",\"215\":\"referred to as polymorphic applications\",\"216\":\"are not just tools but active agents in\",\"219\":\"pursuing their respective Mission and so\",\"221\":\"then there's a few components of this\",\"222\":\"one mission-centric design number two\",\"226\":\"autonomy and agency the ability to make\",\"228\":\"decisions uh in pursuit of that mission\",\"231\":\"uh there's needs to be adaptability and\",\"234\":\"flexibility hence the polymorphic aspect\",\"236\":\"Dynamic tool creation if it needs a tool\",\"239\":\"it can make the tool and then on the\",\"242\":\"lower level uh how do you actually allow\",\"245\":\"the the the application to change itself\",\"247\":\"you use micro Frameworks configurable\",\"250\":\"front ends and configurable back-ends uh\",\"253\":\"okay cool so I just threw a lot at you\",\"255\":\"um you're probably like what what are\",\"257\":\"you talking about uh you know\",\"261\":\"think about it this way this is how we\",\"262\":\"got here\",\"263\":\"llms can write code they can solve\",\"266\":\"problems they can make decisions they\",\"267\":\"can write unit tests they can write user\",\"269\":\"stories so extrapolate that out as far\",\"272\":\"as possible you have an llm that can do\",\"274\":\"all of these things one at a time what\",\"276\":\"if you stack them all together so\",\"278\":\"another way to think about it a simpler\",\"281\":\"way to think about it is generative AI\",\"284\":\"or llms or whatever they're just a type\",\"286\":\"of automation so if you're an\",\"288\":\"infrastructure engineer an I.T guy or a\",\"290\":\"software Dev or a software architecture\",\"292\":\"software architect just think about\",\"294\":\"generative AI as just another kind of\",\"296\":\"automation that's it automation\",\"299\":\"automation automation that's all you\",\"301\":\"need to think about it is it gives you\",\"303\":\"some new capabilities in the automation\",\"306\":\"name of the game but it's still just\",\"309\":\"fundamentally a kind of automation it's\",\"311\":\"that simple\",\"313\":\"okay so when we talk about this\",\"315\":\"automation engine or this reasoning\",\"317\":\"engine like what things can it automate\",\"319\":\"so first think about how openai just\",\"322\":\"came out with function calling and API\",\"324\":\"use so basically that means that the\",\"328\":\"that your llm your generative AI model\",\"330\":\"is universal middleware it can talk to\",\"333\":\"anything in your organization anything\",\"335\":\"in your Tech stack as long as it's got\",\"337\":\"an API\",\"338\":\"so because of that it can touch\",\"339\":\"everything\",\"341\":\"it's capable of problem solving there\",\"343\":\"are many times where you just plug in\",\"345\":\"like an error code or you know describe\",\"348\":\"something that you're that you're\",\"350\":\"getting and it can understand it it's\",\"352\":\"not always right but it can also\",\"354\":\"understand when it's getting it wrong\",\"356\":\"and kind of stop and you know you can\",\"358\":\"use tree of thought or Chain of Thought\",\"359\":\"or whatever there's all kinds of problem\",\"361\":\"solving uh techniques out there tree of\",\"364\":\"thought by the way increases problem\",\"366\":\"solving capabilities by like 900 or\",\"369\":\"uh so if it can solve problems that\",\"372\":\"means it can overcome problems\",\"373\":\"automatically decision making so here's\",\"376\":\"the thing is with with a given objective\",\"378\":\"or a mission it can make decisions in\",\"381\":\"pursuit of that mission and this is why\",\"384\":\"I say Mission uh oriented uh programming\",\"387\":\"and so then of course planning and\",\"389\":\"brainstorming which is also required for\",\"391\":\"to pursue a any given Mission so if you\",\"395\":\"have an automation engine that is\",\"396\":\"capable of these things now what can you\",\"399\":\"do with this now that it's in your\",\"400\":\"toolbox\",\"402\":\"so one of the first things that you need\",\"404\":\"to think about and to kind of change\",\"407\":\"your mind is on-demand tools or tools\",\"409\":\"that make tools a tool Factory because\",\"411\":\"that's what that I mean that's what GPT\",\"414\":\"does with code it generates new code and\",\"417\":\"what is code but it's a software tool\",\"419\":\"and so you know you think about it like\",\"422\":\"the replicator from Star Trek computer I\",\"424\":\"need something that does X Y and Z and\",\"426\":\"you know a few seconds later it pops out\",\"428\":\"so if you think about the first step\",\"431\":\"towards building polymorphic\",\"433\":\"applications uh the first step towards\",\"435\":\"Mission oriented programming is the\",\"437\":\"ability to synthesize any code object\",\"440\":\"that you need on the Fly and so if it\",\"443\":\"can write code it can test code it can\",\"445\":\"call apis it can read the manual I can\",\"448\":\"write user stories it can read epics it\",\"450\":\"can do all of that stuff you combine all\",\"452\":\"that together and you create an\",\"454\":\"automated tool Factory or a replicator\",\"456\":\"this is the first step in creating\",\"458\":\"polymorphic applications because you can\",\"461\":\"you can stack the blocks together\",\"463\":\"but you need something to make to print\",\"465\":\"the blocks for you right it's like a 3D\",\"466\":\"printer or a replicator but for code and\",\"470\":\"so then once all the blocks are you know\",\"472\":\"you've got a block Factory a tool\",\"474\":\"Factory now you can just plug them all\",\"476\":\"together you may you aim for Plug and\",\"478\":\"Play architecture plugable architecture\",\"480\":\"and from there you know because it's got\",\"483\":\"access to literally every API in your\",\"485\":\"organization it can talk to Azure AWS\",\"487\":\"Google Cloud\",\"489\":\"VMware Microsoft whatever it can talk to\",\"492\":\"everything in your organization as long\",\"494\":\"as it's got an API then you build those\",\"497\":\"building blocks and then you stack them\",\"499\":\"together and what can you do with Legos\",\"501\":\"you can do anything with Legos as long\",\"504\":\"as you've got enough blocks so I think\",\"506\":\"you're kind of getting the picture is\",\"508\":\"that if you think about it in terms of\",\"509\":\"modularity or individual pieces that can\",\"511\":\"be kind of printed or fabricated on\",\"514\":\"demand and then you plug them together\",\"516\":\"that is the underpinning\",\"518\":\"mentality of polymorphic applications\",\"521\":\"it's polymorphic because it can change\",\"523\":\"shapes because all the all the\",\"525\":\"pieces all the underlying pieces are\",\"527\":\"just plug and play\",\"528\":\"okay so we talked about Mission earlier\",\"531\":\"but who runs the show you've got a whole\",\"534\":\"bunch of blocks a whole bunch of\",\"535\":\"building blocks but how do you how does\",\"537\":\"the machine know what to plug into what\",\"539\":\"and and that sort of thing you need a\",\"541\":\"brain right you've got the tool Factory\",\"543\":\"okay great uh and at first it's going to\",\"546\":\"be humans asking for tools you know\",\"548\":\"replicator you know you know tea Earl\",\"550\":\"Gray hot right but\",\"552\":\"what you need to do is ultimately\",\"554\":\"automate as much of that as possible so\",\"557\":\"the tool Factory is automated but then\",\"558\":\"you need to automate the thing that's\",\"560\":\"asking for the tools and the tool and\",\"561\":\"the and the building blocks this is\",\"564\":\"called a cognitive architecture\",\"566\":\"so remember going back to Sachin\",\"567\":\"nadella's point that we have a reasoning\",\"569\":\"engine or a cognitive engine or an\",\"571\":\"automation engine whatever you want to\",\"572\":\"call it it's all the same thing\",\"574\":\"cognition reasoning automation all the\",\"577\":\"same thing now let's dive into cognitive\",\"579\":\"architecture\",\"580\":\"so many of you that have been following\",\"582\":\"my channel for a long time know that I\",\"584\":\"am like the cognitive architecture guy I\",\"586\":\"wrote natural language cognitive\",\"587\":\"architecture more than two years ago now\",\"589\":\"this is my shtix This Is My Jam now what\",\"593\":\"was missing from my books in the past\",\"594\":\"was a more coherent framework I had some\",\"597\":\"diagrams I had some architectural\",\"599\":\"recommendations and a lot of people get\",\"601\":\"a lot out of it but this is like the OSI\",\"604\":\"model but for next-gen applications for\",\"607\":\"polymorphic application so I call it the\",\"609\":\"ace model autonomous cognitive entities\",\"612\":\"so again right there in the name\",\"614\":\"autonomous the idea is to create\",\"616\":\"something that has a higher degree of\",\"618\":\"autonomy but it also uses cognition it\",\"621\":\"uses reasoning and then it's an entity\",\"623\":\"in that it is somewhat self-contained\",\"626\":\"now some people are going to be\",\"627\":\"deploying a generative AI in a more\",\"630\":\"distributed sense and that's not what\",\"631\":\"this video is about this video is about\",\"633\":\"basically the architecture to create\",\"635\":\"commander data or you know bd1 or\",\"638\":\"whatever right if you want to create\",\"639\":\"C-3PO or R2D2 this is the architecture\",\"643\":\"uh the the Paradigm the framework the\",\"646\":\"conceptual framework that you need to\",\"648\":\"implement so without further Ado it is\",\"650\":\"six layers that might change but um I've\",\"653\":\"been working on this for a while so I'm\",\"655\":\"pretty sure I've got it nailed down so\",\"657\":\"the first layer is the aspirational\",\"659\":\"layer this is the layer that is\",\"661\":\"concerned with the mission the values\",\"662\":\"the purpose the ethics and the morals of\",\"666\":\"whatever it is that you're building and\",\"668\":\"like I said we'll get in we'll I'll give\",\"670\":\"you some examples of missions in just a\",\"672\":\"minute so that it'll make more sense\",\"674\":\"the layer 2 is the global strategy layer\",\"676\":\"this is long-term thinking context\",\"678\":\"context is the primary thing for Layer\",\"680\":\"Two and it's basically like a CEO it\",\"682\":\"says okay here's you know I have I have\",\"685\":\"my vision I have my morals right my my\",\"687\":\"higher order beliefs\",\"689\":\"now what is the biggest time Horizon way\",\"693\":\"to think about that mission\",\"696\":\"layer 3 is Agent model so this is the\",\"698\":\"self model and it's primarily concerned\",\"700\":\"with capabilities the machine has to\",\"703\":\"know what it is how it works and what\",\"704\":\"it's capable of in order to make\",\"706\":\"decisions because if you tell a machine\",\"708\":\"hey go solve world hunger it's like okay\",\"710\":\"cool well I'm gonna go plant a bunch of\",\"712\":\"fields it's like well actually you've\",\"714\":\"only got a budget of fifty dollars right\",\"715\":\"and and you've got one hand then and\",\"717\":\"it's tied behind your back right so by\",\"720\":\"understanding what the model is capable\",\"722\":\"of or your engine or your architecture\",\"724\":\"it has to know what it is capable of and\",\"726\":\"what it's not capable of\",\"729\":\"it also has to be capable of changing\",\"731\":\"itself so this is where the the\",\"732\":\"polymorphic thing comes in if it\",\"734\":\"understands that it has a limitation\",\"736\":\"such as like well I don't have access to\",\"738\":\"that API I need to get access to that\",\"740\":\"API\",\"741\":\"um how do I get access to that do I send\",\"743\":\"a ticket to the help desk and they'll\",\"745\":\"give me permission or is it something\",\"747\":\"that I can solve on my own that sort of\",\"749\":\"thing so you need a very comprehensive\",\"751\":\"agent model in order for the machine to\",\"754\":\"be able to change itself\",\"756\":\"um in in alignment with pursuing its\",\"759\":\"Mission and so you're probably got some\",\"761\":\"alarm Bells\",\"762\":\"pinging because you're like Dave you're\",\"765\":\"basically designing Skynet which is\",\"766\":\"exactly why the aspirational layer is at\",\"769\":\"the very top those those constraints\",\"771\":\"those boundaries the missions the values\",\"774\":\"the purpose this is around this is what\",\"776\":\"it what you know sets the tone The\",\"778\":\"Guiding North Star of the device so that\",\"782\":\"it never fully goes off the rails but\",\"784\":\"you need something that is constantly\",\"786\":\"watching you know it's it's the ideal\",\"788\":\"self and we'll dive into each of these\",\"789\":\"layers in just a minute but I wanted to\",\"790\":\"give you the whole framework at a high\",\"793\":\"level overview So Below the agent model\",\"795\":\"is the executive function so this is\",\"798\":\"primarily concerned with planning or\",\"799\":\"making plans so that means like\",\"802\":\"forecasting like okay what's going to go\",\"803\":\"wrong how do I think through this\",\"805\":\"directives oh and you know the The\",\"807\":\"Prompt engineering is already there\",\"809\":\"let's think through this step by step\",\"810\":\"right take that out to the nth degree\",\"812\":\"that's the executive function layer this\",\"815\":\"is also concerned with resources\",\"817\":\"so if you make a plan you have to know\",\"819\":\"what resources are available to you and\",\"821\":\"these are external resources right the\",\"823\":\"agent model in terms of capabilities\",\"825\":\"that is internal resources this is what\",\"827\":\"I am capable of in the world but then\",\"830\":\"executive function for planning is about\",\"832\":\"external resources how much compute do I\",\"835\":\"need what kind of developers need to\",\"837\":\"help me\",\"838\":\"um what kind of access do I need what\",\"839\":\"kind of data do I need from the outside\",\"841\":\"world and so then once you get a plan\",\"843\":\"together you get the blueprint you get\",\"845\":\"the the burn down chart or however you\",\"847\":\"want to organize it your kanban board\",\"849\":\"your jira board right because that's\",\"851\":\"basically what you're interacting with\",\"853\":\"here at the executive function layer\",\"855\":\"below that is cognitive control\",\"857\":\"cognitive control is saying okay here's\",\"859\":\"the big plan now what so this is about a\",\"863\":\"task selection and task switching so\",\"866\":\"that means choosing the correct order of\",\"868\":\"operations and then but more importantly\",\"871\":\"choosing when to switch tasks because if\",\"874\":\"something isn't working or you or you\",\"875\":\"started a task and then it's not the\",\"877\":\"right order of operations or you realize\",\"879\":\"that you've come into a barrier you need\",\"881\":\"to back out of that task and choose a\",\"883\":\"different one and so that is driven by\",\"886\":\"frustration signals and cognitive\",\"888\":\"damping which we'll get into in just a\",\"889\":\"moment and then finally layer six is\",\"892\":\"Task prosecution which is doing one task\",\"894\":\"at a time but more importantly detecting\",\"897\":\"when that task is is truly successful or\",\"900\":\"has failed and then reporting that\",\"902\":\"information back up to the cognitive\",\"903\":\"control layer which will then adjust the\",\"906\":\"frustration and damping signals okay so\",\"908\":\"let's get into these layers a little bit\",\"910\":\"deeper number one the aspirational layer\",\"913\":\"it's all about Mission I'll just read\",\"914\":\"the description to you this is the\",\"917\":\"uppermost layer which is somewhat\",\"918\":\"abstracted and detached this is the\",\"920\":\"ideal cell for superego version of the\",\"923\":\"agent which keeps track of the highest\",\"925\":\"values virtues principles vision and\",\"927\":\"mission of the agent in other words this\",\"929\":\"sets the tone for all other layers below\",\"931\":\"it in other words sorry I meant that I\",\"934\":\"didn't use that twice this serves as the\",\"936\":\"moral compass and The Guiding North Star\",\"937\":\"for the autonomous cognitive entity for\",\"939\":\"the ace it provides the raise and Detra\",\"942\":\"and I'm no I didn't say that right but\",\"944\":\"the reason for being it is this layer\",\"946\":\"also serves as the ultimate orbital\",\"948\":\"Arbiter for all moral dilemmas\",\"950\":\"that that thing faces and so what I mean\",\"953\":\"by that is here's some examples of\",\"955\":\"submissions that you might give so for\",\"958\":\"lawyers\",\"959\":\"um this is this is set by uh the ethical\",\"961\":\"standards and and uh regulations and\",\"964\":\"whatever uh but the the mission of a\",\"966\":\"lawyer is to zealously advocate for\",\"968\":\"their client that is the highest mission\",\"970\":\"of a lawyer for doctors achieve the best\",\"973\":\"possible Health outcome for their\",\"975\":\"patient so these are these are examples\",\"977\":\"of aspirational missions that\",\"979\":\"um that that Central Mission informs\",\"981\":\"every decision that they make including\",\"984\":\"all moral decisions all ethical\",\"986\":\"decisions uh it it also speaks to how\",\"989\":\"they allocate their time energy and\",\"991\":\"resources and so by having a centrally\",\"993\":\"organizing mission that mission-oriented\",\"996\":\"programming you embed that at the\",\"998\":\"highest level or the the the heart the\",\"1000\":\"core of your autonomous cognitive entity\",\"1003\":\"and it will pursue that mission\",\"1005\":\"uh and then any decisions that it makes\",\"1007\":\"will be uh with respect to and in\",\"1010\":\"pursuit of in honor of that mission and\",\"1014\":\"that's why defining missions is really\",\"1016\":\"super critical just below that is global\",\"1019\":\"strategy which is all about context so\",\"1022\":\"Global context World State and long-term\",\"1024\":\"strategic thinking this has the greatest\",\"1026\":\"time Horizon\",\"1028\":\"um and the greatest physical uh scope as\",\"1031\":\"well so for instance if you've got a\",\"1033\":\"lawyer robot or a a doctor robot it\",\"1037\":\"needs to not just be thinking about the\",\"1039\":\"hospital that it works in or the law\"},\"channel_name\":\"David Shapiro ~

PARADIGMS\",\"description\":null,\"transcribed_part\":{\"1040\":\"firm that it works in it needs to be\",\"1042\":\"thinking about the entire context of\",\"1044\":\"okay what's going on with uh you know\",\"1047\":\"medical research in the entire world\",\"1049\":\"what is the status quo what is the news\",\"1051\":\"what is happening in the marketplace\",\"1054\":\"what is happening in our competitors\",\"1056\":\"that sort of thing and so you think\",\"1059\":\"about this as the CEO of your autonomous\",\"1061\":\"cognitive entity it it maintains a very\",\"1064\":\"high level perspective\",\"1066\":\"um and it kind of has keeps it at arm's\",\"1068\":\"length so again it's not going to get\",\"1070\":\"lost in the weeds just like any CEO\",\"1072\":\"should not be lost in the weeds they\",\"1074\":\"need to be looking up and out not down\",\"1077\":\"and in so this layer of your autonomous\",\"1080\":\"cognitive entity is it is anchored to\",\"1083\":\"the real world because remember the\",\"1084\":\"aspirational layer is this is more\",\"1086\":\"abstract and conceptual this is not\",\"1088\":\"really anchored to the real world this\",\"1090\":\"is anchored to principles values mission\",\"1093\":\"that sort of stuff this is the first\",\"1096\":\"layer the global strategy layer is the\",\"1097\":\"first one that is anchored to the real\",\"1099\":\"world but it has a Global Perspective\",\"1101\":\"and it also has a long-term perspective\",\"1103\":\"it's not thinking about today and\",\"1105\":\"tomorrow it's thinking about a decade\",\"1107\":\"from now it's thinking about a century\",\"1108\":\"from now it's also looking at the entire\",\"1110\":\"planet Earth and then if you know we\",\"1112\":\"expand beyond Earth it'll be thinking\",\"1114\":\"about the entire sphere of human\",\"1115\":\"existence the entire universe the entire\",\"1118\":\"Cosmos so you maintain that big\",\"1120\":\"perspective in order to um you know\",\"1123\":\"start the start the process of zooming\",\"1125\":\"in and you'll notice that that each\",\"1127\":\"subsequent layer Zooms in further and\",\"1128\":\"further and further so we start super\",\"1131\":\"high level super detached and then we\",\"1133\":\"zoom in uh progressively with each layer\",\"1136\":\"so this has to do with World State as\",\"1138\":\"well all right I think you get the idea\",\"1140\":\"so let's move on agent model agent model\",\"1143\":\"is all about capabilities this is the\",\"1145\":\"ego of the of the machine it this is\",\"1147\":\"what it knows and believes about itself\",\"1149\":\"now I know that this sounds a very\",\"1152\":\"anthropomorphic but again you know we're\",\"1154\":\"talking about cognitive entities here\",\"1156\":\"we're talking about reasoning engines\",\"1157\":\"this is the layer that confers\",\"1159\":\"functional sentience this is the first\",\"1161\":\"layer where your uh your software\",\"1164\":\"architecture knows that it is a software\",\"1166\":\"architecture and it knows how it's\",\"1168\":\"configured it knows what it's capable of\",\"1170\":\"it understands its operational\",\"1172\":\"conditions how many servers are running\",\"1174\":\"it uh if it's on one piece of Hardware\",\"1176\":\"it needs to know the voltage and\",\"1177\":\"temperature and all that other kind of\",\"1179\":\"stuff so this is self-referential\",\"1181\":\"information what is it like basically\",\"1184\":\"the question is what am I capable of how\",\"1186\":\"am I built what can I do what can't I do\",\"1188\":\"what am I allowed to change about myself\",\"1191\":\"what can I change about myself what\",\"1193\":\"functions are autonomics so for instance\",\"1195\":\"if you have a bunch of models that are\",\"1198\":\"just learning on online all the time it\",\"1200\":\"needs to understand that and so that it\",\"1202\":\"could steer those models learning you\",\"1204\":\"probably will use frozen models at first\",\"1206\":\"because you don't want the thing you\",\"1208\":\"know having a complex set of\",\"1209\":\"interactions and learning stuff that you\",\"1211\":\"weren't aware of\",\"1213\":\"but in the long run these things will be\",\"1215\":\"uh basically curating their own internal\",\"1218\":\"architecture their own internal library\",\"1220\":\"of models that sort of stuff but this is\",\"1223\":\"fundamentally about capabilities what am\",\"1225\":\"I capable of what do I need to be\",\"1227\":\"capable of what am I not capable of and\",\"1230\":\"this uh this level of zooming in is\",\"1233\":\"saying okay given my my mission my\",\"1236\":\"purpose and given the global context of\",\"1239\":\"what's going on in the world what am I\",\"1240\":\"capable of how can what like what is\",\"1243\":\"within the realm of possibility for me\",\"1245\":\"to pursue that mission and so by\",\"1248\":\"couching all this within that agent\",\"1250\":\"model it's like okay well you know my my\",\"1253\":\"goal like the goal that I was given is\",\"1255\":\"you know conquer the world but I'm\",\"1257\":\"running on you know an Intel Pentium\",\"1258\":\"three so my resources are limited so\",\"1261\":\"maybe I need to get more more resources\",\"1263\":\"and I'll have to beg beg borrow or steal\",\"1266\":\"them or whatever obviously don't give\",\"1268\":\"your agent uh the the goal of Conquering\",\"1270\":\"the world we already tried that with\",\"1272\":\"chaos GPT don't do it again let's let's\",\"1274\":\"stick with something a little bit more\",\"1276\":\"constructive\",\"1277\":\"the next layer is executive function so\",\"1280\":\"this is a this is primarily about\",\"1281\":\"planning uh you know whether so once you\",\"1285\":\"have once you have the mission you've\",\"1287\":\"got the vision and you've got the global\",\"1289\":\"context and then you know what you're\",\"1290\":\"capable of with all of that in in mind\",\"1293\":\"you're then able to say okay well you\",\"1296\":\"know I've got access to you know so so\",\"1298\":\"and so internal resources this is what's\",\"1300\":\"going on in the world okay cool now\",\"1302\":\"let's come up with a with a plan to\",\"1304\":\"actually make it happen and so you can\",\"1306\":\"think about this as a little miniature\",\"1308\":\"internal project manager or or a\",\"1310\":\"director right so it's you know CEO and\",\"1313\":\"then you got like director or PM or\",\"1315\":\"program owner or whatever right but it's\",\"1318\":\"fundamentally about like okay let's\",\"1319\":\"think through this whole thing end to\",\"1321\":\"end let's come up with a plan to do this\",\"1323\":\"and remember large language models are\",\"1324\":\"great at it if you don't believe me go\",\"1326\":\"to chat gbt right now and tell it a\",\"1328\":\"problem give it give it everything that\",\"1330\":\"I just in the upper layers and say come\",\"1332\":\"up with a plan and you'll see that it\",\"1333\":\"can do it\",\"1334\":\"okay so once you uh what goes into the\",\"1338\":\"plan though so you you have to think\",\"1339\":\"into the future right okay so you\",\"1341\":\"forecast like what are the choke points\",\"1343\":\"what are the points of failure\",\"1345\":\"um what's going to be happening uh what\",\"1347\":\"resources do I need and so this is\",\"1349\":\"really critical remember I was talking\",\"1350\":\"about external resources what kind of\",\"1352\":\"help am I going to need how many parts\",\"1354\":\"materials money energy whatever data so\",\"1358\":\"this is where this is the layer where\",\"1359\":\"it's like okay let's let's scrape\",\"1361\":\"together a specific project plan for\",\"1364\":\"this exact project whatever it whatever\",\"1366\":\"it's going to come up with in order to\",\"1368\":\"pursue that given mission\",\"1371\":\"below that is cognitive control so\",\"1373\":\"cognitive control is fundamentally about\",\"1374\":\"focus it says okay we've got the plan\",\"1377\":\"we've got the mission I know what I'm\",\"1378\":\"capable of\",\"1379\":\"now what do I do what is the correct\",\"1382\":\"order of operations here so this is Task\",\"1384\":\"selection and task switching and so if\",\"1387\":\"you've got really bad ADHD then your\",\"1390\":\"brain will switch tasks on you uh\",\"1392\":\"without you without your consent\",\"1395\":\"um and so that is that is an executive\",\"1396\":\"dysfunction that happens in humans and\",\"1398\":\"as people have noticed executive\",\"1400\":\"dysfunction is really common in these\",\"1402\":\"language models because they'll just\",\"1403\":\"they'll they'll uh they'll contact\",\"1405\":\"switch without you telling it because\",\"1407\":\"they're they don't they don't have it so\",\"1409\":\"this layer is about giving it that that\",\"1413\":\"cognitive control so that it doesn't\",\"1415\":\"context switch or task switch unless and\",\"1418\":\"until it's ready or it's supposed to so\",\"1421\":\"this layer is uh most going to be most\",\"1424\":\"familiar to people who are familiar with\",\"1426\":\"a term called finite State machines so\",\"1429\":\"basically a finite State machine says\",\"1431\":\"you're doing one of any number of tasks\",\"1433\":\"you're and and so this is really common\",\"1435\":\"in robotics and NPCs and video games you\",\"1439\":\"for an MPC you might be fighting you\",\"1441\":\"might be running you might be hiding you\",\"1443\":\"might be searching so there's a finite\",\"1445\":\"number of states that you can be in or\",\"1447\":\"there's a finite number of tasks you can\",\"1449\":\"pick from from the plant the project\",\"1451\":\"plan above\",\"1453\":\"so what whatever state the machine is in\",\"1456\":\"you have to switch between those States\",\"1458\":\"and say okay right now I'm writing code\",\"1460\":\"then I'm going to switch to testing code\",\"1462\":\"then I'm going to switch to\",\"1465\":\"um doing integration testing then I'm\",\"1466\":\"going to switch to deployment right so\",\"1469\":\"this is that is what cognitive control\",\"1471\":\"is about it is about task switching task\",\"1473\":\"selection and then it's driven in part\",\"1476\":\"by so from above it's driven by the\",\"1479\":\"project plan from below it's driven by\",\"1481\":\"frustration and damping so frustration\",\"1483\":\"is very simple frustration is simply\",\"1485\":\"just keeping track of the rate of\",\"1487\":\"failures versus the rate of successes if\",\"1490\":\"the rate of failures is too high then\",\"1492\":\"you've got the wrong plan and that means\",\"1494\":\"you need to go up a layer and the and\",\"1496\":\"the executive function layer says well\",\"1498\":\"this plan isn't working let's make a new\",\"1500\":\"plan right so that's where frustration\",\"1502\":\"comes in because if if if everything\",\"1504\":\"you're trying and 75 of it is failing\",\"1506\":\"you're probably got the wrong plan so\",\"1508\":\"you need to go up and and kind of\",\"1510\":\"re-strategize and reallocate resources\",\"1512\":\"and fee that information back in I cover\",\"1515\":\"all this in my book um uh Symphony of\",\"1517\":\"thought by the way where I I give plenty\",\"1519\":\"of examples of how to achieve each of\",\"1521\":\"these steps with prompt engineering\",\"1524\":\"uh damping is so cognitive damping is\",\"1528\":\"basically okay let's pump the brakes\",\"1530\":\"let's try and prove ourselves wrong\",\"1532\":\"right like okay let's let's think\",\"1534\":\"through this let's do\",\"1536\":\"um like what could go wrong here uh\",\"1538\":\"let's let's think about uh failure\",\"1540\":\"points let's think about is this is this\",\"1543\":\"a step that we're gonna regret if it\",\"1545\":\"goes wrong do we have a back out\",\"1546\":\"strategy so cognitive damping is about\",\"1549\":\"slowing down and thinking through things\",\"1551\":\"a little bit more deliberately so that\",\"1553\":\"you don't make any grievous mistakes in\",\"1555\":\"the context of uh medical uh medical\",\"1558\":\"robot it's like okay if I make this\",\"1561\":\"incision there's no turning back right\",\"1563\":\"and so cognitive damping says let's stop\",\"1566\":\"let's check like let's dot all of our\",\"1568\":\"eyes and cross all of our T's to make\",\"1570\":\"sure that we're going to do this right\",\"1572\":\"and make sure that we're ready to do\",\"1574\":\"this so that's what cognitive damping is\",\"1575\":\"and again this is all pretty easy to put\",\"1578\":\"into\",\"1579\":\"um prompt engineering uh so those two\",\"1581\":\"things uh frustration and damping are\",\"1584\":\"two of the big biggest tacket tactics\",\"1586\":\"for maintaining focus on what you're\",\"1589\":\"doing and why at any given moment and\",\"1591\":\"then the very bottom layer is Task\",\"1593\":\"prosecution so this is tasks this is the\",\"1595\":\"low level Hands-On product task\",\"1599\":\"so this could be the robotic command of\",\"1601\":\"go from A to B it could be you know\",\"1604\":\"right X number of code or send an API\",\"1607\":\"call to to you know there and this is\",\"1609\":\"something that happens all of these\",\"1611\":\"things happen in your brain and it's\",\"1613\":\"completely transparent right so imagine\",\"1615\":\"you go to this happens to me all the\",\"1617\":\"time\",\"1618\":\"um I get home and I forget that I lock\",\"1621\":\"the door so the task is open the door so\",\"1624\":\"I go and reach for the door and it\",\"1625\":\"doesn't turn oh right I locked it so\",\"1627\":\"that's exactly what I mean by low level\",\"1629\":\"tasks success or failure and so then\",\"1632\":\"it's like okay my brain gets the signal\",\"1634\":\"door didn't open right let's back up a\",\"1636\":\"level so my cognitive control switches\",\"1638\":\"from open the door to get the keys out\",\"1641\":\"of my pocket and then try again so by by\",\"1644\":\"focusing on this layer of of success or\",\"1647\":\"failure of one task at a time then you\",\"1651\":\"have that information available and you\",\"1653\":\"pass it back up the stack\",\"1655\":\"um in in the case of a robotic right\",\"1657\":\"example it's like okay get from the\",\"1660\":\"living room to the kitchen and then it\",\"1662\":\"gets stuck because it's like oh well\",\"1663\":\"there's a dog you know laying my dog\",\"1666\":\"does this all the time lays right in the\",\"1668\":\"middle of the path I can't so now now\",\"1670\":\"I've got a new problem right\",\"1672\":\"and so it's like okay well getting from\",\"1674\":\"the living room to the kitchen failed\",\"1675\":\"because there's a dog in the way so you\",\"1677\":\"pass that back up to cognitive control\",\"1678\":\"it says oh let's let's switch switch\",\"1681\":\"states to now I need to ask the dog to\",\"1683\":\"get out of the way or ask the human to\",\"1684\":\"get the dog out of the way right okay so\",\"1688\":\"I've heard a lot of people say like yeah\",\"1690\":\"this is never happening this is many\",\"1692\":\"years away and that's just not true\",\"1693\":\"there are all kinds of people already\",\"1695\":\"building different components but what\",\"1697\":\"I'm here to do is say look put it all\",\"1699\":\"together so Lang chain provides the last\",\"1703\":\"two cognitive control and task\",\"1705\":\"prosecution\",\"1707\":\"uh Lang chain is fundamentally about\",\"1709\":\"workflows one of the biggest limitations\",\"1711\":\"about Lang chain is that it's linear\",\"1713\":\"it's not cyclical\",\"1715\":\"um that being said it's not that\",\"1716\":\"difficult to couch it in in the middle\",\"1718\":\"of an infinite Loop\",\"1720\":\"um but then you also need to make sure\",\"1722\":\"that you understand these paradigms of\",\"1724\":\"you know pass versus fail and also when\",\"1727\":\"to go up another layer in order to\",\"1729\":\"change directions the ethos project\",\"1731\":\"which was built by teams uh a team that\",\"1736\":\"came together in my gato community\",\"1738\":\"they got I think they got second place\",\"1740\":\"in their hackathon ethos is an example\",\"1743\":\"of that mission first it is the higher\",\"1745\":\"order micro service that that provides\",\"1748\":\"that alignment uh justification and it's\",\"1751\":\"also a microservice so it's modular\",\"1753\":\"some other examples baby AGI and Chaos\",\"1756\":\"GPT were somewhat naive attempts at the\",\"1759\":\"upper layers of of um of the of the\",\"1762\":\"stack they didn't people were trying to\",\"1765\":\"like integrate everything all at once\",\"1766\":\"and didn't really have a clear Mission\",\"1768\":\"and didn't have clear cognitive control\",\"1770\":\"or planning or executive function\",\"1772\":\"anyways all this is available in my\",\"1776\":\"three primary books natural language\",\"1777\":\"cognitive architecture Symphony of\",\"1779\":\"thought and benevolent by Design one\",\"1781\":\"thing to keep in mind like I said is\",\"1782\":\"that this framework is newer\",\"1785\":\"um so it you'll see bits and pieces of\",\"1788\":\"it the progenitor thought in those books\",\"1790\":\"you can also look at this framework that\",\"1792\":\"I just came up with it's under my GitHub\",\"1794\":\"Dave shop benevolent underscore AGI\",\"1797\":\"and uh yeah so there you have it this is\",\"1800\":\"the next generation of software\",\"1803\":\"development so basically whenever\",\"1806\":\"someone comes to me with a pitch\",\"1807\":\"they're like I'm doing a startup unless\",\"1809\":\"they have this level of sophistication\",\"1811\":\"I'm I'm just gonna say like yeah like\",\"1813\":\"you're off to a good start but you need\",\"1816\":\"to be thinking in terms of cognitive\",\"1818\":\"architecture you need to be thinking in\",\"1820\":\"terms of layers of abstraction and\",\"1822\":\"polymorphic applications anything less\",\"1825\":\"than that is just low hanging fruit at\",\"1827\":\"and as we've seen numerous times over\",\"1830\":\"the last six months the very next\",\"1832\":\"iteration of chat GPT or a competitor is\",\"1835\":\"pretty much going to destroy any\",\"1836\":\"business model uh Claude with its 100\",\"1839\":\"000 tokens destroyed a whole bunch of\",\"1841\":\"business models Chad gbt with the\",\"1843\":\"plugins and the code interpreter\",\"1844\":\"destroyed a whole bunch of business\",\"1846\":\"models so unless you're thinking at this\",\"1848\":\"level of sophistication your business\",\"1851\":\"probably won't work and it's not just me\",\"1853\":\"saying it Marissa mayor of um what was\",\"1855\":\"it yahoo she said that generative AI is\",\"1858\":\"going to tear through the tech industry\",\"1859\":\"like a wildfire and that this Wildfire\",\"1862\":\"is going to burn all the brush out and\",\"1864\":\"the brush in this case is startups and\",\"1867\":\"smaller companies\",\"1868\":\"and that's gonna that's gonna be a clean\",\"1870\":\"sweep and we're going to have a lot of\",\"1872\":\"new fresh growth after this that new\",\"1874\":\"fresh growth that she's talking about is\",\"1876\":\"cognitive architecture and polymorphic\",\"1879\":\"applications so thank you for watching\",\"1881\":\"like I said I am available to consult on\",\"1884\":\"any of

                            "According to the video, the focus is not specifically on individual technologies but rather on a new paradigm in software development called polymorphic applications and cognitive architecture. The video emphasizes the importance of understanding and implementing various layers of thinking, planning, and execution to create intelligent and adaptable systems. Here's a breakdown of the key concepts and areas that you might want to explore:\n\n1. **Polymorphic Applications**: Understanding the concept of self-changing applications that can adapt and modify themselves.\n\n2. **Mission-Oriented Programming**: Focusing on clear, measurable, and purposeful missions, including mission-centric design, autonomy, adaptability, and flexibility.\n\n3. **Generative AI and Automation**: Learning about generative AI, which can write code, solve problems, and make decisions. Understanding how it can interact with an organization's tech stack through APIs.\n\n4. **Cognitive Architecture**: Delving into the framework for creating autonomous cognitive entities (ACE), including various layers such as the aspirational layer, global strategy layer, agent model, executive function, cognitive control, and task prosecution.\n\n5. **On-Demand Tools and Tool Factory**: Understanding the ability to synthesize code objects on the fly and the importance of modularity and plug-and-play architecture.\n\n6. **Project Examples**: Exploring projects like Lang chain, Ethos, Baby AGI, and Chaos GPT, which are working on different components of cognitive architecture.\n\n7. **Prompt Engineering**: The video also mentions prompt engineering, which could involve working with large language models and reasoning engines.\n\nWhile the video doesn't specifically name particular programming languages or technologies, the concepts and frameworks discussed would likely require a strong background in software development, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and possibly robotics. Understanding APIs, working with language models, and having the ability to think in terms of layers of abstraction and modular design would be essential skills to develop in line with the video's content."

                            "The rhetorical tactic described here could be categorized as a type of Complex Question Fallacy or Loaded Question. This is a form of question that presupposes something that has not been proven or accepted by all the people involved in the conversation, and it often paints the respondent into a corner.\n\nBy framing the question in a particular way, it assumes certain information that may or may not be true, and it can be used to lead the conversation in a specific direction or to make a particular point. The person asking the question may be trying to imply something without having to directly state and defend it.\n\nThe fallacy can also sometimes be related to Begging the Question, where a conclusion is assumed in the formulation of the question itself, without providing evidence or logical support for that conclusion. In the scenario you described, the individual might be assuming their point is correct without properly arguing for it, instead using the question to imply its truth."

Emphasizing the importance of learning through trial and error, embracing mistakes, and fostering independence is truly valuable, not only in computer science but in all areas of life. Here are some learning targets that align with this philosophy for your middle school computer science class:\n\n### Encouraging a Growth Mindset and Embracing Mistakes\n1. **Understand the Value of Mistakes**: Recognize that mistakes and failures are not dead ends but opportunities for learning and growth.\n2. **Build Resilience**: Develop the ability to persist through challenges and learn from failures.\n3. **Encourage Independent Exploration**: Seek information and solutions independently before asking for help, using resources such as manuals, tutorials, and online searches.\n4. **Reflect and Learn from Errors**: Regularly engage in reflection and discussion about what was learned from mistakes and how those lessons can be applied to future tasks.\n\n### Building Confidence and Independence\n1. **Foster Self-Reliance**: Practice finding and utilizing resources to solve problems independently.\n2. **Encourage Collaboration and Peer Support**: While promoting independence, also create an environment where students feel comfortable seeking help from peers, fostering a collaborative learning community.\n3. **Promote Critical Thinking and Problem-Solving**: Encourage students to analyze problems and apply logical thinking to come up with solutions, rather than looking for quick answers.\n4. **Set Clear Expectations and Provide Support**: Clearly communicate the expectation that students are to work through problems independently but also assure them that support is available if genuinely needed.\n\n### Activities and Assessments\n1. **Project-Based Learning**: Implement projects that require students to apply these skills in context, with minimal direct instruction and plenty of opportunities for trial and error.\n2. **Regular Reflection Activities**: Use journals, class discussions, or other reflection activities to have students articulate what they learned from their mistakes and how they overcame challenges.\n3. **Peer Reviews and Collaboration**: Foster a community of learners by encouraging peer support and collaboration, recognizing that learning from others can be a powerful way to build independence.\n4. **Positive Reinforcement**: Acknowledge and celebrate efforts and growth, not just success, to reinforce the idea that the process of learning is as valuable as the outcome.\n\nThese learning targets can be woven into your existing computer science curriculum, serving as a foundation for how students approach learning new technologies, programming concepts, or any other aspect of the field. By emphasizing these skills from the start, you're setting your students up for lifelong success in computer science and beyond."

Here's a version of the learning targets that might be more relatable for 7th graders:\n\n1. **Learn from Mistakes**: Understand that it's okay to make mistakes when working on the computer. Mistakes help us learn and get better, just like practicing a sport.\n\n2. **Try, Try Again**: If something doesn't work, don't give up! Keep trying different ways to solve the problem, and use books, videos, or friends if you need ideas. It's important to figure things out on your own.\n\n3. **Believe in Yourself**: Know that you can learn anything about computers if you keep trying and use the information around you.

You don't always need a teacher to show you the way.\n\n3. **Believe in Yourself**: Know that you can learn new things on the computer all by yourself. The more you practice and figure things out, the more you'll be able to do.\n\n### For 12th Graders:\n1. **Embrace Failures as Growth Opportunities**: Recognize that mistakes are a natural part of learning. Analyze what went wrong, reflect on it, and use it to enhance your understanding and skills.\n\n2. **Cultivate Independent Problem-Solving**: Focus on developing your ability to tackle challenges on your own. Utilize resources, experiment, and persist in finding solutions without immediate assistance, fostering a sense of autonomy.\n\n3. **Build Confidence in Continuous Self-Learning**: Strengthen your confidence in navigating the ever-changing technological landscape. Emphasize adaptability, resilience, and the use of various resources to learn and evolve independently.\n\nThe wording for the 7th graders is designed to be more approachable and concrete, while the 12th graders' targets are formulated with a more complex understanding of self-directed learning and personal growth."

Here's a version of the learning goals tailored for 6th graders:\n\n### Learning Goals for Computer Science & Technology: (living document)\nEverything you do in here is in service of the following:\n\n**1. Learn from Mistakes and Try Again**: Know that mistakes will happen, and that's okay! When something goes wrong, don't start over; instead, look at it again, watch a video again, or try the task again. Each time, you'll get better because you'll know more.\n\n**2. Figure Things Out on Your Own**: Work on solving problems by yourself. Use tools like books, videos, or the internet, and keep trying even if it doesn't work at first. You'll feel proud when you figure things out without someone showing you.\n\n**3. Believe You Can Keep Learning**: Computers and technology keep changing, and that's exciting! Believe in yourself and know that you can keep learning new things. Use all kinds of tools and resources to help you, and don't be afraid to try something new.\n\nThese reworded learning goals are meant to convey the same essential principles but in language more accessible and engaging for 6th graders. It emphasizes encouragement, curiosity, and the joy of continuous learning."

When it does, look back at what you did, read or watch it again, and try once more. You're not starting from scratch; you're doing it even better because you know more now!\n\n### Version 2:\n**Grow by Making Mistakes**: Mistakes aren't bad; they help you grow! If something goes wrong, take another look, watch again, or do it over. You're not going back to the beginning; you're using what you learned to make it better this time.\n\n### Version 3:\n**Use Mistakes to Improve**: It's okay to make mistakes; that's how you learn! Think about what didn't work, read or watch things again, and give it another try. You're not starting over; you're using new information to make it even better.\n\nThese versions aim to maintain the key message while varying the language to emphasize positivity, growth, and the iterative process of learning."

                            "In the context of RGB stats, which commonly refer to Role-Playing Game (RPG) statistics like Strength, Dexterity, Agility, and Intelligence, the skills you're looking to develop in students could most closely align with the following stats:\n\n1. **Agility**: The ability to quickly and efficiently hop between multiple programs and platforms would closely resemble the \"Agility\" stat in RPGs. Just as high agility allows a character to dodge attacks or perform acrobatic feats, the ability to smoothly transition between different software applications requires a similar level of nimbleness.\n\n2. **Intelligence**: Managing files and making informed decisions while navigating through diverse platforms would also align with the \"Intelligence\" stat. Intelligent characters in RPGs are often skilled in various forms of magic or technology, and the ability to handle multiple programs and file types effectively could be considered a form of \"digital intelligence.\"\n\n3. **Wisdom**: In RPGs, the Wisdom stat often relates to good decision-making and the effective use of resources. Learning when to switch between programs, how to manage files wisely, and when to use specific tools could be likened to having high \"Wisdom.\"\n\n4. **Dexterity**: Some might also argue for a \"Dexterity\" stat, which in RPGs generally affects the character's skill in using tools or performing specific tasks. In the computer realm, being adept at handling various types of software and files could be seen as a form of digital dexterity.\n\nBy relating these skills to RGB stats, you could make the learning experience more engaging for students who are familiar with RPGs, thereby aiding in their understanding of these essential digital skills."

We'll divide the task into different parts and proceed step by step.\n\n### Overview\n1. **Frontend Development**: Designing the student interface for uploading a photo and recording audio, and the teacher interface for reviewing the flash cards.\n2. **Backend Development**: Handling the file uploads and serving the data to the teacher's interface.\n3. **Database**: Storing the student information, including images and audio clips.\n4. **Security Considerations**: Ensuring that the data is handled securely, and only authorized users have access to it.\n\n### Tools and Technologies\n- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React or Vue for a more interactive experience)\n- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, or other frameworks like Django or Flask\n- **Database**: MongoDB, MySQL, or PostgreSQL\n\n### Step-by-Step Implementation\n\n#### Frontend Development (Student Interface)\n1. **Image Upload**:\n   - Create a form with an input field of type \"file\" for selecting an image.\n   - Add validation to ensure that the uploaded file is an image.\n   \n2. **Audio Recording**:\n   - Use the `MediaRecorder` API to record audio in the browser.\n   - Provide a button to start and stop recording.\n   - Convert the audio to a suitable format for uploading (e.g., MP3).\n\n3. **Submission**:\n   - Allow the student to submit the image and audio clip.\n   - Send the files to the server using a POST request.\n\n#### Frontend Development (Teacher Interface)\n1. **Display Flashcards**:\n   - Retrieve the student data from the server.\n   - Display the images as flashcards.\n   - Add a button to play the corresponding audio clip.\n\n2. **Navigation Controls**:\n   - Implement buttons for navigating through the flashcards.\n\n#### Backend Development\n1. **File Upload Endpoint**:\n   - Create an endpoint to handle the file uploads.\n   - Save the images and audio clips to the server or cloud storage (e.g., AWS S3).\n   - Store references to the files in the database.\n\n2. **Retrieval Endpoint**:\n   - Create an endpoint to retrieve the student data for the teacher's interface.\n   - Ensure that only authorized teachers can access this data.\n\n#### Database\n1. **Schema Design**:\n   - Create tables or collections for storing student information, including the paths to the images and audio clips.\n\n#### Security Considerations\n- Implement user authentication to ensure that only authorized students and teachers can access the relevant parts of the application.\n- Use HTTPS to encrypt the data transmitted between the client and server.\n\n### Conclusion\nThis project involves several components, and careful planning will be essential to its success. I can provide more detailed guidance on any of the above steps, including code examples if needed. Just let me know what you'd like to focus on!"

Here are some options you might consider:\n\n1. **Evernote**: This popular note-taking app allows you to record voice memos within notes. You can pause and resume recording as required.\n\n2. **OneNote**: Microsoft's OneNote also offers voice recording features, and you can incorporate these recordings into your notes.\n\n3. **Notability**: If you're using an iOS device, Notability offers seamless integration of voice recordings with your notes.\n\n4. **Google Keep**: This app allows you to make quick voice notes and later transcribe them if needed.\n\nAlways remember to check the latest version of the app to ensure that it has the specific features you require, as features can vary based on the device and operating system you're using."

                            "Creating a precise formula that relates the amount of water, chicken weight, amount of rice, cooking time, and temperature when cooked in the same container is a complex task. It would require considering various factors such as the type of rice, the cut and thickness of the chicken, the cooking method, the specific equipment used, and even the altitude of the location.\n\nHowever, I can provide some general guidelines that you can follow and adjust based on your experience and preferences:\n\n1. **Chicken Weight:** The cooking time for chicken will generally depend on its weight and thickness. A standard boneless chicken breast weighing around 6-8 ounces (170-225 grams) will typically cook in 20-25 minutes at 360\u00b0F (180\u00b0C) in an air fryer.\n\n2. **Rice Amount and Water Ratio:** Brown rice usually requires a 2:1 water-to-rice ratio. So, for every cup of brown rice, you'll need 2 cups of water or broth. The cooking time for brown rice in an air fryer at the same temperature might be around 35-40 minutes.\n\n3. **Temperature:** A common temperature for air frying chicken and cooking brown rice is around 360\u00b0F (180\u00b0C). You may need to adjust this based on your specific air fryer and the desired level of browning for the chicken.\n\n4. **Cooking Time:** You can start by cooking the rice for 15 minutes, then add the chicken and continue cooking for an additional 20-25 minutes. Check for doneness and adjust as needed.\n\n5. **Adjustments:** If you increase the amount of chicken or rice, you may need to adjust the cooking time. More chicken might require additional cooking time, while more rice might require a larger container and possibly a longer cooking time.\n\nHere's a very rough formula that you might use as a starting point, but please note that this is highly generalized and should be adjusted based on your specific situation:\n\n- **Chicken Cooking Time (minutes) = 20 + (Weight of Chicken in ounces - 6) * 2**\n- **Rice Cooking Time (minutes) = 35 + (Amount of Rice in cups - 1) * 5**\n- **Total Water (cups) = Amount of Rice in cups * 2**\n\nAgain, these are very rough guidelines, and I strongly recommend monitoring the cooking process and making adjustments as needed based on your observations and preferences. Experimentation and experience will be your best guides in perfecting this dish."

                            "Cooking time and temperature play crucial roles in determining the final result of a boneless chicken breast. Here's how they can affect the outcome:\n\n### 1. Cooking Time:\n\n- **Too Short:** Undercooking the chicken can leave it raw or underdone in the center, posing a health risk. It will be tough and unappetizing.\n- **Ideal Time:** Cooking the chicken for the right amount of time ensures that it's cooked through but remains juicy and tender. For a standard 6-8 ounce boneless chicken breast, this is typically around 20-25 minutes at 360\u00b0F (180\u00b0C) in an air fryer.\n- **Too Long:** Overcooking the chicken can cause it to become dry, tough, and stringy. The flavors may also become dull.\n\n### 2. Cooking Temperature:\n\n- **Too Low:** Cooking at a low temperature may result in the chicken cooking unevenly. It might become dry before it's fully cooked, or it may take an excessively long time to cook, leading to a loss of flavor and texture.\n- **Ideal Temperature:** An optimal temperature for cooking boneless chicken breast in an air fryer is around 360\u00b0F (180\u00b0C). This allows the chicken to cook through evenly without drying out, retaining its juiciness and flavor.\n- **Too High:** Cooking at a high temperature can cause the outside of the chicken to burn or become overly browned before the inside is fully cooked. This can lead to a tough exterior and a raw or undercooked interior.\n\n### Summary:\n\n- **For Juicy and Tender Chicken:** Cook at a moderate temperature (such as 360\u00b0F or 180\u00b0C) for a sufficient amount of time (around 20-25 minutes for a standard boneless breast). This ensures that the chicken is cooked through but remains moist and flavorful.\n- **For Crispier Exterior:** If you prefer a crispier exterior, you might increase the temperature slightly and reduce the cooking time, but be careful not to overcook the inside.\n- **For Softer Texture:** If you prefer a softer texture, you might reduce the temperature slightly and increase the cooking time, but be mindful of not drying out the chicken.\n\nRemember, these guidelines can vary based on the specific size and thickness of the chicken breast, the type of seasoning or marinade used, and the particular air fryer model. It's always a good idea to use a meat thermometer to check that the chicken has reached an internal temperature of 165\u00b0F (75\u00b0C), indicating that it's fully cooked. Experimentation and observation will help you find the perfect balance for your preferences."

                            "The Ninja Foodi oven is a versatile appliance that offers various cooking functions. For a crispy exterior and juicy, tender interior for your boneless chicken breast, you can utilize the hot air frying function. Here's a step-by-step guide:\n\n### Ingredients:\n- Boneless chicken breasts\n- Olive oil or cooking spray\n- Salt, pepper, garlic powder, paprika, or your preferred seasonings\n- Optional: breadcrumbs for added crispiness\n\n### Instructions:\n\n1. **Preheat the Oven:** Use the hot air frying function and preheat the Ninja Foodi oven to 375\u00b0F (190\u00b0C). The slightly higher temperature will help achieve a crispy exterior.\n\n2. **Prepare the Chicken:** Pat the chicken breasts dry with a paper towel. This helps the seasoning adhere and promotes crispiness.\n\n3. **Season the Chicken:** Lightly coat the chicken breasts with olive oil or cooking spray. Season with salt, pepper, garlic powder, paprika, or other preferred spices. For extra crispiness, you can dredge the chicken in breadcrumbs.\n\n4. **Place in the Oven:** Place the seasoned chicken breasts in the air frying basket or on the air frying tray, ensuring there is space between them for proper air circulation.\n\n5. **Cook the Chicken:** Air fry the chicken breasts for 18-22 minutes, flipping halfway through the cooking time. The exact time may vary depending on the thickness and size of the chicken breasts.\n\n6. **Check for Doneness:** Use a meat thermometer to ensure the chicken has reached an internal temperature of 165\u00b0F (75\u00b0C). The exterior should be golden brown and crispy, while the interior remains juicy and tender.\n\n7. **Rest and Serve:** Allow the chicken to rest for a few minutes before slicing to retain its juices. Serve with your favorite sides and enjoy!\n\n### Tips:\n- Adjust the cooking time and temperature based on the size and thickness of the chicken breasts.\n- Experiment with different seasonings and marinades to suit your taste preferences.\n- If you find the exterior browning too quickly, you can reduce the temperature slightly and extend the cooking time.\n- Always monitor the cooking process, especially if it's your first time using this specific setting, to achieve the desired results.\n\nThe Ninja Foodi oven's hot air frying function should provide the perfect combination of a crispy exterior and juicy interior for your boneless chicken breasts. Enjoy your meal!"

                            "The Ninja Foodi oven is a versatile appliance that offers multiple cooking functions. For a crispy exterior and juicy, tender interior for 282 grams (approximately 10 ounces) of boneless chicken breast, you can use the hot air frying function. Here's a step-by-step guide:\n\n### Ingredients:\n- 282 grams (10 ounces) boneless chicken breast\n- Salt and pepper to taste\n- 1 tablespoon olive oil or cooking spray\n- Optional seasonings (e.g., garlic powder, paprika, herbs)\n\n### Instructions:\n\n1. **Preheat the Oven:** Use the hot air frying function and preheat the Ninja Foodi oven to 375\u00b0F (190\u00b0C). The slightly higher temperature will help achieve a crispy exterior.\n\n2. **Prepare the Chicken:** Pat the chicken breast dry with paper towels to remove excess moisture. This will help the exterior become crispy.\n\n3. **Season the Chicken:** Season the chicken with salt, pepper, and any optional seasonings you like. Drizzle with olive oil or use cooking spray to coat the chicken evenly. The oil will help the exterior crisp up.\n\n4. **Place in the Oven:** Place the chicken breast in the air frying basket or on the air frying tray, ensuring there is space around it for proper air circulation.\n\n5. **Cook the Chicken:** Air fry the chicken for 18-22 minutes. Since the chicken breast is slightly larger (10 ounces), you may need to adjust the cooking time. Start checking for doneness around the 18-minute mark.\n\n6. **Check for Doneness:** Use a meat thermometer to check that the chicken has reached an internal temperature of 165\u00b0F (75\u00b0C). The exterior should be golden brown and crispy, while the interior remains juicy and tender.\n\n7. **Rest and Serve:** Allow the chicken to rest for a few minutes before slicing. This helps retain the juices, keeping the chicken moist.\n\n8. **Adjust as Needed:** Keep in mind that cooking times and temperatures can vary based on the specific size and thickness of the chicken, as well as the particular model of the Ninja Foodi oven. You may need to experiment a bit to find the perfect settings for your preferences.\n\nEnjoy your crispy and juicy boneless chicken breast cooked in the Ninja Foodi oven! Feel free to pair it with your favorite side dishes or sauces."

                            "\"Much Ado About Nothing\" is one of William Shakespeare's most famous comedies, written in the late 16th century. The story is set in Messina and revolves around two pairs of lovers: Benedick and Beatrice, and Claudio and Hero.\n\nAt the heart of the play is the witty and combative relationship between Benedick and Beatrice, who engage in sharp and playful banter, each denying their love for the other. Simultaneously, the young and naive Claudio falls in love with Hero, but is tricked by the play's villain, Don John, into believing that she has been unfaithful. This leads to a public rejection of Hero at the wedding altar. The grief-stricken Hero fakes her death, leading to a series of misunderstandings and contrivances.\n\nEventually, through a series of deceptions and with the help of some clever matchmaking by friends and family, Benedick and Beatrice confess their love for each other. Claudio discovers Hero's innocence and the treachery of Don John, and the play ends with a double wedding, forgiveness, and celebration. The title, \"Much Ado About Nothing,\" refers to the fuss created over false accusations and misunderstandings, a central theme in this delightful and enduring comedy."

                            "The code is intended to calculate the number of days remaining until a person's 50th birthday. However, there is a mistake in the code, and it doesn't actually calculate the 50th birthday but rather the next birthday. Here's a breakdown of what the code does:\n\n1. It imports the `datetime` class from the `datetime` module.\n2. Defines a function `days_until_50th_birthday`, which takes a `birthdate` as an argument.\n3. Inside the function:\n   a. It gets the current date using `datetime.today()`.\n   b. It replaces the year in the `birthdate` with the current year, keeping the month and day the same.\n   c. If the resulting `birthday` is in the past (i.e., before today), it increments the year by 1.\n   d. It calculates the difference in days between the `birthday` and today, and returns that value.\n4. Outside the function, it parses a birthdate string in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD' (you should replace this with an actual date) and calls the function with this birthdate.\n5. It prints the number of days left until the next birthday, not the 50th birthday.\n\nTo calculate the days until the 50th birthday, you would need to adjust the code to take into account the 50th year from the birthdate. You could do this by replacing the year in the `birthday` variable with the birth year plus 50."

                            "Of course! I'd be happy to help you understand computer code. Computer code, also known as programming code or source code, is a set of instructions written in a specific programming language. These instructions tell a computer how to perform a certain task or a series of tasks. Computers can only understand machine language, which consists of binary code (0s and 1s), so programming languages provide a more human-readable way for programmers to communicate with computers.\n\nA typical code consists of statements and expressions that define the logic and behavior of a program. These instructions can include things like defining variables to hold data, performing calculations, making decisions using conditional statements (like if-else), and executing repetitive tasks using loops.\n\nHere's a simple example in Python, a popular programming language, that calculates the sum of numbers from 1 to 10:\n\n```python\nsum = 0\nfor i in range(1, 11):\n    sum += i\n\nprint(\"Sum:\", sum)\n```\n\nIn this code:\n- We initialize a variable called `sum` to store the cumulative total.\n- The `for` loop iterates through numbers 1 to 10.\n- Inside the loop, we add each number to the `sum`.\n- After the loop, we print the final sum.\n\nDifferent programming languages have their own syntax and rules, but the basic concepts of variables, loops, and conditional statements are common across most languages.\n\nIf you have a specific code snippet you'd like me to explain or any questions about programming concepts, feel free to ask!"

When you run this program, it will calculate and print out the number of days remaining until their 50th birthday, taking into account whether the birthday has already occurred this year or not.\n\nRemember to input the correct birthdate in the format mentioned above."
