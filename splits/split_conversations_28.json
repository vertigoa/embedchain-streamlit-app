                            "Once upon a time, in a lush green valley, there was a weathered old barn standing proud and tall. The barn was home to a happy cow named Daisy and her one true companion, an avocado named Alvie. The two were inseparable, sharing adventures and stories together, and creating a bond that transcended their differences.\n\nDaisy was a kind-hearted and wise cow, known throughout the valley for her warmth and patience. Alvie, on the other hand, was a vibrant and spry avocado, always eager to learn new things and explore the world around him. They were an odd pair, but they complemented each other perfectly.\n\nOne sunny morning, Alvie was nestled in the grass beside Daisy, admiring the beauty of the valley. He turned to his bovine friend and said, \"Daisy, what do you say we go on an adventure today? Let's explore beyond the valley and see what we can discover!\"\n\nDaisy chuckled softly, her big brown eyes shining with love for her adventurous friend. \"Why not, Alvie?\" she replied. \"I could use a little excitement in my life.\"\n\nAnd so, the two friends set out on their journey, leaving the comforting shelter of the old barn behind. They traveled across the rolling hills and vast meadows, taking in the breathtaking landscape. Along the way, they encountered fascinating creatures, each with their own unique stories to share.\n\nAs the sun began to set, Daisy and Alvie found themselves on the edge of a mysterious forest. The trees towered above them, their branches casting eerie shadows on the ground. Alvie, feeling a sudden surge of courage, proposed to venture into the forest.\n\nDaisy hesitated for a moment, but seeing the excitement in Alvie's eyes, she agreed. They ventured into the dark, dense woods, curious to uncover the secrets hidden within.\n\nDeep within the forest, they stumbled upon a magical grove, where avocados grew in abundance on an ancient tree. The tree was unlike any they had ever seen before, its trunk twisted and knotted, with shimmering leaves that seemed to dance in the dappled sunlight.\n\nAlvie stared in awe at the sight before him. \"Daisy,\" he whispered, \"this is incredible! I've never seen so many avocados in one place.\"\n\nDaisy smiled gently, nuzzling her friend with affection. \"This must be a special place, Alvie. Perhaps it's a sign that we are meant to be together, despite our differences.\"\n\nAs they stood there, bathed in the golden light of the setting sun, a feeling of peace and belonging washed over them. They knew that no matter where their adventures took them, they would always have each other.\n\nAnd so, Daisy and Alvie returned to their beloved barn, their hearts full of gratitude for the journey they had shared. They knew that the bond they shared was unique and precious, and that their friendship would last a lifetime.\n\nFrom that day on, the barn became a place of refuge and love, where a cow and an avocado lived happily ever after, teaching all who passed by that sometimes the most unexpected friendships are the most magical of all."

                            "Baking cauliflower is a delicious and healthy way to enjoy this versatile vegetable. Here's a simple recipe for baking cauliflower:\n\nIngredients:\n- 1 head of cauliflower\n- 2-3 tablespoons olive oil\n- Salt\n- Pepper\n- Optional: garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, or any other desired spices\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Preheat your oven to 425\u00b0F (220\u00b0C).\n2. Rinse the cauliflower head under cold water and pat it dry.\n3. Remove the leaves and trim the stem. Cut the cauliflower into small florets.\n4. Place the cauliflower florets in a large mixing bowl.\n5. Drizzle olive oil over the florets, and season with salt, pepper, and any other desired spices. Toss the florets to coat them evenly with oil and seasonings.\n6. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat.\n7. Spread the cauliflower florets out in a single layer on the lined baking sheet, ensuring that they are not overcrowded.\n8. Bake the cauliflower in the preheated oven for 20-25 minutes, or until the florets are golden brown and tender when pierced with a fork. For even cooking, you can flip the florets halfway through the baking time.\n9. Remove the baking sheet from the oven and let the cauliflower cool for a few minutes before serving.\n\nFeel free to get creative with additional seasoning options like grated Parmesan cheese, lemon juice, or fresh herbs. Enjoy your baked cauliflower as a side dish, in salads, or as part of a main dish!"

                            "This is my course I guide: D205 DATA ACQUISITION\nWelcome, Study Plan, Frequently Asked Questions,\nand Course Pacing Guide\nlast update: 11 March 2023 \nHOW TO START and WORK THROUGH IN THE COURSE\nYour D205 instructor team has put together the following guide full of resources and course tips \nto help you get the most out of this course and to help you pass the course in the most efficient \nmanner.\nWelcome to D205 Data Acquisition\nThis course teaches relational database concepts and techniques. There will be a task to acquire \ndata from a PostgreSQL database along with a importing dataset into the PostgreSQL database.\nYou will use at least one table from the current PostgreSQL database along with the imported \ndataset to answer a SQL \u201cresearch\u201d question. Please note the SQL question you are answering\nshould be a SQL question that will be answered by retrieving or selecting data from the database \n(NOT a research question where analysis or interpretation is needed). Please keep the SQL \nquestion simple.\nD205 is the first course in the MSDA program that requires a performance Assessment (PA)\nwhich is a project-based deliverable of a word docx and a csv or excel file. You will work on a\nPA task and follow the Requirements and the Rubric (the set of evaluation criterion used by the \nanonymous evaluator to evaluate your submitted PA files). The remainder of the MSDA \nprogram courses all require a PA.\nD205 STUDY PLAN OUTLINE\nThis study plan outline is a result ofstudent feedback on what has helped your fellow Night \nOwls be successful. \nAs you work your way through the Data Camp D205 Course Materials, make sure to read the PA\nRequirements and Rubric after each section/module or two of the Data Camp Course Materials.\nD205 RECOMMENDED STUDY PLAN\nThe study plan below has helped many students succeed in this course. You can create your \nown custom D205 pacing guide by modifying the items below to fit your individual needs.\nBecome familiar with the course material and performance assessment.\na. Start with the videos \u201cTop D205 Performance Assessment Tips\u201d, located in the \nAnnouncements section on the right side of the Course page. The short videos cover all the \ncourse and PA tips. Make sure to click \u2018View All\u2019 to see the links to the videos. Learn how your \nPA will be evaluated by an anonymous evaluator using a rubric, how to format and write your \nPA Word docx and Excel xlsx to make your PA easy to evaluate and increase your pass rate, how \nto navigate the course materials and the Requirements of the PA, how to find and use the Labs \non Demand (LOD) for the technical part of the PA, how to write SQL and use pgAdmin4, the \nprimary tool for SQL, and an expanded list of Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ). Additional\nmaterials are found by clicking on Course Tips and Announcements sections located to \nthe right of the Go To Course Materials. Remember to click View All.\nb. The course materials are located behind the \u201cGo To Course Materials\u201d button on the \ncourse page. The Data Camp D205 course will help you learn SQL, relational databases,\nand data modeling.\nc. The Labs on Demand (LOD) is the WGU-provided virtualserver where the lab\nshould be completed. The link to the LOD is located at the bottom of the Task page\nor click here. \nUse pgAdmin4 to access the databases in D205\na. pgAdmin4 is the primary tool you will use to complete the technical portion of the PA. See the \nAnnouncements and Course Tips for files to help you learn how to use the tool.\nb. You will select one of the two Add-On csv data files in the Lab File folder, located via a shortcut \nfolder on the desktop of the LOD. One of the two add-on csv files should be imported into a new \ntable you will create to hold the csv file. \nc. The SQL question you wrote will be answered by joining the newly created table with the \nimported data with, at a minimum of one, existing table. \nStudy SQL\nData Camp has an extensive custom track for D205. It covers six courses (Five courses are shown\ninitially. Please make sure to click on \u201cSee all content\u201d, located under the fifth course, to see the sixth \ncourse.\nWebinars\nAttend Live or Watch our Webinar recordings by Dr. William Sewell on SQL Sundays and Dr. David\nGagner on Tuesdays. Be on the lookout for an email with the details and connection information.\nSee the Announcements for webinar recording and power point links\nSelect one of the available databases: Churn or Medical_data in Postgres.\nThe databases can be found in LOD Virtual Desktop in the Postgres PgAdmin4.\n1. Select one of the two available data sets already in PostgreSQL: Churn or medical_data.\n2. Create a new table to hold one of the two csv files located in the Lab Files folder and that folder has a \nshortcut on the LOD desktop. Import the one csv file you chose.\n3. Data Camp will teach you about table joins (the statement to combine data from two or more tables). \nJoin at least one table from either the churn or medical_data data sets and join the table with the\nnewly created table that holds the imported csv file from the Lab Files folder. Display at least one \ncolumn from the churn or medical_data data sets with at least one column form the newly created \ntable. There is no requirement to have more than two tables for the select-join statement.\n4. Follow the Requirements to create your PA and pre-/self-evaluate your PA using the Rubric.\na. The PA requires for you to submit a docx and a csv or xlsx file as described in the\nRequirements and make sure meet the Rubric.\nb. It is required to make a video on the Panopto.com website following the two requirements \nfor the video section \u2013 show your code, the running the code, and showing the results of the \nexecuted on the screen and you verbally describing the programs you used to complete the \nPA. Paste the Panopto.com link in the docx in Section F. Do NOT submit a link separately.\nTop Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)\nWhere are the task instructions to complete the Performance Assessment (PA)? On the course \npage is a link task which leads to the task page. The task page includes the Requirements, Rubric, \nand the LOD section as well as many other useful sections and items.\nWhere are the course materials? From the course page, click on Go To Course Materials to go to \nthe D205 Data Camp course. \nWhere is the Labs On Demand (LOD)? At the bottom of the task page is a link to the LOD.\nWhere is the Add-On CSV file that need to be imported into the database? On the LOD desktop, \nthere is a shortcut to the Lab Files folder. A table will need to be created to hold the import of \nyour choice of one of the two CSV files. \nWhere to find additional files to help with the PA and learning SQL? On the right side of the \ncourse page, there is a Course Tips section and an Announcements section. The platinum tips \nvideos from the live webinars on how to prepare a WGU PA, work on the LOD, how to use \npgAdmin4, importing data, SQL, and much more.\nD205 COURSE PACING GUIDE\nThe amount of time any course will take you to complete depends on many factors, including \nyour background, previous experience with the course material, and the amount of time you \ncan devote to studying.

                            "In SQL, aggregate functions cannot be used in WHERE clauses because the WHERE clause filters rows before they are grouped and aggregated. In other words, the WHERE clause operates on individual rows, not on the grouped data.\n\nThe HAVING clause, on the other hand, is used to filter the results of aggregated data based on a specified condition. HAVING works with GROUP BY and aggregate functions to filter groups of rows that don't meet the specified condition. In essence, the HAVING clause operates on the grouped data after the aggregation has been performed.\n\nIn the example provided, the query using the HAVING clause:\n\n```sql\nSELECT release_year\nFROM films\nGROUP BY release_year\nHAVING COUNT(title) > 10;\n```\n\nThis query groups the films by their release year and then filters the groups to show only those years where more than 10 films were released. The HAVING clause is applied after the GROUP BY clause has created the groups, allowing it to work with aggregated data (in this case, the count of titles per release year)."

                            "GitHub is a web-based platform that helps people collaborate on software projects. It allows users to work together on code, track changes, and manage different versions of a project. In simple terms, it's like a social media platform for developers, where they can share and improve their code together.\n\nHere are the main functionalities of GitHub, explained in everyday language:\n\n1. Repositories: A repository (or \"repo\") is like a project folder where all the files related to a specific software project are stored. You can create your own repositories or contribute to others' repositories.\n\n2. Version Control: GitHub uses a system called Git to track changes made to files in a repository. This allows multiple people to work on a project without interfering with each other's work, as well as keeping a record of who made which changes and when.\n\n3. Branches: A branch is a separate line of development within a project. You can think of it as a parallel universe where you can make changes and experiment without affecting the main version of the project (called the \"main\" or \"master\" branch). Once you're happy with your changes, you can merge them back into the main branch.\n\n4. Pull Requests: A pull request (or \"PR\") is a way to propose changes to a project. It's like saying, \"Hey, I've made some improvements to the code, please take a look and consider including them in the main project.\" The project owner or other collaborators can then review your changes, suggest modifications, or accept them.\n\n5. Issues: Issues are a way to report bugs, suggest improvements, or ask questions about a project. They're like a to-do list or a discussion forum for the project.\n\n6. Forks: Forking is when you make a copy of someone else's repository to your own GitHub account. This allows you to make changes to the project without affecting the original repository. If you think your changes are beneficial, you can then submit a pull request to the original project.\n\n7. Collaboration: GitHub makes it easy for developers to collaborate on projects. You can invite others to contribute to your repositories, or you can contribute to others' projects by submitting pull requests and opening issues.\n\nIn summary, GitHub is a platform that helps developers work together on software projects by providing tools for version control, collaboration, and project management."

                            "Forking and branching serve different purposes in a project's development process. Here's a comparison to help you understand when one might choose to fork a repository instead of creating a branch:\n\n1. Ownership and Permissions: Forking creates a separate copy of the entire repository under your GitHub account, while branching creates a new line of development within the same repository. Forking is useful when you don't have write access to the original repository, or when you want to experiment with the code without affecting the original project. Branching is more suitable when you have write access to the repository and want to work on new features or bug fixes within the context of the existing project.\n\n2. Project Independence: Forking creates an independent version of the project, which you can maintain and develop separately from the original. This is useful if you want to create a new project based on the original code, but with a different development direction or purpose. Branching, on the other hand, is ideal when you intend to contribute your changes back to the original project, as it keeps the development tied to the original repository.\n\n3. Collaboration and Contributions: When you fork a repository, your contributions are not automatically shared with the original project. To contribute your changes, you'll need to create a pull request from your fork to the original repository. In contrast, when working with branches, you can directly create a pull request within the same repository, making the process of contributing changes more straightforward.\n\nIn summary, you might choose to fork a repository instead of creating a branch when you don't have write access to the original repository, want to develop an independent project based on the original code, or prefer to keep your contributions separate until they are ready to be shared with the original project."

                            "If you want to continue conversations with ChatGPT and have a more interactive experience, you can create a web application that integrates with the OpenAI API. This will allow you to have a more dynamic and interactive platform for your conversations.\n\nHere's a high-level outline of the steps you'll need to follow:\n\n1. Choose a web development framework: You'll need to choose a suitable web development framework for creating your web application. Some popular choices include Django (Python), Ruby on Rails (Ruby), Express (Node.js), and Laravel (PHP).\n\n2. Set up user authentication: To store each user's unique conversations and allow them to continue where they left off, you'll need to implement user authentication (e.g., using Google OAuth, Facebook Login, or custom email/password login).\n\n3. Create a database: Set up a database to store the conversation logs and user data. You can use any database system you're comfortable with, such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, or MongoDB.\n\n4. Integrate with OpenAI API: Follow the OpenAI API documentation to integrate ChatGPT into your web application. You'll need to sign up for an API key, configure the API client, and create endpoints for sending and receiving messages.\n\n5. Implement conversation storage and retrieval: Design your database schema to store conversation logs, timestamps, and associated user IDs. Create a function to retrieve the conversation history for each user, allowing them to continue where they left off.\n\n6. Build the user interface: Design the frontend of your web application, including an interactive chat interface for users to communicate with ChatGPT. You can use frontend frameworks like React, Angular, or Vue.js to build a responsive and dynamic user interface.\n\n7. Deploy your application: Host your web application on a server or a cloud platform like AWS, Google Cloud, or Heroku. Make sure to configure the domain name, SSL certificates, and other necessary settings.\n\nBy creating a web application, you can have a more interactive and seamless experience for continuing conversations with ChatGPT. Users can log in, see their conversation history, and pick up where they left off. You can also add additional features like search, conversation organization, and collaboration, as needed."

                            "Sure! We can start by building a simple Python web application using the Flask framework and deploy it on Azure. Flask is lightweight and easy to learn, which makes it a great choice for a simple web application.\n\nHere's an outline of the steps you'll need to follow:\n\n1. Install Python and Flask:\n   a. Download and install the latest version of Python (https://www.python.org/downloads/).\n   b. Open a terminal or command prompt and install Flask using pip: `pip install Flask`\n\n2. Create a basic Flask application:\n   a. Create a new folder for your project and navigate to it in the terminal or command prompt.\n   b. Create a new file named `app.py` in the folder and add the following code:\n\n```python\nfrom flask import Flask\n\napp = Flask(__name__)\n\n@app.route('/')\ndef index():\n    return 'Hello, Azure!'\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    app.run()\n```\n\n3. Test your application locally:\n   a. In the terminal, navigate to the project folder and run: `python app.py`\n   b. Open a web browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000` to see your web application running.\n\n4. Prepare your application for Azure deployment:\n   a. Create a `requirements.txt` file in your project folder with the following content:\n\n```\nFlask==<version>\n```\n\nReplace `<version>` with the Flask version you installed (you can check it using `pip freeze`).\n\n   b. Create a `web.config` file in your project folder with the following content:\n\n```xml\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?>\n<configuration>\n  <appSettings>\n    <add key=\"PYTHONPATH\" value=\"D:\\home\\site\\wwwroot\" />\n    <add key=\"WSGI_HANDLER\" value=\"app.app\" />\n  </appSettings>\n  <system.webServer>\n    <handlers>\n      <add name=\"PythonHandler\" path=\"*\" verb=\"*\" modules=\"httpPlatformHandler\" resourceType=\"Unspecified\" />\n    </handlers>\n    <httpPlatform processPath=\"%PYTHON%\\python.exe\" arguments=\"-m flask run --host=0.0.0.0 --port=%HTTP_PLATFORM_PORT%\" startupTimeLimit=\"60\" />\n  </system.webServer>\n</configuration>\n```\n\n5. Deploy your application to Azure:\n   a. Create an Azure account if you don't have one (https://portal.azure.com/).\n   b. Go to the Azure portal and create a new \"Web App\" resource.\n   c. Choose the operating system as \"Windows\" and the runtime stack as \"Python\".\n   d. In the \"Deployment Center,\" choose a deployment method, such as \"Local Git\" or \"GitHub,\" and follow the instructions to deploy your code.\n   e. After deployment, your web application should be running on Azure. You can access it via the provided URL (e.g., https://yourappname.azurewebsites.net).\n\nThis will give you a simple Flask web application running on Azure. To create the ChatGPT integration and a dynamic user interface, you'll need to further develop your application by integrating the OpenAI API, implementing user authentication, setting up a database, and creating frontend templates using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript."

                            "PostgreSQL, often referred to as Postgres, is an open-source, object-relational database management system (ORDBMS) with an emphasis on extensibility and standards compliance. It was first developed in 1986 at the University of California, Berkeley, and has since evolved into a powerful and robust database system used by developers and organizations worldwide.\n\nKey features of PostgreSQL include:\n\n1. ACID compliance: PostgreSQL adheres to the principles of Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability (ACID), ensuring data integrity and consistent transaction processing.\n\n2. Extensibility: PostgreSQL is designed to be easily extensible, allowing developers to define their own data types, operators, functions, and aggregate functions. It also supports procedural languages, such as PL/pgSQL, PL/Tcl, and PL/Perl, for writing server-side functions and triggers.\n\n3. Concurrency control: PostgreSQL uses Multi-Version Concurrency Control (MVCC) to provide concurrent access to the database, enabling high performance and isolation among transactions without the need for read or write locks.\n\n4. Data types: PostgreSQL offers a wide variety of built-in data types, including but not limited to numeric, character, binary, date and time, Boolean, geometric, and network address types. It also supports custom data types, arrays, and hstore (a key-value store).\n\n5. Full-text search: PostgreSQL has built-in support for full-text search, allowing users to perform complex text queries without requiring an external search engine.\n\n6. Indexing: PostgreSQL supports various types of indexes, such as B-tree, Hash, GiST (Generalized Search Tree), SP-GiST (Space-Partitioned Generalized Search Tree), and GIN (Generalized Inverted Index), which cater to different query patterns and data types.\n\n7. Partitioning: PostgreSQL supports table partitioning, allowing large tables to be split into smaller, more manageable pieces, which can improve query performance and ease maintenance tasks.\n\n8. Replication and high availability: PostgreSQL offers various replication and high availability options, such as streaming replication, logical replication, and third-party solutions like Patroni, to ensure data durability and minimize downtime.\n\n9. Security: PostgreSQL provides several security features, including strong authentication mechanisms, native SSL support for encrypted connections, and row-level security for fine-grained access control.\n\n10. SQL compliance: PostgreSQL supports a wide subset of the SQL standard and provides various additional features, such as window functions, common table expressions (CTEs), and lateral subqueries.\n\nPostgreSQL is known for its performance, reliability, and flexibility, making it an attractive choice for a wide range of applications, from small-scale projects to enterprise-level systems."

                            "Sure, let's break down the concept of ACID compliance in simpler terms.\n\nACID stands for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability. These are four important properties that a reliable database management system, like PostgreSQL, must ensure when handling transactions. Transactions are a sequence of one or more operations (like inserting, updating, or deleting data) that need to be executed together to maintain the integrity of the data.\n\n1. Atomicity: Atomicity means that a transaction should be all-or-nothing. Imagine you're transferring money between two bank accounts. There are two steps: subtracting the amount from the sender's account and adding it to the receiver's account. Atomicity ensures that either both steps are completed successfully, or neither step is executed at all. This way, you won't have a situation where money disappears from the sender's account without appearing in the receiver's account.\n\n2. Consistency: Consistency ensures that the database starts in a consistent state and remains consistent after every transaction. In other words, it guarantees that the data follows predefined rules and constraints. For example, if a bank account must maintain a minimum balance, consistency ensures that no transaction will leave the account with a balance below the minimum threshold.\n\n3. Isolation: Isolation means that transactions are isolated from one another, so their operations don't interfere with each other. Imagine two people trying to buy the last concert ticket at the same time. Isolation ensures that only one of them can complete the purchase, while the other will be notified that the ticket is no longer available. This prevents undesirable situations, such as both people thinking they've successfully bought the ticket.\n\n4. Durability: Durability guarantees that once a transaction is completed, its changes to the data are permanent, even in the case of system failures or crashes. For instance, if a power outage occurs after a bank transfer, durability ensures that the transfer is not lost and the correct account balances are maintained when the system comes back online.\n\nIn summary, ACID compliance in PostgreSQL means that the database ensures all transactions are executed in a reliable and orderly manner, maintaining data integrity and preventing issues like lost updates, data corruption, or other inconsistencies that could occur without these safeguards in place."

                            "Certainly! Let's simplify the concept of extensibility in the context of PostgreSQL.\n\nExtensibility refers to the ability of a system to easily adapt or expand its functionality to accommodate new requirements or changes. In the case of PostgreSQL, this means that it is designed to be flexible, allowing developers to customize and enhance its capabilities according to their specific needs.\n\nHere are some examples of PostgreSQL's extensibility features explained in simpler terms:\n\n1. Custom data types: PostgreSQL allows you to create your own data types beyond the built-in ones. For instance, if you are developing a weather application, you might want to create a custom data type to store temperature values in Celsius and Fahrenheit, along with automatic conversion between them. This makes it easier to work with your specific data and ensures consistency across your application.\n\n2. Custom functions and operators: PostgreSQL enables you to define your own functions and operators, which can be used in queries just like built-in functions. Suppose you're building an e-commerce website and need a special function to calculate discounts based on specific rules. With PostgreSQL, you can create this function and use it directly in your SQL queries, making your code more readable and maintainable.\n\n3. Procedural languages: PostgreSQL supports various procedural languages, such as PL/pgSQL, PL/Tcl, and PL/Perl. These languages allow developers to write server-side functions and triggers, which are pieces of code that automatically execute in response to specific events, like inserting, updating, or deleting data. This enables you to add custom logic to your database, ensuring that specific rules or constraints are enforced consistently.\n\n4. Extensions: PostgreSQL supports adding extensions, which are pre-built modules that can be easily installed to provide additional features or functionality. For example, you might use the PostGIS extension to add support for geographic objects and spatial queries, which can be helpful when building a location-based application.\n\nIn summary, extensibility in PostgreSQL means that the database system is designed to be adaptable and customizable, making it easy for developers to tailor its features and functionality to suit their specific application requirements. This flexibility is one of the reasons why PostgreSQL is a popular choice for a wide range of projects."

                            "Sure! Let's first explain concurrency and then discuss how PostgreSQL handles it using Multi-Version Concurrency Control (MVCC).\n\nConcurrency refers to the ability of a database system to handle multiple users or tasks accessing and modifying the data simultaneously. In a busy database system, many users might be reading and updating the same data at the same time, and managing this access is crucial to ensure data consistency and prevent conflicts or errors.\n\nNow let's discuss MVCC, which is the technique PostgreSQL uses to manage concurrency:\n\nMulti-Version Concurrency Control (MVCC) is a method that allows multiple users to access and modify the database concurrently without causing conflicts or affecting each other's work. Instead of locking the data being accessed, which can slow down the system and create bottlenecks, MVCC creates separate \"snapshots\" of the data for each transaction. These snapshots represent the state of the data at the start of the transaction and are used to isolate the changes made by different users.\n\nTo explain MVCC in simpler terms, imagine a library where multiple people are reading and taking notes from the same book. Instead of waiting for one person to finish using the book, MVCC creates a photocopy of the book for each person, allowing them to read and take notes at the same time without affecting each other. When someone wants to update the book (e.g., correct a typo), they make the change on their photocopy. Once they're done, MVCC checks if anyone else has made changes to the same page since the photocopy was created. If not, the change is accepted, and the original book is updated.\n\nMVCC in PostgreSQL has several benefits:\n\n1. High performance: By avoiding locking data, MVCC allows multiple users to access the database concurrently without causing delays or performance issues.\n\n2. Consistency: MVCC ensures that each user sees a consistent view of the data, even when other users are making changes simultaneously.\n\n3. Isolation: MVCC provides isolation between transactions, meaning that the changes made by one user are not visible to others until the transaction is completed. This prevents conflicts and ensures that each user's work remains independent.\n\nIn summary, concurrency is the ability of a database system to manage simultaneous access and modification of data by multiple users. PostgreSQL uses Multi-Version Concurrency Control (MVCC) to handle concurrency efficiently, providing high performance, consistency, and isolation between transactions, ensuring a smooth user experience and maintaining data integrity."

                            "Of course! Let's simplify the concept of data types in PostgreSQL and provide some examples to make it easier to understand.\n\nData types are essentially categories that define the kind of data a database can store and how it should be treated. Think of them as containers with labels that help the database understand what kind of information is being stored and how to work with it. PostgreSQL offers a wide variety of built-in data types to accommodate different kinds of data.\n\nHere are some examples of data types in PostgreSQL, explained in simpler terms:\n\n1. Numeric: Numeric data types are used to store numbers. PostgreSQL provides several numeric data types, such as integers (whole numbers like 5, -3, or 42) and floating-point numbers (decimal numbers like 3.14 or -12.5). This allows you to store and perform calculations on various types of numerical data.\n\n2. Character: Character data types are used to store text, like names, addresses, or descriptions. PostgreSQL has different character data types, such as \"varchar\" (variable-length character strings) and \"text\" (longer text). These data types let you store and search through text information efficiently.\n\n3. Binary: Binary data types are used for storing data in binary format, such as images, audio files, or serialized objects. In PostgreSQL, the \"bytea\" data type is used for this purpose. This allows you to store and retrieve files or other binary data directly in the database.\n\n4. Date and time: Date and time data types help you store and manage information related to dates, times, or both, such as birthdays, appointments, or historical events. PostgreSQL provides various date and time data types, like \"date\" (for storing dates), \"time\" (for storing times), and \"timestamp\" (for storing both date and time).\n\n5. Boolean: Boolean data types are used to store true or false values, such as whether a user is active or if an item is available for purchase. In PostgreSQL, the \"boolean\" data type is used to store and work with this kind of information.\n\n6. Geometric and network address types: PostgreSQL also offers data types for storing geometric shapes (like points, lines, or polygons) and network addresses (like IP addresses). These specialized data types allow you to perform advanced queries and operations related to spatial or networking data.\n\nIn addition to these built-in data types, PostgreSQL also supports custom data types, which allow you to define your own categories for storing data that may not fit well into the predefined types.\n\nIn summary, data types in PostgreSQL are categories that help the database understand and manage different kinds of information. By offering a wide variety of built-in data types and supporting custom ones, PostgreSQL ensures that you can store and work with a diverse range of data in an efficient and organized manner."

                            "Learning data analytics can indeed be helpful for understanding or working with large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 in several ways:\n\n1. Data preprocessing and analysis: LLMs are trained on vast amounts of text data, which often require preprocessing and analysis to ensure quality and relevance. Data analytics skills can help you better understand how to clean, preprocess, and analyze text data to prepare it for training or fine-tuning language models.\n\n2. Model evaluation and interpretation: Data analytics techniques can be applied to evaluate the performance of LLMs by analyzing various metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, or F1 score. These skills can help you interpret the results, compare different models, and understand the strengths and weaknesses of the models you're working with.\n\n3. Feature engineering: Although LLMs like GPT-4 are designed to automatically learn complex features from the input data, some tasks may still benefit from feature engineering, especially when dealing with domain-specific data. Data analytics skills can help you identify and create meaningful features that can improve the performance of the LLM in specific applications.\n\n4. Visualization and communication: Data analytics often involves creating visualizations and presenting results in a clear and concise manner. These skills can be valuable when working with LLMs, as they can help you effectively communicate the performance, limitations, and potential improvements of the model to stakeholders or team members.\n\n5. General understanding of data-driven approaches: LLMs are a part of the broader field of data-driven artificial intelligence and machine learning. Familiarity with data analytics concepts, techniques, and tools can provide you with a better understanding of the underlying principles and challenges involved in working with LLMs and other data-driven models.\n\nWhile learning data analytics can be beneficial for working with LLMs, it is also essential to have a solid understanding of natural language processing (NLP) techniques, algorithms, and tools specific to LLMs. Combining data analytics skills with expertise in NLP can make you more effective in working with, optimizing, and applying large language models in various applications."

Let's simplify the concept of ACID properties in the context of SQL and PostgreSQL, making it easy to understand for the average person.\n\nACID stands for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability. These are four key properties that ensure reliable and consistent database transactions. Transactions are a series of operations, such as reading from or writing to a database, that need to be executed together to maintain data integrity.\n\nLet's break down each ACID property and provide a simple explanation:\n\n1. Atomicity: Atomicity means that a transaction should be treated as a single unit of work, either completed fully or not executed at all. If any part of the transaction fails, the whole transaction is rolled back, and the database remains unchanged. Imagine you're transferring money between two bank accounts. The transaction involves withdrawing money from one account and depositing it into another. With atomicity, both actions must succeed; otherwise, neither will occur, ensuring that no"

                            "Certainly! Let's simplify the concept of full-text search in the context of PostgreSQL and make it easy to understand for the average person.\n\nFull-text search is a feature that allows you to search for specific words or phrases within large amounts of text data, such as articles, emails, or product descriptions. PostgreSQL provides built-in support for full-text search, making it easier and more efficient to find relevant information in the database.\n\nTo understand full-text search better, let's use a real-world example. Imagine you have a digital library containing thousands of books. You want to find all the books that mention a particular topic, like \"ancient Rome.\" Without full-text search, you would have to go through each book page by page, looking for the relevant words, which could be very time-consuming.\n\nPostgreSQL's full-text search simplifies this process by creating an index of all the words in the text data. This index, like the index in the back of a book, helps the database quickly find where each word appears in the text. When you search for a word or phrase, PostgreSQL uses this index to efficiently locate the relevant information without scanning the entire text.\n\nTo perform full-text search in PostgreSQL, the database uses a few key components:\n\n1. Text normalization: This step involves converting the text data into a standardized format, such as changing all words to lowercase, removing punctuation, and reducing words to their basic form (e.g., \"running\" becomes \"run\"). This makes it easier to compare and match search terms.\n\n2. Text representation: PostgreSQL represents the text using a data structure called \"tsvector,\" which stores the normalized words and their positions in the text. This compact representation speeds up the search process.\n\n3. Query representation: When you want to search for a word or phrase, PostgreSQL converts your query into a \"tsquery\" format, which is compatible with the \"tsvector\" representation used for the text data.\n\n4. Search and ranking: PostgreSQL uses the \"tsvector\" and \"tsquery\" representations to efficiently search for the relevant words or phrases in the text data. It can also rank the results based on their relevance to the search query, making it easier to find the most important information.\n\nIn summary, full-text search in PostgreSQL is a powerful feature that allows you to efficiently search for specific words or phrases within large amounts of text data. By creating an index of the words in the text and using efficient search algorithms, PostgreSQL makes it easy and fast to find the relevant information, saving you time and effort."

                            "Yes, the concept behind PostgreSQL's full-text search and Windows' file search index is similar. Both systems aim to speed up searching by creating an index that allows for faster lookup and retrieval of relevant information.\n\nIn the case of Windows' file search, the operating system creates an index of the files and their content on your computer. This index contains metadata about the files, such as file names, file types, and the contents of text-based files. When you search for a file or a phrase within a file, Windows uses this index to quickly locate the relevant files without scanning through all the files on your computer. This significantly improves the speed and efficiency of the search process.\n\nSimilarly, PostgreSQL's full-text search creates an index of the words in the text data, making it easier and faster to search for specific words or phrases within large amounts of text. By using an index and efficient search algorithms, PostgreSQL can quickly find the relevant information without having to scan through the entire text.\n\nWhile the underlying techniques and data structures may differ, both PostgreSQL's full-text search and Windows' file search index share the common goal of improving search efficiency by creating an index to speed up the lookup and retrieval of relevant information."

This is where \"tsvector\" and \"tsquery\" come into play.\n\n1. Tsvector: A \"tsvector\" is a compact representation of the text data that PostgreSQL uses for full-text search. It stores the normalized words (words in their basic form, without punctuation, and case differences) and their positions within the text. By using this compact representation, PostgreSQL can search the text data more efficiently.\n\nThink of \"tsvector\" as a list of keywords extracted from the text data, which makes it easier for PostgreSQL to find relevant information when you perform a search.\n\n2. Tsquery: When you want to search for a word or phrase in the text data, you need to represent your search query in a format that is compatible with the \"tsvector\" representation. This is where \"tsquery\" comes in. A \"tsquery\" is the search query transformed into a format that PostgreSQL can use to efficiently search through the \"tsvector\" representation of the text data.\n\nConsider \"tsquery\" as your search keywords, converted into a format that matches the way PostgreSQL represents the text data. This ensures that the database can quickly compare and match your search query with the indexed text data.\n\nIn summary, \"tsvector\" and \"tsquery\" are representations used by PostgreSQL to efficiently search text data in a full-text search. \"Tsvector\" represents the text data, while \"tsquery\" represents your search query. By converting both text data and search query into these compatible formats, PostgreSQL can quickly and efficiently perform the full-text search, saving time and resources."

                            "Sure, let's simplify the concept of indexing in PostgreSQL and make it easy to understand for the average person.\n\nAn index in PostgreSQL is similar to the index in the back of a book. In a book's index, you find keywords with page numbers that help you quickly locate the relevant information within the book. Similarly, in a database, an index helps you find specific records or data without having to scan through the entire dataset.\n\nWhen it comes to PostgreSQL, indexing is a technique used to speed up data retrieval. It creates a data structure that maps the values in a specific column (or columns) to the corresponding rows in the table. By using an index, PostgreSQL can avoid scanning the entire table and directly access the rows with the desired values, making the search process much faster and more efficient.\n\nHere's a simple example to illustrate the concept of indexing:\n\nImagine you have a large phone book containing thousands of names and phone numbers. Without an index, to find a specific person's phone number, you would have to look through every entry one by one, which could be time-consuming. However, if the phone book is sorted alphabetically by last name, it becomes much easier and quicker to find the desired information. In this case, the alphabetical ordering acts as an index, guiding you to the correct section of the phone book without having to check each entry.\n\nIn PostgreSQL, there are several types of indexes to choose from, each optimized for different use cases. Some common index types are:\n\n1. B-tree index: This is the default index type and is suitable for most cases. It can be used with any data type and supports various types of queries, such as equality and range searches.\n\n2. Hash index: This index type is used for equality searches on data types that do not have a natural sort order. It's not as versatile as B-tree indexes but can be faster in specific situations.\n\n3. GiST (Generalized Search Tree) index: This index type is used for complex data types, such as geometric or text data, and supports complex queries and search conditions.\n\n4. SP-GiST (Space-Partitioned Generalized Search Tree) index: This index type is designed for complex data types with non-overlapping, partitioned data.\n\n5. GIN (Generalized Inverted Index) index: This index type is used for complex data types, such as arrays or full-text search data, and is efficient for containment and containment-like queries.\n\nIn summary, indexing in PostgreSQL is a technique used to speed up data retrieval by creating a data structure that maps specific column values to their corresponding rows in the table. By using an index, PostgreSQL can quickly locate the relevant information without scanning the entire dataset, making the search process more efficient and faster."

                            "Sure, let's simplify the concept of extensibility in PostgreSQL and make it easy to understand for the average person.\n\nExtensibility, in the context of PostgreSQL, means that the database system can be easily expanded or customized to meet specific requirements, add new features, or support new data types. This flexibility makes PostgreSQL a powerful and adaptable choice for various applications and use cases.\n\nTo better understand the idea of extensibility, let's use an analogy. Think of PostgreSQL as a set of building blocks or LEGO bricks. You can assemble these blocks in different ways to create various structures, and you can also add more blocks to the set to make even more diverse and complex creations. This flexibility to adapt and extend the system is what makes PostgreSQL extensible.\n\nPostgreSQL's extensibility can be seen in various aspects, including:\n\n1. Custom data types: PostgreSQL allows you to create your own data types that suit your specific needs, enabling you to store and manage data more efficiently and accurately.\n\n2. Custom functions: You can create your own functions in PostgreSQL using different programming languages, such as SQL, Python, or C. This allows you to implement custom logic and processing that is tailored to your application.\n\n3. Custom operators: In addition to the built-in operators (e.g., +, -, *, /), PostgreSQL allows you to create custom operators for your data types, making it easier to work with complex data and perform specific operations.\n\n4. Custom aggregation functions: PostgreSQL enables you to create custom aggregation functions, which can be useful for processing and summarizing large amounts of data in a way that is specific to your requirements.\n\n5. Custom index types: You can create custom index types in PostgreSQL to optimize the performance of specific queries or support complex data types and search conditions.\n\n6. Extensions: PostgreSQL supports a wide range of extensions, which are pre-built modules that can be easily added to the database system to provide additional features or functionality. Some popular extensions include PostGIS (for geographic data), hstore (for key-value storage), and pg_trgm (for text similarity search).\n\nIn summary, extensibility in PostgreSQL refers to the database system's ability to be easily expanded or customized to meet specific needs, support new data types, and add new features. This flexibility makes PostgreSQL a powerful and adaptable choice for a wide variety of applications and use cases."

                            "I understand that the concept of sorting by multiple columns may be confusing at first, so let me explain it in a simpler way.\n\nWhen you use ORDER BY with multiple columns, PostgreSQL sorts the results based on the values in the first column specified. If there are any rows with the same value in that first column, it will then use the values in the second column to sort those rows. This process continues for each subsequent column specified in the ORDER BY clause.\n\nLet's consider an example to help clarify this concept. Imagine we have a table named \"people\" with the following data:\n\n```\nName       | Birthdate\n-----------+----------\nAlice      | 1990-01-01\nBob        | 1990-01-01\nCarol      | 1985-05-20\nDave       | 1985-05-20\nEve        | 2000-03-15\n```\n\nNow, let's use the example query you provided:\n\n```sql\nSELECT birthdate, name\nFROM people\nORDER BY birthdate, name;\n```\n\nIn this case, PostgreSQL first sorts the data by the \"birthdate\" column. The sorted data looks like this:\n\n```\nBirthdate  | Name\n-----------+----------\n1985-05-20 | Carol\n1985-05-20 | Dave\n1990-01-01 | Alice\n1990-01-01 | Bob\n2000-03-15 | Eve\n```\n\nNow, within each group of rows with the same birthdate, PostgreSQL sorts the data by the \"name\" column. In our example, there are two groups with the same birthdate: \"1985-05-20\" (Carol and Dave) and \"1990-01-01\" (Alice and Bob). The names within these groups are already sorted alphabetically, so the final result remains the same:\n\n```\nBirthdate  | Name\n-----------+----------\n1985-05-20 | Carol\n1985-05-20 | Dave\n1990-01-01 | Alice\n1990-01-01 | Bob\n2000-03-15 | Eve\n```\n\nIn summary, when you use ORDER BY with multiple columns, PostgreSQL sorts the results based on the first column specified. If there are rows with the same value in that column, it will use the values in the next specified column to sort those rows. This process continues for each column specified in the ORDER BY clause, ensuring a consistent and well-ordered result set."

In other words, when you're using GROUP BY, all the columns in the SELECT clause must either be a part of the GROUP BY clause or be used within an aggregate function.\n\nHere's an example to help you understand this:\n\nSuppose we have the following \"employees\" table:\n\n```\nid | name  | sex\n---+-------+-----\n1  | Alice | F\n2  | Bob   | M\n3  | Carol | F\n4  | Dave  | M\n```\n\nNow, let's say we want to find the number of employees for each sex. We can use the following query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT sex, COUNT(*)\nFROM employees\nGROUP BY sex;\n```\n\nIn this query, we're using the \"sex\" column in the GROUP BY clause, and we're applying the COUNT(*) aggregate function to count the number of employees for each sex. The result would look like this:\n\n```\nsex | count\n----+-------\nF   | 2\nM   | 2\n```\n\nHowever, if we try to include the \"name\" column in the SELECT clause without using it in an aggregate function or the GROUP BY clause, like this:\n\n```sql\nSELECT name, sex, COUNT(*)\nFROM employees\nGROUP BY sex;\n```\n\nSQL will return an error because \"name\" is not part of the GROUP BY clause, and it's not used within an aggregate function. The reason for this error is that SQL doesn't know how to combine the \"name\" values within each group since they are not being aggregated or grouped.\n\nTo fix this error, you would either need to include the \"name\" column in the GROUP BY clause or use an aggregate function with the \"name\" column.\n\nI hope this clears up the confusion. Let me know if you need further clarification or have any more questions!"

Metadata is data about data \u2013 in this case, information about the structure of your database, such as tables, columns, and their properties.\n\nThe `information_schema` has several tables that you can query using the familiar `SELECT * FROM` syntax, including:\n\n1. `tables`: This table contains information about all the tables in your current database.\n2. `columns`: This table has information about all the columns in all tables within your current database.\n3. And more...\n\nIn the context of this lesson, you'll be focusing on the 'public' schema, which is a specific part of the `information_schema`. The 'public' schema contains information about user-defined tables and databases \u2013 the ones you create and work with directly. There are other schemas that store system information, but for this course, you'll only need to explore user-defined content.\n\nTo access information from the 'public' schema, you can use the `table_schema` column in the `tables` and `columns` tables of the `information_schema`. Here's an example query to get all the user-defined tables in your current database:\n\n```sql\nSELECT *\nFROM information_schema.tables\nWHERE table_schema = 'public';\n```\n\nSimilarly, you can query the `columns` table to get information about all the columns in the user-defined tables of your current database:\n\n```sql\nSELECT *\nFROM information_schema.columns\nWHERE table_schema = 'public';\n```\n\nIn summary, the `information_schema` is a special database that stores metadata about your current database's structure. You can query it to learn more about the tables and columns in your database, focusing on the 'public' schema for user-defined information."

These diagrams are often called Entity-Relationship Diagrams (ERDs) or Database Schema Diagrams. Here are some popular tools and methods:\n\n1. **Manual Drawing**: You can use drawing tools like Microsoft Visio, Lucidchart, or even PowerPoint to manually create diagrams by adding shapes representing tables and lines to show relationships between them. This method can be time-consuming but provides full control over the design and layout.\n\n2. **Database Management Tools**: Many database management tools, such as pgAdmin (for PostgreSQL), MySQL Workbench (for MySQL), or SQL Server Management Studio (for SQL Server), have built-in features to generate ERDs or schema diagrams automatically from an existing database schema. These tools typically allow you to reverse-engineer a schema and display the relationships visually.\n\n3."

To better understand the hierarchy, let's break it down:\n\n1. Database: Your main database, which contains all the tables, including system tables and user-defined tables.\n\n2. Schemas: Within the database, there are different schemas, which are logical containers for organizing database objects like tables and views. The 'public' schema holds user-defined tables, while other schemas hold system information.\n\n3. Tables: Inside the 'public' schema, you have your user-defined tables that store your actual data. Each table has a unique name and a set of columns with defined data types.\n\n4. Columns: The columns within each table represent the fields or attributes of the data stored in the table. They have specific data types such as text, integer, or date.\n\nThe hierarchy looks like this:\n\n- Database\n  - Schemas\n    - 'public' schema (user-defined)\n      - Tables (user-defined)\n        - Columns (attributes of the data)\n\nThe `information_schema` is a separate meta-database that provides metadata about your main database, and it also follows a similar hierarchy. The `information_schema` has tables like `tables` and `columns` that store information about the tables and columns in your main database, respectively.

An entity type is a collection of entities that share the same properties or attributes. In a relational database, these entities are represented as rows within a table, and their attributes are represented as columns.\n\nFor example, if you have an entity type called \"Customer,\" you would create a table named \"Customers\" to store all customer-related data. Each row in the \"Customers\" table would represent an individual customer, and the columns would store the different attributes of each customer, such as name, address, and phone number.\n\nIn summary, entity types in ER modeling correspond to tables in a relational database, with each entity represented as a row and each attribute as a column within the table."

To achieve this, you'll truncate the values in the column before converting the data type to avoid data loss or errors due to values exceeding the new length limit.\n\nHere's a more detailed explanation of the provided SQL syntax:\n\n1. `ALTER TABLE table_name`: This command is used to modify the structure of an existing table, identified by its name `table_name`.\n\n2. `ALTER COLUMN column_name`: This clause specifies the column you want to modify, identified by its name `column_name`.\n\n3. `TYPE varchar(x)`: This part sets the new data type of the column to `varchar` with a maximum length of x characters.\n\n4. `USING SUBSTRING(column_name FROM 1 FOR x)`: The `USING` clause is employed to apply a specific function to the column's values before converting the data type. In this case, the `SUBSTRING` function is used to extract a substring from the column's original values, starting from the first character (position 1) and retaining only the first x characters. By applying the `SUBSTRING` function, the values are truncated to fit the new `varchar(x)` requirement.\n\nHere's a more concrete example:\n\nImagine you have a table called `products` with a column named `description` that has a data type of `varchar(1000)`. You want to change the data type of the `description` column to `varchar(100)` to save storage space. To do this without causing errors due to values being too long for the new data type, you can use the following SQL command:\n\n```sql\nALTER TABLE products\nALTER COLUMN description\nTYPE varchar(100)\nUSING SUBSTRING(description FROM 1 FOR 100);\n```\n\nThis command will update the `description` column data type to `varchar(100)` and truncate its values to the first 100 characters, ensuring that they fit the new length constraint."

I'll use two sample tables `orders` and `customers` for these examples.\n\n1. `orders` table:\n\n| order_id | customer_id | product   | price |\n|----------|-------------|-----------|-------|\n| 1        | 1           | Laptop    | 1000  |\n| 2        | 3           | Mouse     | 50    |\n| 3        | 2           | Headphones| 100   |\n| 4        | 1           | Keyboard  | 80    |\n\n2. `customers` table:\n\n| customer_id | name  |\n|-------------|-------|\n| 1           | Alice |\n| 2           | Bob   |\n| 3           | Carol |\n| 4           | David |\n\n**Inner Join:**\n\nAn inner join returns only rows where there is a match in both tables.\n\n```sql\nSELECT orders.order_id, customers.name, orders.product, orders.price\nFROM orders\nINNER JOIN customers ON orders.customer_id = customers.customer_id;\n```\n\nResult:\n\n| order_id | name  | product   | price |\n|----------|-------|-----------|-------|\n| 1        | Alice | Laptop    | 1000  |\n| 2        | Carol | Mouse     | 50    |\n| 3        | Bob   | Headphones| 100   |\n| 4        | Alice | Keyboard  | 80    |\n\n**Left Join (Left Outer Join):**\n\nA left join returns all rows from the left table and matched rows from the right table. If no match is found, NULL values are returned for the right table's columns.\n\n```sql\nSELECT customers.name, orders.product, orders.price\nFROM customers\nLEFT JOIN orders ON customers.customer_id = orders.customer_id;\n```\n\nResult:\n\n| name  | product   | price |\n|-------|-----------|-------|\n| Alice | Laptop    | 1000  |\n| Alice | Keyboard  | 80    |\n| Bob   | Headphones| 100   |\n| Carol | Mouse     | 50    |\n| David | NULL      | NULL  |\n\n**Right Join (Right Outer Join):**\n\nA right join returns all rows from the right table and matched rows from the left table. If no match is found, NULL values are returned for the left table's columns.\n\n```sql\nSELECT customers.name, orders.product, orders.price\nFROM customers\nRIGHT JOIN orders ON customers.customer_id = orders.customer_id;\n```\n\nResult:\n\n| name  | product   | price |\n|-------|-----------|-------|\n| Alice | Laptop    | 1000  |\n| Carol | Mouse     | 50    |\n| Bob   | Headphones| 100   |\n| Alice | Keyboard  | 80    |\n\n**Full Outer Join:**\n\nA full outer join returns all rows when there is a match in either the left table or the right table. If no match is found, NULL values are returned for the columns of the table where no match is found.\n\n```sql\nSELECT customers.name, orders.product, orders.price\nFROM customers\nFULL OUTER JOIN orders ON customers.customer_id = orders.customer_id;\n```\n\nResult:\n\n| name  | product   | price |\n|-------|-----------|-------|\n| Alice | Laptop    | 1000  |\n| Alice | Keyboard  | 80    |\n| Bob   | Headphones| 100   |\n| Carol | Mouse     | 50    |\n| David | NULL      | NULL  |\n\nPlease note that the FULL OUTER JOIN syntax is not supported in all databases, like MySQL. You can achieve similar results in MySQL using a combination of LEFT JOIN and RIGHT"

                            "In SQL, when using joins like LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, or INNER JOIN, the position of the tables in your query determines which table is considered the left or right table.\n\nHere's the general syntax for joins:\n\n```\nSELECT ... FROM table1 (LEFT|RIGHT|INNER) JOIN table2 ON ...\n```\n\nIn this syntax, `table1` is considered the \"left\" table, and `table2` is considered the \"right\" table. The join operation is performed based on the specified join condition in the ON clause.\n\nLet's look at an example:\n\n```sql\nSELECT customers.name, orders.product, orders.price\nFROM customers\nLEFT JOIN orders ON customers.customer_id = orders.customer_id;\n```\n\nIn this example, the `customers` table is the left table, and the `orders` table is the right table. The LEFT JOIN operation returns all rows from the `customers` table (the left table) and matched rows from the `orders` table (the right table). If there is no match found for a row in the `customers` table, NULL values are returned for the columns of the `orders` table.\n\nThe same applies to RIGHT JOIN or INNER JOIN operations. The position of the tables in the query determines which one is considered the left or right table."

                            "In SQL, `ON` is a keyword used in JOIN operations to specify the condition on which the tables should be joined. It is not an abbreviation and does not stand for anything. The `ON` keyword is used to indicate how the rows from the two tables being joined should be matched based on a certain criteria, usually by comparing the values of specific columns in each table.\n\nHere's an example of the `ON` keyword used in a JOIN operation:\n\n```sql\nSELECT customers.name, orders.product, orders.price\nFROM customers\nINNER JOIN orders ON customers.customer_id = orders.customer_id;\n```\n\nIn this example, the `ON` keyword is used to specify the join condition: `customers.customer_id = orders.customer_id`. This condition tells the database to match rows from the `customers` table and the `orders` table where the `customer_id` values in both tables are equal.\n\nBy using the `ON` keyword, you can define complex join conditions, involving multiple columns or even functions. It helps to combine the data from different tables based on specific relationships between them."

                            "The purpose of using joins in SQL is to combine data from two or more tables in a relational database based on a related column or condition. Joins enable you to retrieve information from multiple tables in a single query, allowing you to combine and analyze data across tables, providing a more comprehensive view of the data stored in the database.\n\nIn a relational database, data is often distributed across multiple tables to avoid redundancy and to ensure data integrity. This normalization process breaks down the data into smaller, related tables, which makes it necessary to use joins to bring the data back together when querying for information.\n\nHere are some common scenarios where joins are useful:\n\n1. Combining data from related tables: For instance, you have an `orders` table and a `customers` table, with a common column `customer_id`. To get a list of orders along with the customer details, you would use a join to match rows based on the `customer_id` column.\n\n2. Filtering data based on related data: If you need to filter the rows from one table based on data in another table, you can use a join. For example, if you want to list all products sold by a specific vendor, you would join the `products` table with the `vendors` table and filter based on the vendor's name or ID.\n\n3. Aggregating data from multiple tables: Joins can be used to aggregate data from multiple tables to perform calculations or summaries. For example, you could join a `sales` table with an `employees` table to calculate the total sales per employee.\n\nThere are various types of joins in SQL, such as INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN (LEFT OUTER JOIN), RIGHT JOIN (RIGHT OUTER JOIN), and FULL OUTER JOIN, each serving a different purpose and providing different results based on how the tables are combined. Understanding and using joins effectively is a critical skill for working with relational databases."

The join condition is that the `week_id` column in the `runs_fact` table matches the `week_id` column in the `week_dim` table. This join allows us to combine information from both tables based on their common `week_id` values.\n\n5. `WHERE month = 'July' and year = '2019'`: This line filters the results to only include rows where the `month` column has the value 'July' and the `year` column has the value '2019'. This limits the data to the specified time period, July 2019.\n\nSo, in simple terms, this query calculates the total duration of all runs (`SUM(duration_mins)`) in the `runs_fact` table that occurred in July 2019. The INNER JOIN with the `week_dim` table is used to connect the runs' data with the relevant week and filter the results based on the desired month and year."

                            "While it is not mandatory to name constraints in SQL, it is considered a good practice to do so. Naming your constraints provides several benefits, such as:\n\n1. Readability: By giving meaningful names to your constraints, you make your SQL code easier to read and understand, both for yourself and for others who may work with it.\n\n2. Maintenance: When constraints have names, it is easier to modify or delete them later. If you don't provide a name for a constraint, the database management system (DBMS) will automatically assign a system-generated name, which may not be easily recognizable or descriptive.\n\n3. Consistency: Naming your constraints allows you to follow a consistent naming convention throughout your database schema. This helps to maintain a clean and organized schema, making it easier to understand the relationships and dependencies between tables.\n\nTo name a constraint, you can use the following syntax when creating a table or altering an existing one:\n\n```sql\nCREATE TABLE table_name (\n    column_name data_type,\n    CONSTRAINT constraint_name constraint_type (column_name)\n);\n```\n\nFor example, if you want to create a table named `orders` with a primary key constraint on the `order_id` column, you could name the constraint as follows:\n\n```sql\nCREATE TABLE orders (\n    order_id INT,\n    customer_id INT,\n    order_date DATE,\n    CONSTRAINT pk_orders_order_id PRIMARY KEY (order_id)\n);\n```\n\nIn this example, the primary key constraint is named `pk_orders_order_id`."

                            "Constraint names are stored in the database's system catalog or data dictionary, which is a collection of metadata containing information about the database objects, such as tables, columns, indexes, and constraints. The system catalog varies between database management systems (DBMS) but usually consists of a set of system tables that store this metadata.\n\nFor example, in PostgreSQL, constraint information is stored in the `pg_constraint` table within the `pg_catalog` schema. In MySQL, the `information_schema` database holds the `KEY_COLUMN_USAGE` and `REFERENTIAL_CONSTRAINTS` tables, which store constraint information.\n\nYou can query these system tables to retrieve information about constraints in your database, such as their names, types, and associated tables and columns.\n\nHere's an example of how to retrieve constraint information in PostgreSQL:\n\n```sql\nSELECT conname, conrelid::regclass, confrelid::regclass, contype\nFROM pg_catalog.pg_constraint;\n```\n\nIn this query, `conname` represents the constraint name, `conrelid` represents the table associated with the constraint, `confrelid` represents the referenced table (for foreign key constraints), and `contype` represents the constraint type.\n\nSimilarly, in MySQL, you can retrieve constraint information using a query like this:\n\n```sql\nSELECT CONSTRAINT_NAME, TABLE_NAME, COLUMN_NAME, REFERENCED_TABLE_NAME, REFERENCED_COLUMN_NAME\nFROM information_schema.KEY_COLUMN_USAGE\nWHERE TABLE_SCHEMA = 'your_database_name';\n```\n\nThis query retrieves the constraint name, associated table, column, and referenced table and column (for foreign key constraints) from the `KEY_COLUMN_USAGE` table in the `information_schema` database.\n\nRemember to replace 'your_database_name' with the actual name of your database."

                            "To add a foreign key constraint to an existing table, you can use the `ALTER TABLE` statement along with the `ADD CONSTRAINT` clause. The syntax for adding a foreign key constraint is as follows:\n\n```sql\nALTER TABLE table_name\nADD CONSTRAINT constraint_name FOREIGN KEY (column_name)\nREFERENCES referenced_table (referenced_column);\n```\n\nHere's a breakdown of the syntax:\n\n- `table_name`: The name of the table where you want to add the foreign key constraint.\n- `constraint_name`: A custom name for the foreign key constraint (optional, but recommended for better readability and maintenance).\n- `column_name`: The name of the column in the `table_name` that will hold the foreign key value.\n- `referenced_table`: The name of the table that the foreign key refers to (i.e., the table containing the primary key).\n- `referenced_column`: The name of the column in the `referenced_table` that the foreign key column refers to (usually the primary key column).\n\nHere's an example of adding a foreign key constraint:\n\nSuppose you have two tables, `orders` and `customers`, with columns `order_id`, `customer_id`, and `order_date` in the `orders` table and `customer_id`, `first_name`, and `last_name` in the `customers` table. The `customer_id` in the `orders` table should reference the `customer_id` in the `customers` table. The SQL statement to add a foreign key constraint would look like this:\n\n```sql\nALTER TABLE orders\nADD CONSTRAINT fk_orders_customer_id FOREIGN KEY (customer_id)\nREFERENCES customers (customer_id);\n```\n\nIn this example, the foreign key constraint is named `fk_orders_customer_id`, and it ensures that each `customer_id` value in the `orders` table must have a corresponding `customer_id` value in the `customers` table."

Here's a general syntax for each join type:\n\n1. INNER JOIN:\n\n```sql\nSELECT column1, column2, ...\nFROM table1\nINNER JOIN table2 ON table1.column = table2.column;\n```\n\nAn INNER JOIN returns only the rows where there's a match in both tables based on the specified join condition.\n\n2. LEFT JOIN (also known as LEFT OUTER JOIN):\n\n```sql\nSELECT column1, column2, ...\nFROM table1\nLEFT JOIN table2 ON table1.column = table2.column;\n```\n\nA LEFT JOIN returns all rows from the left table (table1) and the matched rows from the right table (table2). If no match is found, NULL values are returned for the right table's columns.\n\n3. RIGHT JOIN (also known as RIGHT OUTER JOIN):\n\n```sql\nSELECT column1, column2, ...\nFROM table1\nRIGHT JOIN table2 ON table1.column = table2.column;\n```\n\nA RIGHT JOIN returns all rows from the right table (table2) and the matched rows from the left table (table1). If no match is found, NULL values are returned for the left table's columns.\n\n4. FULL OUTER JOIN:\n\n```sql\nSELECT column1, column2, ...\nFROM table1\nFULL OUTER JOIN table2 ON table1.column = table2.column;\n```\n\nA FULL OUTER JOIN returns all rows when there's a match in either the left table (table1) or the right table (table2). If no match is found, NULL values are returned for the columns where no match exists.\n\nRemember that the join condition specified with the ON keyword is critical for determining how the tables are joined. In these examples, `table1.column = table2.column` represents the condition on which the tables are joined."

                            "You can perform multiple joins in a single query to retrieve data from several tables. The syntax is similar to a single join, but you'll chain multiple JOIN clauses. Here's an example of a query with multiple joins using INNER JOIN:\n\n```sql\nSELECT t1.column1, t2.column2, t3.column3, ...\nFROM table1 t1\nINNER JOIN table2 t2 ON t1.columnA = t2.columnA\nINNER JOIN table3 t3 ON t2.columnB = t3.columnB;\n```\n\nIn this example, `table1` is joined with `table2` on the condition `t1.columnA = t2.columnA`, and `table2` is joined with `table3` on the condition `t2.columnB = t3.columnB`. You can replace `INNER JOIN` with other types of joins (LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, FULL OUTER JOIN) based on your specific requirements.\n\nRemember to replace `table1`, `table2`, and `table3` with your actual table names and update the column names and join conditions accordingly. Also, using table aliases (like `t1`, `t2`, `t3` in this example) can make your query more readable and easier to write."

                            "In the context of database views, the terms CREATE, UPDATE, and REPLACE refer to different actions you can perform to manage views. Here's a brief explanation of each:\n\n1. CREATE: The `CREATE VIEW` statement is used to create a new view based on the result of a SELECT query. The syntax is as follows:\n\n```sql\nCREATE VIEW view_name AS\nSELECT column1, column2, ...\nFROM table_name\nWHERE condition;\n```\n\nReplace `view_name` with your desired view name, and write a SELECT query to define the data that the view will represent.\n\n2. UPDATE: In the context of views, there's no direct `UPDATE VIEW` statement. However, you can update the underlying data of a view by updating the base tables used in the view. Note that this is possible only if the view is updatable (i.e., based on a single table, and not using aggregate functions, GROUP BY, or other operations that make the view non-updatable). To update the underlying data, you would use the standard `UPDATE` statement:\n\n```sql\nUPDATE table_name\nSET column1 = value1, column2 = value2, ...\nWHERE condition;\n```\n\n3. REPLACE: The `CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW` statement allows you to modify an existing view or create a new one if it doesn't exist. The syntax is as follows:\n\n```sql\nCREATE OR REPLACE VIEW view_name AS\nSELECT column1, column2, ...\nFROM table_name\nWHERE condition;\n```\n\nThis statement is useful when you want to change the SELECT query that defines the view or make other modifications. If the view already exists, the database system will replace it with the new definition. If the view doesn't exist, it will be created.\n\nRemember to replace `view_name`, `table_name`, column names, and conditions with your actual values based on your specific requirements."

Using `DROP` and `CREATE`: First, you drop the existing view using the `DROP VIEW` statement, and then create a new view using the `CREATE VIEW` statement.\n\n```sql\n-- Drop the existing view\nDROP VIEW view_name;\n\n-- Create a new view\nCREATE VIEW view_name AS\nSELECT column1, column2, ...\nFROM table_name\nWHERE condition;\n```\n\nBoth methods will redefine the view, but the first method (`CREATE OR REPLACE`) is generally more efficient and safer, as it performs both actions (replacing or creating) in a single statement. The second method (using `DROP` and `CREATE`) requires two separate statements, and there may be a brief period during which the view doesn't exist, which could cause issues if other queries or processes rely on the view during that time."

The database system will return the query execution plan, which might include information about table scans, index usage, join strategies, and other operations performed during query execution.\n\nHere's an example of how to use `EXPLAIN` with a simple query:\n\n```sql\nEXPLAIN SELECT * FROM employees WHERE salary > 50000;\n```\n\nIn PostgreSQL, you can use `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` to not only get the query plan but also execute the query and provide actual runtime statistics, which can be helpful for comparing the estimated plan to the actual execution:\n\n```sql\nEXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT * FROM employees WHERE salary > 50000;\n```\n\nKeep in mind that the output and specific features of the `EXPLAIN` command may vary between different database systems, so consult the documentation for your specific database system to understand the details and options available for the `EXPLAIN` command."

Replace `key_column` with the column(s) in both tables that you want to use for the match.\n\nReplace `table1`, `table2`, `key_column`, and the column names with your actual table and column names."

However, modern database systems often have query optimizers that automatically determine the most efficient join order, so you don't usually need to worry about this aspect.\n\nWhen you use other types of joins, such as LEFT JOIN or RIGHT JOIN, the order of the tables becomes more critical, as it determines which table is considered the \"left\" table and which is the \"right\" table. In a LEFT JOIN, for example, all rows from the left table are included in the result, even if there's no matching row in the right table.

                            "In SQL, an \"entity\" typically refers to a real-world object or concept that you want to represent in your database. Entities are often represented as tables in a relational database. While an entity in SQL can be similar to an object in object-oriented programming languages, there are some differences.\n\nHere's a comparison between entities in SQL and objects in object-oriented programming:\n\n1. Structure:\n   - Entities in SQL are represented as tables, with rows representing individual instances of the entity and columns representing attributes or properties of the entity.\n   - Objects in object-oriented programming are instances of classes, which define the structure and behavior of the object. Objects have properties (attributes) and methods (functions).\n\n2. Behavior:\n   - In SQL, entities do not have methods or behaviors associated with them. Instead, you manipulate the data within the entities using SQL commands, like SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE.\n   - In object-oriented programming, objects have methods that define the behaviors and operations that can be performed on the object.\n\n3. Relationships:\n   - In SQL, relationships between entities are represented using foreign keys, which link rows in one table to rows in another table.\n   - In object-oriented programming, relationships between objects can be represented through various means, such as object references, inheritance, or composition.\n\nIn summary, while entities in SQL and objects in object-oriented programming can both represent real-world concepts, their structure, behavior, and relationships are represented and managed differently. Entities in SQL are more focused on the structure and relationships of the data, while objects in object-oriented programming combine both structure and behavior."

                            "Objects in Python are like little containers that can hold information and perform actions related to that information. Think of objects like characters in a video game: each character has some properties (like name, health, and strength) and can perform actions (like run, jump, or attack).\n\nIn Python, we create objects using \"classes.\" Classes are like blueprints or templates that describe what an object can store and what actions it can perform. For example, we could have a `Dog` class that represents dogs in a simple program. The `Dog` class could have properties like `name`, `age`, and `breed`, and actions (which we call \"methods\" in Python) like `bark` and `wag_tail`.\n\nHere's a simple example of a `Dog` class in Python:\n\n```python\nclass Dog:\n    def __init__(self, name, age, breed):\n        self.name = name\n        self.age = age\n        self.breed = breed\n\n    def bark(self):\n        print(f\"{self.name} says: Woof!\")\n\n    def wag_tail(self):\n        print(f\"{self.name} is wagging its tail!\")\n```\n\nThe `__init__` method is like a constructor that sets up a new dog object with its name, age, and breed. The `bark` and `wag_tail` methods are actions that the dog can perform.\n\nNow, let's say we want to create a dog object for a Golden Retriever named Buddy who is 3 years old:\n\n```python\nbuddy = Dog(\"Buddy\", 3, \"Golden Retriever\")\n```\n\nNow we have a `Dog` object named `buddy`. We can access its properties and use its methods like this:\n\n```python\nprint(buddy.name)  # Output: Buddy\nprint(buddy.age)   # Output: 3\nprint(buddy.breed) # Output: Golden Retriever\n\nbuddy.bark()       # Output: Buddy says: Woof!\nbuddy.wag_tail()   # Output: Buddy is wagging its tail!\n```\n\nIn summary, objects in Python are like little containers that store information and can perform actions. We use classes to define the structure and behavior of objects, and then we create instances of those classes (like `buddy`) to represent specific objects in our program."

                            "In SQL, the `DROP` statement is used to delete objects such as tables, databases, or other elements from the database. The syntax for dropping objects depends on the type of object you want to remove. Here are some examples of the `DROP` syntax for common objects:\n\n1. Drop a table:\n\n```sql\nDROP TABLE table_name;\n```\n\nReplace `table_name` with the name of the table you want to delete.\n\n2. Drop a database:\n\n```sql\nDROP DATABASE database_name;\n```\n\nReplace `database_name` with the name of the database you want to delete.\n\n3. Drop an index:\n\n```sql\nDROP INDEX index_name;\n```\n\nReplace `index_name` with the name of the index you want to delete.\n\n4. Drop a view:\n\n```sql\nDROP VIEW view_name;\n```\n\nReplace `view_name` with the name of the view you want to delete.\n\nKeep in mind that using the `DROP` statement will permanently delete the specified object and all the data associated with it. Make sure to backup any important data before executing a `DROP` statement.\n\nAdditionally, some database systems might require extra options or slightly different syntax to drop objects, so it's a good idea to consult the documentation for your specific database system for any variations or additional options."

The syntax for dropping a column is as follows:\n\n```sql\nALTER TABLE table_name\nDROP COLUMN column_name;\n```\n\nReplace `table_name` with the name of the table you want to modify, and `column_name` with the name of the column you want to remove.\n\nFor example, if you have a table called `employees` and you want to remove the column `phone_number`, you would use the following SQL statement:\n\n```sql\nALTER TABLE employees\nDROP COLUMN phone_number;\n```\n\nKeep in mind that when you drop a column, all the data stored in that column will be permanently deleted. Make sure to backup any important data before executing a `DROP COLUMN` statement.\n\nIt's also important to note that not all database systems support the `DROP COLUMN` clause. Some older systems, like SQLite (prior to version 3.25.0), do not have native support for dropping columns, and you need to follow a more complex procedure, such as creating a new table without the unwanted column, copying the data, and then renaming the new table.

The `INNER JOIN` operation returns all rows from both tables that have matching values in the specified columns.\n\n3. **ON**: The `ON` clause specifies the condition for the join. In this case, it's based on matching values in the `id` columns of both tables (`left_table.id = right_table.id`). The query compares each row from the `left_table` to each row in the `right_table`, and if the `id` values match, it combines the rows and includes them in the result set.\n\n4. **SELECT**: The `SELECT` clause defines which columns to return in the final result set. The `*` symbol is a wildcard that means \"all columns.\" Since the query is joining two tables, the result will include all columns from both `left_table` and `right_table` for each matching row.\n\nAfter all these steps, the final result set is produced, containing all columns from both `left_table` and `right_table` where the `id` values match."

The query would produce the same result regardless of which table is used in the `FROM` clause and which table is used in the `INNER JOIN` clause.\n\nYou could rewrite the query with the tables reversed, like this:\n\n```sql\nSELECT c1.name AS city, c2.name AS country\nFROM countries AS c2\nINNER JOIN cities AS c1\nON c1.country_code = c2.code;\n```\n\nThe result would be the same in both cases because the `INNER JOIN` operation combines rows from both tables based on the condition specified in the `ON` clause (`c1.country_code = c2.code`).\n\nIn practice, you can choose either table for the `FROM` clause based on personal preference, readability, or consistency in your codebase. Some developers might prefer to put the table with fewer rows in the `FROM` clause and the table with more rows in the `JOIN` clause, but this is not a requirement, and the query optimizer in the database system will typically choose the most efficient way to execute the query regardless of the order of the tables in the SQL statement."

                            "Summarize key points:\n\n- Brady the BA has a new fellow BA on the team, Blair, and is noticing some very different approaches to getting requirements done. Brady has seen that Blair is rarely at her desk. Frankly, Brady doesn't understand how Blair is actually getting the work done, but hears about how the project Blair is on is pretty cool and the team is getting a lot of praise for their work. Brady got curious and asked Blair more about her approach and the team's work style. Blair explained her team focuses on co-creating. They create meaningful dialog, diagrams and visuals together that focus on the intent of what they want to build as a team. Brady recognizes this as quite a shift from the idea of creating everything alone and then seeking approvals for the work. Business needs are emergent, and in many cases, no matter how well defined a solution seems at the beginning co-creating requirements needs to be a part of the process. It can be a faster process when done well and done right. Co-creating means that we work together on the big picture and the details of the requirements. We work together to discover requirements. It's not about sitting at our desks, cranking out documents and hoping for approval. It's about co-creating the future together and then documenting what was discussed. Co-creating is a key skill for business analysts. As it involves a mindset that embodies teamwork and collaboration in getting requirements done. Let's start with the big picture. The customer and the team create a shared understanding of what the vision of a solution is, why it's being built, what the goals are, the objectives and the rough scope. They discuss the outcomes, what the solution is looking to achieve and how it will be measured. After a big picture is understood, the details can be worked on. The business analyst leads the process for the team to co-create this big picture and the details together. Co-creating is a skill in combining facilitation skills, conversation skills and coaching a team through the process of learning and discovery. When you get down to the details of co-creating, in business analysis it involves things like defining goals and objectives, defining hypotheses and experiments, getting the team to have deep conversations about what's valuable and facilitating dialog about options and alternatives. Co-creating is a leadership skill business analysts use to drive innovation in ambiguous and changing contexts, which are all too common today. Co-creating is all about maximizing the team and the individual contributions. It's key to the future as we continue to strive for excellence in an ever-changing landscape. Co-creating helps bring BAs into the realm of a leadership role and elevates what BAs control to teams."

                            "- When you meet with a stakeholder, are you able to pinpoint the emotion they're carrying into a meeting? And how about after the meeting? During a requirements workshop, can you scan the room and see who's excited and nervous and fearful? The ability to establish rapport and empathy with really anyone you is a key BA skill. Brady, the BA, is preparing to meet with a stakeholder, and he has some apprehensions because the last time they met, it was a bit rough. This stakeholder is, well, let's just say a difficult personality. So Brady is working on trying to prepare for the meeting by thinking through how to build better rapport and ensuring there's empathy to connect better. Brady realized that in previous meetings the focus was on the task to be completed and needed more focus on connecting with the stakeholder. Brady had a feeling afterwards that the stakeholders weren't happy with the requirements process and they're not trusting the process. When rapport and empathy are positively happening, the results and outcomes are relationships that survive the many challenges teams face. When rapport and empathy are in place, your stakeholders are in a position to be receptive to new ideas, to new is new ways of working, and to trust the process you lead them through. To build rapport and empathy with stakeholders, we need to truly understand what motivates them and where their challenges are. It means being in tune to what matters to each stakeholder, what's happening in their world, and what perceptions they have about the work you and the team do. On my projects, I need to work hard to establish, build, and maintain rapport and empathy with the team. It's not an easy endeavor. Two tips that I have for Brady and for you are: First, be a listener and ask powerful questions in every encounter you have. Things like, tell me about the pain points with the current solution, and what does success look like from your perspective? These questions can be asked in just about any requirements or project meeting. These are the types of questions that bring out a different perspective. I like to use these questions whenever I find myself in a situation where the focus of the dialogue is going in the wrong direction, like too much talk about the how, when I want to discuss the what and the why. Second, make sure that your interpretation of what's being discussed matches their intended message. It's easy to listen and interpret where we hear things based on our own experiences and miss the point the others are trying to make. Try out statements like, so what I'm hearing is, and am I hearing it correctly? Also, look for the emotion in what's being said and how can your reaction and dialogue acknowledge, respect, and respond showing empathy? For example, in a requirements workshop Brady was in, the difficult stakeholder was complaining about all the requirements meetings and how hard it is to fit them into a schedule. In this situation, Brady listened to a stakeholder vent and complain about the challenge. It's easy for Brady to take it personally, but before responding, Brady makes sure to identify the emotion behind the words. Are they frustrated, confused, or feeling like they haven't been heard, or maybe it's something else? It's important that Brady acknowledge their emotion and confirm understanding of what they're intending to communicate. It can be tempting to jump into facts and circumstances. (chuckles) Brady isn't fooled. This is likely to push away the stakeholder and dissolve any rapport and empathy Brady has built. Building rapport and empathy is about being in tune with someone. It's about connecting with what matters to them rather than our own agenda. Building great report empathy is rewarding in many ways and contributes to great requirements and results."

                            "- When you meet with a stakeholder, are you able to pinpoint the emotion they're carrying into a meeting? And how about after the meeting? During a requirements workshop, can you scan the room and see who's excited and nervous and fearful? The ability to establish rapport and empathy with really anyone you is a key BA skill. Brady, the BA, is preparing to meet with a stakeholder, and he has some apprehensions because the last time they met, it was a bit rough. This stakeholder is, well, let's just say a difficult personality. So Brady is working on trying to prepare for the meeting by thinking through how to build better rapport and ensuring there's empathy to connect better. Brady realized that in previous meetings the focus was on the task to be completed and needed more focus on connecting with the stakeholder. Brady had a feeling afterwards that the stakeholders weren't happy with the requirements process and they're not trusting the process. When rapport and empathy are positively happening, the results and outcomes are relationships that survive the many challenges teams face. When rapport and empathy are in place, your stakeholders are in a position to be receptive to new ideas, to new is new ways of working, and to trust the process you lead them through. To build rapport and empathy with stakeholders, we need to truly understand what motivates them and where their challenges are. It means being in tune to what matters to each stakeholder, what's happening in their world, and what perceptions they have about the work you and the team do. On my projects, I need to work hard to establish, build, and maintain rapport and empathy with the team. It's not an easy endeavor. Two tips that I have for Brady and for you are: First, be a listener and ask powerful questions in every encounter you have. Things like, tell me about the pain points with the current solution, and what does success look like from your perspective? These questions can be asked in just about any requirements or project meeting. These are the types of questions that bring out a different perspective. I like to use these questions whenever I find myself in a situation where the focus of the dialogue is going in the wrong direction, like too much talk about the how, when I want to discuss the what and the why. Second, make sure that your interpretation of what's being discussed matches their intended message. It's easy to listen and interpret where we hear things based on our own experiences and miss the point the others are trying to make. Try out statements like, so what I'm hearing is, and am I hearing it correctly? Also, look for the emotion in what's being said and how can your reaction and dialogue acknowledge, respect, and respond showing empathy? For example, in a requirements workshop Brady was in, the difficult stakeholder was complaining about all the requirements meetings and how hard it is to fit them into a schedule. In this situation, Brady listened to a stakeholder vent and complain about the challenge. It's easy for Brady to take it personally, but before responding, Brady makes sure to identify the emotion behind the words. Are they frustrated, confused, or feeling like they haven't been heard, or maybe it's something else? It's important that Brady acknowledge their emotion and confirm understanding of what they're intending to communicate. It can be tempting to jump into facts and circumstances. (chuckles) Brady isn't fooled. This is likely to push away the stakeholder and dissolve any rapport and empathy Brady has built. Building rapport and empathy is about being in tune with someone. It's about connecting with what matters to them rather than our own agenda. Building great report empathy is rewarding in many ways and contributes to great requirements and results."

                            "- Great BAs are leaders, and leaders know how to influence. You may not have thought of the BA role as a leader but many do. And many leaders are expecting BAs to rise to the occasion and be leaders. Business analysts typically don't have the type of power positions to influence with authority. And so they need to rely on influencing without authority. And there are so many ways to influence without authority, and so many situations where it's needed. Some situations as a business analyst when influence is needed are times like influencing stakeholders to expand their solution ideas beyond the first idea they have, and helping key stakeholders make decisions by having options and alternatives matching their needs and ready for them. Or perhaps getting others to do things as action items when you don't have any authority over their priorities. Some ways to influence without authority as a business analyst are. First, understand why many resist change, and when people are receptive. This requires us to be in tune with the emotions, and motivations of others. It requires us to understand another perspective, and look at what needs to be addressed before we can be receptive to change. Next, understand what their challenges are, and what motivates them. This requires us to be in tune with others, and understand their currency. Their currency is what motivates them. For example, does money motivate? Or maybe be praised in front of others. Or perhaps respect from a specific person with recognition from them. Finally, through the trust you have, and built understanding of these items, gauge the receptiveness and discuss the benefits to the change in a way that acknowledges, and challenges and helps the stakeholder get to acceptance. It may not be a quick process. For example, if a stakeholder is resistant to changing their process to make a new cloud software work, as a BA, you'll need to build trust and rapport with them so they feel comfortable discussing why they're resistant. Once they open up, then the reasons for resistance can be recognized, and together, you'll find ways to identify the benefits of the change while acknowledging the challenges. The stakeholder will likely see many benefits, and start to process their challenge differently. Opening up to ideas that they weren't previously open to. Through this process, building trust and understanding what matters most to a stakeholder is absolutely critical to them being receptive and open to new ideas. Influencing takes practice. It takes patient and a focused approach. with a little work, you can influence to get great results."

                            "- I hear a lot of BAs complain that decision-making is slow in their organizations and it can take forever for stakeholders to make decisions or they change their mind a lot. While the root cause of this may be outside the BAs realm, there also maybe a lot BAs can do to help the situation. One way to describe the main job of a BA is to facilitate decision-making. As BAs, much of our work is helping leaders and those impacted by a change make all the decisions needed to ideate, analyze, plan for, innovate and accept the change. Just about everything we do is about helping others make decisions. Requirements at every level of detail are decisions that teams make to create their future. Requirements and designs are the details that describe the future state and the decisions about people, processes and systems that make up the desired future state of a solution. To help our stakeholders make effective decisions, we need to do a few things. First, understand the decision-making process. Next, understand how to evaluate what information is needed to make decisions. And then, how to read leaders in what they need to make a decision. And last, how to present the information to leaders so they can make a decision. So what's all involved in this? Understanding the decisions to be made, who makes them and the layers of details about those decisions. For example, let's look at something seemingly simple. You are the analyst for a popular restaurant who will now be adding pizza to the delivery menu. So many decisions to be made to make this happen. Things like what container will the pizzas be carried in? How long must the pizza be warm for? What temperature should it be at? And how sturdy should that container be? You see where I'm going here? The organization you work in I know is likely far more complex and with more complex processes, but a system or many systems are involved in managing and ordering inventory and supplies of each container, predicting inventory needed and determining for each order what type of container should be used. This could be a manual or automated system and the requirements are there to help the process run smoothly. These are all decisions that are made many times each day. A BA creates that dialogue to get all these decisions discussed and then outlines all the decisions, the process and the rules that go with them. Then, the leaders and stakeholders need to validate that these are the right decisions. So how do you know you're effective at helping stakeholders make these decisions? Well, you know when decisions are made quickly when the right information and people are involved. Also, the decision reduces risk and uncertainty and stakeholders are satisfied with the decisions. And last, the team and stakeholders feel the decision is important to the outcomes they need. Decision-making and facilitating decisions is a huge part of business analysis. And with this skill, you will help leaders shape the future of the organization."

It's also quite common for more than half of his time to be wasted by poorly facilitated meetings. This resonates with Brady the BA, as about half of his day is hosting meetings about requirements. Facilitating meetings is about making sure the meeting makes good use of everyone's time, it meets the objective, and an objective is something that everyone in the meeting cares about. Meeting facilitation skills are something that we learn and grow in throughout our careers, from small simple meetings to high-stakes decision meetings. The first part of any meeting facilitation is the prep. Brady doesn't have much time for prep. It often gets put aside for other priorities. Over the years, Brady has learned that meeting prep is everything and now makes a huge difference in the success of the meeting. Brady used to simply create an agenda, but wasn't sure if it had meaningful purpose, and if the objective was on track. Now, Brady's agendas have a purpose, an objective, and meaningful activities and topics. A good purpose describes why the meeting is needed. For example, to discuss and uncover areas where the user workflow is impacted by the new product type being added. And a good objective describes the outcome of the meeting. For example, by the end of the meeting, the user workflow impact for Customer Service is complete and a plan to address the other user groups is established. Many meeting objectives include a decision to be made. In this situation, be sure to state clearly in the objective what decisions are to be made and who the contributors are to the decision. Besides knowing who the decision makers are, in the meeting, make sure you also have clear roles, roles like subject matter expert, impacted groups, and decision maker. When creating the objective and purpose, notice that I use phrasing that helps participants connect to their own work, rather than the objective being about my work as a BA, like complete requirements document section 1.B. This gives a what's-in-it-for-me factor from each meeting participant's perspective. Next, when determining the topics and activities in the meeting, think through what will each person get or how will they benefit from the meeting? This helps us create a meeting that is engaging and meaningful to others, not just ourselves. Also, think through how the topic can be phrased, so the dialogue gets to the right conversation. For example, instead of review scope, try determine and discuss what's in and out of scope. It's also important to strategically plan how we'll facilitate each topic. Think about asking yourself questions like, will you provide a one-page summary or visual for the topic, or is there a decision to be made? And is there an activity to get everyone engaged, like a collaborative game, brainstorming, or a visual modeling activity? And last, make sure everyone is heard is a critical part of meeting facilitation. And this also means drawing out those that may not naturally speak up. There are all sorts of meeting activities to help engage everyone and create a safe environment, so everyone feels comfortable participating. I've provided an exercise file with some resources for you. Brady, like many BAs, knows facilitating meetings is a crucial skill that will always be an opportunity to learn more and continue improving. Keep learning, experimenting, and discovering new tricks and techniques to keep you on top of your game."

                            "- BAs facilitate a lot of meetings, and this is a big responsibility. The cost of meetings a BA facilitates each year can easily exceed a million US dollars. It's also quite common for more than half of his time to be wasted by poorly facilitated meetings. This resonates with Brady the BA, as about half of his day is hosting meetings about requirements. Facilitating meetings is about making sure the meeting makes good use of everyone's time, it meets the objective, and an objective is something that everyone in the meeting cares about. Meeting facilitation skills are something that we learn and grow in throughout our careers, from small simple meetings to high-stakes decision meetings. The first part of any meeting facilitation is the prep. Brady doesn't have much time for prep. It often gets put aside for other priorities. Over the years, Brady has learned that meeting prep is everything and now makes a huge difference in the success of the meeting. Brady used to simply create an agenda, but wasn't sure if it had meaningful purpose, and if the objective was on track. Now, Brady's agendas have a purpose, an objective, and meaningful activities and topics. A good purpose describes why the meeting is needed. For example, to discuss and uncover areas where the user workflow is impacted by the new product type being added. And a good objective describes the outcome of the meeting. For example, by the end of the meeting, the user workflow impact for Customer Service is complete and a plan to address the other user groups is established. Many meeting objectives include a decision to be made. In this situation, be sure to state clearly in the objective what decisions are to be made and who the contributors are to the decision. Besides knowing who the decision makers are, in the meeting, make sure you also have clear roles, roles like subject matter expert, impacted groups, and decision maker. When creating the objective and purpose, notice that I use phrasing that helps participants connect to their own work, rather than the objective being about my work as a BA, like complete requirements document section 1.B. This gives a what's-in-it-for-me factor from each meeting participant's perspective. Next, when determining the topics and activities in the meeting, think through what will each person get or how will they benefit from the meeting? This helps us create a meeting that is engaging and meaningful to others, not just ourselves. Also, think through how the topic can be phrased, so the dialogue gets to the right conversation. For example, instead of review scope, try determine and discuss what's in and out of scope. It's also important to strategically plan how we'll facilitate each topic. Think about asking yourself questions like, will you provide a one-page summary or visual for the topic, or is there a decision to be made? And is there an activity to get everyone engaged, like a collaborative game, brainstorming, or a visual modeling activity? And last, make sure everyone is heard is a critical part of meeting facilitation. And this also means drawing out those that may not naturally speak up. There are all sorts of meeting activities to help engage everyone and create a safe environment, so everyone feels comfortable participating. I've provided an exercise file with some resources for you. Brady, like many BAs, knows facilitating meetings is a crucial skill that will always be an opportunity to learn more and continue improving. Keep learning, experimenting, and discovering new tricks and techniques to keep you on top of your game."

                            "- The power of a BA with great data skills lies in being able to align the data with the customer experience and strategic insights. It's like having a crystal ball that no one else can see. Data analysis can mean a lot of different things to BAs, and we'll look at many of the ways BAs use analyze data for better requirements. Overall, it means being able to understand and identify the data, discover the meaning of the data, define the data relationships, and connect disparate data to gain insights. It involves making sense of data from multiple angles, and it's more than reading the data in simple analysis. It's understanding complex relationships, large data sets, trends in the data, patterns, and ultimately figuring out what data matters most to providing value. Brady, the BA, has never really had to understand data as a BA, but he is landed on a project that data skills are needed as a focus and Brady has to learn quick. The interesting thing is that Brady had insights into problems and challenges from years of BA experience that would've been easier to solve had the data skills been present at the time. It's like data skills allow us to see what's invisible without them. With the updated skillset related to data, Brady's work improved in many ways. First, the data flow. Brady's projects improved via assumed data flow that many users don't discuss, they just expect it. Data flow is about analyzing the flow of data through a system and the user's experience with your product. Poor data flow has users reentering the same information multiple times or not having the information present when they need it. Next, data relationships. Brady now sees data connections that previously weren't obvious, solving defect issues and user complaints quicker. Data relationships drive the data architecture, the data architecture consists of the boundaries of how data relates to other data. For example, as an instructor, I can have many students. If the data architecture says that as an instructor I can only have one student, this would limit the system's capabilities and the experience of a student and myself as the instructor, the value wouldn't materialize for anyone. Next is data definitions. Brady is now more careful to define even basic data, like order and customer, preventing errors from different definitions being used in integrated systems. Data definitions that are about consistently defining data about products, customers, and processes. Data definitions seem so simple yet cause so many issues, we take them for granted. For example, how do you define customer? I love asking big companies this question, it's tough to answer. Executives and system teams tend to have different answers and this can cause problems. If one team or system defines customer as someone with an account, and another team or a system defines customer as a potential account holder or maybe former account holder, the organization will struggle to serve customers consistently. BAs help teams define and stay consistent with data definitions. The fourth way Brady uses data is data research. Brady learned to research real data, to look for patterns and data insights to put context around what users were talking about. BAs often need to research data, current and historical, to understand patterns in a product, market, operational and customer behaviors. And last, data insights and trends, understanding what story the data tells us. This is about taking the research and knowing what data matters. We can do tons of research and have enormous amounts of data, the question really is, what data provides us meaningful insights to improve the products or customers experience with us as an organization. Understanding data is a big part of being a great BA. Keep learning and building data skills to enhance your results."

                            "Running data mining on the entire dataset can be problematic for several reasons:\n\n1. Computational complexity: Large datasets require more computational power and resources to process. Running data mining algorithms on the entire dataset can be resource-intensive, time-consuming, and may even lead to system crashes if the hardware cannot handle the load.\n\n2. Overfitting: When data mining algorithms are applied to the entire dataset, there is a risk of overfitting. Overfitting occurs when a model becomes too tailored to the specific data points in the training dataset, reducing its ability to generalize to new, unseen data. This can lead to poor performance when the model is applied to real-world situations.\n\n3. Noise and outliers: Large datasets often contain noise and outliers, which can negatively impact the performance of data mining algorithms. Running data mining on the entire dataset may result in models that are influenced by these noisy data points, leading to less accurate or less reliable outcomes.\n\n4. Data quality issues: Large datasets may contain duplicate, missing, or inconsistent data. Running data mining on the entire dataset without first addressing these data quality issues can lead to incorrect or misleading results.\n\nTo mitigate these problems, data mining practitioners often use a combination of techniques such as data preprocessing, feature selection, dimensionality reduction, and sampling. These methods help reduce the size and complexity of the dataset, allowing for more efficient and accurate data mining while minimizing the risk of overfitting and other issues."

                            "In data science, both program managers and project managers play important roles in ensuring the successful completion of tasks and objectives. However, their responsibilities and areas of focus differ. Here are the key distinctions between the two roles:\n\n1. Scope and focus:\n- Program Manager: A program manager oversees a collection of related projects or initiatives that work towards a common strategic goal. Their focus is on the overall coordination and alignment of the projects, ensuring that they contribute to the organization's strategic objectives. Program managers often manage multiple projects simultaneously and work with various project managers to ensure alignment and proper resource allocation.\n- Project Manager: A project manager is responsible for the planning, execution, monitoring, and closure of a single project. Their focus is on meeting the project's specific objectives, adhering to the timeline, and staying within the allocated budget. They manage the day-to-day tasks, coordinate with team members, and communicate progress to stakeholders.\n\n2. Decision-making and strategic planning:\n- Program Manager: Program managers make high-level strategic decisions and establish the vision, goals, and priorities for the program. They need to understand the organization's overall strategy and ensure that the program's projects align with that strategy. They also make decisions related to resource allocation, risk management, and change management across the entire program.\n- Project Manager: Project managers make tactical decisions related to their specific project. This includes creating project plans, assigning tasks, managing risks, and addressing any issues that arise during the project lifecycle. They are responsible for ensuring the successful completion of their project within the given constraints (time, budget, scope).\n\n3. Stakeholder management:\n- Program Manager: Program managers engage with high-level stakeholders, such as executives or sponsors, to secure support and resources for the program. They need to effectively communicate the program's progress, benefits, and strategic alignment to ensure continued buy-in and support.\n- Project Manager: Project managers interact with stakeholders specific to their project, including team members, sponsors, and clients. They must keep stakeholders informed about the project's progress, address concerns, and manage expectations.\n\n4. Time horizon:\n- Program Manager: Program managers usually have a longer-term perspective, as they focus on the broader program and its strategic objectives. They need to think about how individual projects contribute to the overall program and how they align with the organization's long-term goals.\n- Project Manager: Project managers work within a shorter time horizon, focusing on the successful completion of their project. They must ensure that project milestones and deadlines are met and that the project delivers the expected outcomes.\n\nIn summary, program managers are responsible for managing and aligning a collection of related projects, while project managers focus on the successful completion of a single project. Program managers have a more strategic role, and project managers are more involved in the tactical execution of tasks within their specific project."

We both face the daily ins and outs, trying to strike a balance between our vision and values while making decisions to keep everything running smoothly, safely, and relevant. It's cool to see how much we have in common! I enjoyed talking with you, and it was really productive. Looking forward to more chats like this!"

But I don't not know enough of the variables, nor do I think it's helpful to say, \"This is what happened, and this is what you should do, and this is what should change.\" I'm just putting it out there because these impacts have had enough intensity and frequency to get me to the point that I am begging you for the use of your valuable time.\nSo, I'm not here to relive and criticize. I'm just hoping to be helpful. This is like a debrief of the school year. That's all. But I don't want to minimize how important it is. I'm begging for your valuable time because it has had such an impact on consistency and the ability to learn.\nWhen half my students are unable to continue work or, even worse, when only two people aren't, it's very hard to just go on with class because I have to physically be tech support at the same time but often and I am not even allowed to fix the most common problem i've had, and I only get them for a short period of time. So when 2 kids can\u2019t sign in, everyone has to wait. I have to move forward. And one of the things that I hate, and I am adamantly against, but am not perfect with myself but better than most , is allowing free time. However, these situations have left me so exhausted and mentally drained, or I'm left with no choice but to say, that I must say, \"Okay, do whatever while I try to get this sorted.\" And I am not talking about regular problems, this is in addition to regular problems.\nAnd all of this is contained within a larger context - so Let me just start with the context I'm coming from. It's important to keep this in mind as I move forward. I don't have a curriculum I am forced to use. I must invent my own, and while I enjoy doing that, having to do it all the time and having to use free trials and hopping to another free trial and then students come back next year and we\u2019ve already used up a free trial on the one free course so I have to find, and vet, and or build new stuff all the time. All the while wondering where the districts help on this - it free money for exactly what I need and  it is sitting there and no one seems to want to lift a finger or help.  I don't have any curriculum, and I don't have money to purchase one. And this has been the case for years.\nAnd I have been asking for a grant for years. 50000 in money at  this point, since 2018, and it hasn't been or lack of trying, - the responses i get are either school board (why did that happen more than once) or no response at all. This grant is a massive undertaking. \nSo, this leads me to the first issue, within that larger context. Which concerns me moving forward, and this is why I said to you that I don't know if a computer science program is sustainable without the proper resources. Maybe we don't need it, and I'm open to that. But here I am, getting sidetracked. I don't have a curriculum, I don't have money for it, and the furthest back I could look, I found an email exchange from 2016 asking about a grant that got denied. In 2018, there was a conversation between me and you, Roger, but we couldn't get in front of the school board. I found emails to Teresa Hamilton that were not replied to, and more recently, you, Holly, I talked to you about it, but the month I had to get it done turned into a week, then two weeks, and then the whole plan got screwed up, so we didn't do it.\nSo, I have no money, no curriculum, and over 100 students a day, six classes, and three grade levels. \n\n\nTo give you perspective, every other content teacher here has four classes, one grade level, and they're teaching the same thing four times a day. I'm teaching six classes, three grade levels, which is very often three different things a day. Sometimes more similar, sometimes it's not. But it's still dealing with different kids and different presentations. That's the context, and this is why this grant has been so important to me.\nWith all the rigors of teaching three different classes and then doing other tasks, I'm working eight hours a day on Sundays, trying to find something new or invent something new, without resources.  So, this is why I needed this grant so badly. \nI'm demoralized and defeated by the lack of enthusiasm at the district office as a whole to help me with that. In that context, let me share an example.\nWhen the new computers came in, there were a lot of problems. For instance, the kids couldn't use the new keyboards and mice, so I had to get adapters to use the old ones. \nAnother significant issue was the red dot problem, That fuck that red dot plagued us for years. And when we got the new computers, same thing fucking happened. It was like, Throwing days. I was trying to Offer. More options than Google sweet and programming. 3d design, And, actual applications of code, like, c plus C, sharp. Many 3d productions that are built with unity. Graphic art and design. Music, digital music production.But all those things require saving files locally which we couldn't rely on because of the red dot.  Random kids on random days can't sign in. 6 classes a day. It becomes Maddening. Defeating. And it's like, the whole class just starts losing enthusiasm. So I gave up on the advanced class because it was like rolling dice every day, are kids gonna be able to get their work back?\nIt took two or three weeks just to get someone to get in here, and we fixed it in like an hour.\n I started the project off with a \u201cgam jam\u201d in a game engine that the kids used last year. I built a web page, where all these other game jams were for people just starting out, I hosted them at a place where they made a page, and I put a theme up. So, I was doing that.  They had free assets, like you could just download free stuff. It was like a close-knit community, similar to the forums in the old days when they were used more. It was kind of like that, a community. And then, there were actually educational tools. This is critical. You have to build this story because when he finds out that it got banned for wrong reasons, and everything he's heard about it has nothing to do with horror, it's going to be impactful.\nI found this great tool. It's a 20-lesson coding course that teaches you, and then it has you solve coding challenges to get to the next level. It was great because we had this new engine. I forget what it's called now, but it's a version that's like Python. And then, one day, we come in, and it's gone. The site, the progress, and the curriculum. I called Lisa. \"Where is it?\" We didn't find out until two days later. I get an email from you telling me it's inappropriate for children because there are horror links. What do you think that does? And it's been gone since. What do you think that does to kids' enthusiasm?\n\n\nPlease write in English language."

                            "please provide at least one bullet point sentence for each paragraph in this statement:\n\n\nThank you. I am going to stand so I can use the computer. First of all, I have you for half an hour, and I don't know how much time I'm going to use talking. \nBut I'm going to take advantage of having you here, and it's important that I share with you the events or processes that have taken place.I'm also going to share with you how it has impacted us as a class and the students especially. \nThese are things that have already happened, and though they were significant,  I'm not here to relive them or point fingers. I'm not even here to demand solutions. I'm solely here to help inform future decision-making. If all I get to do here is relay this information, shake your hands, and go about  today, that will be a success for me.\nIf I were in your seat right now, listening to what I'm about to say, I would feel the need to offer reasons or explanations. But I don't not know enough of the variables, nor do I think it's helpful to say, \"This is what happened, and this is what you should do, and this is what should change.\" I'm just putting it out there because these impacts have had enough intensity and frequency to get me to the point that I am begging you for the use of your valuable time.\nSo, I'm not here to relive and criticize. I'm just hoping to be helpful. This is like a debrief of the school year. That's all. But I don't want to minimize how important it is. I'm begging for your valuable time because it has had such an impact on consistency and the ability to learn.\nWhen half my students are unable to continue work or, even worse, when only two people aren't, it's very hard to just go on with class because I have to physically be tech support at the same time but often and I am not even allowed to fix the most common problem i've had, and I only get them for a short period of time. So when 2 kids can\u2019t sign in, everyone has to wait. I have to move forward. And one of the things that I hate, and I am adamantly against, but am not perfect with myself but better than most , is allowing free time. However, these situations have left me so exhausted and mentally drained, or I'm left with no choice but to say, that I must say, \"Okay, do whatever while I try to get this sorted.\" And I am not talking about regular problems, this is in addition to regular problems.\nAnd all of this is contained within a larger context - so Let me just start with the context I'm coming from. It's important to keep this in mind as I move forward. I don't have a curriculum I am forced to use. I must invent my own, and while I enjoy doing that, having to do it all the time and having to use free trials and hopping to another free trial and then students come back next year and we\u2019ve already used up a free trial on the one free course so I have to find, and vet, and or build new stuff all the time. All the while wondering where the districts help on this - it free money for exactly what I need and  it is sitting there and no one seems to want to lift a finger or help.  I don't have any curriculum, and I don't have money to purchase one. And this has been the case for years.\nAnd I have been asking for a grant for years. 50000 in money at  this point, since 2018, and it hasn't been or lack of trying, - the responses i get are either school board (why did that happen more than once) or no response at all. This grant is a massive undertaking. \nSo, this leads me to the first issue, within that larger context. Which concerns me moving forward, and this is why I said to you that I don't know if a computer science program is sustainable without the proper resources. Maybe we don't need it, and I'm open to that. But here I am, getting sidetracked. I don't have a curriculum, I don't have money for it, and the furthest back I could look, I found an email exchange from 2016 asking about a grant that got denied. In 2018, there was a conversation between me and you, Roger, but we couldn't get in front of the school board. I found emails to Teresa Hamilton that were not replied to, and more recently, you, Holly, I talked to you about it, but the month I had to get it done turned into a week, then two weeks, and then the whole plan got screwed up, so we didn't do it.\nSo, I have no money, no curriculum, and over 100 students a day, six classes, and three grade levels. \n\n\nTo give you perspective, every other content teacher here has four classes, one grade level, and they're teaching the same thing four times a day. I'm teaching six classes, three grade levels, which is very often three different things a day. Sometimes more similar, sometimes it's not. But it's still dealing with different kids and different presentations. That's the context, and this is why this grant has been so important to me.\nWith all the rigors of teaching three different classes and then doing other tasks, I'm working eight hours a day on Sundays, trying to find something new or invent something new, without resources.  So, this is why I needed this grant so badly. \nI'm demoralized and defeated by the lack of enthusiasm at the district office as a whole to help me with that. In that context, let me share an example.\nWhen the new computers came in, there were a lot of problems. For instance, the kids couldn't use the new keyboards and mice, so I had to get adapters to use the old ones. \nAnother significant issue was the red dot problem, That fuck that red dot plagued us for years. And when we got the new computers, same thing fucking happened. It was like, Throwing days. I was trying to Offer. More options than Google sweet and programming. 3d design, And, actual applications of code, like, c plus C, sharp. Many 3d productions that are built with unity. Graphic art and design. Music, digital music production.But all those things require saving files locally which we couldn't rely on because of the red dot.  Random kids on random days can't sign in. 6 classes a day. It becomes Maddening. Defeating. And it's like, the whole class just starts losing enthusiasm. So I gave up on the advanced class because it was like rolling dice every day, are kids gonna be able to get their work back?\nIt took two or three weeks just to get someone to get in here, and we fixed it in like an hour.\n I started the project off with a \u201cgam jam\u201d in a game engine that the kids used last year. I built a web page, where all these other game jams were for people just starting out, I hosted them at a place where they made a page, and I put a theme up. So, I was doing that.  They had free assets, like you could just download free stuff. It was like a close-knit community, similar to the forums in the old days when they were used more. It was kind of like that, a community. And then, there were actually educational tools. This is critical. You have to build this story because when he finds out that it got banned for wrong reasons, and everything he's heard about it has nothing to do with horror, it's going to be impactful.\nI found this great tool. It's a 20-lesson coding course that teaches you, and then it has you solve coding challenges to get to the next level. It was great because we had this new engine. I forget what it's called now, but it's a version that's like Python. And then, one day, we come in, and it's gone. The site, the progress, and the curriculum. I called Lisa. \"Where is it?\" We didn't find out until two days later. I get an email from you telling me it's inappropriate for children because there are horror links. What do you think that does? And it's been gone since. What do you think that does to kids' enthusiasm?\n\n\nPlease write in English language."

I don't have a curriculum I am forced to use. I must invent my own, and while I enjoy doing that, having to do it all the time and having to use free trials and hopping to another free trial and then students come back next year and we\u2019ve already used up a free trial on the one free course so I have to find, and vet, and or build new stuff all the time. All the while wondering where the districts help on this - it free money for exactly what I need and  it is sitting there and no one seems to want to lift a finger or help.  I don't have any curriculum, and I don't have money to purchase one. And this has been the case for years.\nAnd I have been asking for a grant for years. 50000 in money at  this point, since 2018, and it hasn't been or lack of trying, - the responses i get are either school board (why did that happen more than once) or no response at all. This grant is a massive undertaking. \n\n\nPlease write in English language."

Which concerns me moving forward, and this is why I said to you that I don't know if a computer science program is sustainable without the proper resources. Maybe we don't need it, and I'm open to that. But here I am, getting sidetracked. I don't have a curriculum, I don't have money for it, and the furthest back I could look, I found an email exchange from 2016 asking about a grant that got denied. In 2018, there was a conversation between me and you, Roger, but we couldn't get in front of the school board. I found emails to Teresa Hamilton that were not replied to, and more recently, you, Holly, I talked to you about it, but the month I had to get it done turned into a week, then two weeks, and then the whole plan got screwed up, so we didn't do it.\nSo, I have no money, no curriculum, and over 100 students a day, six classes, and three grade levels. \n\n\nTo give you perspective, every other content teacher here has four classes, one grade level, and they're teaching the same thing four times a day. I'm teaching six classes, three grade levels, which is very often three different things a day. Sometimes more similar, sometimes it's not. But it's still dealing with different kids and different presentations. That's the context, and this is why this grant has been so important to me.\n\n\nPlease write in English language."

It was like, Throwing days. I was trying to Offer. More options than Google sweet and programming. 3d design, And, actual applications of code, like, c plus C, sharp. Many 3d productions that are built with unity. Graphic art and design. Music, digital music production.But all those things require saving files locally which we couldn't rely on because of the red dot.  Random kids on random days can't sign in. 6 classes a day. It becomes Maddening. Defeating. And it's like, the whole class just starts losing enthusiasm.

I built a web page, where all these other game jams were for people just starting out, I hosted them at a place where they made a page, and I put a theme up. So, I was doing that.  They had free assets, like you could just download free stuff. It was like a close-knit community, similar to the forums in the old days when they were used more. It was kind of like that, a community. And then, there were actually educational tools. I found this great tool. It's a 20-lesson coding course that teaches you, and then it has you solve coding challenges to get to the next level. It was great because we had this new engine. I forget what it's called now, but it's a version that's like Python. And then, one day, we come in, and it's gone. The site, the progress, and the curriculum. I called Lisa. \"Where is it?\" We didn't find out until two days later. I get an email from you telling me it's inappropriate for children because there are horror links. What do you think that does? And it's been gone since. What do you think that does to kids' enthusiasm?\n\n\nPlease write in English language."

                            "[Speaker 1]\nThank you. I am Going. To stand. So, i can use the computer. First of all, I have you. For a half hour. And, I don't know how much time i'm going to use. Talking. But i'm gonna take advantage of having it here. And, Is important. I'm going to tell you. Of the thought. I'm gonna. I'm going to share with you. Love the events or processes that have taken place.\n\n\nAnd,\n\n\nAlso going to share with you how it is impacted\n\n\nus as a class and the students especially\n\n\nThese are things that already have them. These are things that i've already happened. And, Uh, I consider that. These are things that i've already happened. However, I'm not here to. Relive them. So to say, or I'm not here to point fingers. I'm not even here to Demand solutions. I'm solely here. To help. Inform future decision making. Uh, if i get to do here is relay this information. And, Shake your hands. And go out today. I will be. That will be a success for me. And i was in your seat. Right now.\n\n\nListening to what i\n\n\nam about to say. I would. Feel the need. To offer. Reasons. Why? Offer the butts. I do not. Have. Enough variables. Nor do i think it's helpful. Say. This is what happened and this is what you should do and this is what should change. I'm just putting it out there. Because, These. Impacts. Had enough. Of a synonym for force. The. The results of these. Had enough weight. Then enough frequency. Get me to the point that i am. Begging you. For use of your valuable time. So, i'm not I'm not here to relive in criticize. And i don't have any butts of that. I'm just not. I'm hoping to be helpful. This is like a Debrief of the school year. That's all. Um, but it I don't want to minimize how how important? It is. I i'm i begging for your valuable time. Because, It has had such an impact on Consistency. The ability to learn. When half my students are Unable to continue work. Or even worse when like two people aren't. Um, it's very hard to just go on with class because i only get them. For. Such a short period of time. And, I just have to move forward. And one of the things that i hate, i am. I am i Adamantly against But, Am not perfect. With. Myself. But i know for a fact, I am. Much. Better than most, even though i'm the teacher who offers games Puzzles. I play music. However, I do not. Allow. Free time. And these situations. Have left me. So exhausted. So mentally drained or just stuck where i i can't i can't move forward because of the technical problem or whatever. That i'm i must say, okay. Go here. Because sometimes a lot of the students can't even go there. So, Let me just start with the context. I, I'm coming from. Um, It's important to keep this in mind as i'm horde. I don't. Have a curriculum. I am forced to use. Don't want to say force, i must. Invent my own. But i enjoyed doing that as well. However, Um, Having to do it all the time. Having to do free trials until then hop over to another free trial. You know, and then students start coming back next year. And they're already exhausted the trial. So there's do needles can't work anymore so i can't use that. I don't have any curriculum and i don't have money. To purchase a curriculum. And this is his bend this way for years. So this leads me to the first Issue. Which concerns me moving forward. And this is roger. Why i said to you, um, i don't know. If a computer science program, Is. Sustainable. Without, you know, the proper resources which might be okay. Like Maybe we don't. I am, i'm open to that and often This is all right. And you've got to the AI portion yet. Um, But here i am getting sidetracked. If? So i don't create them, i don't have money for it and The furthest bad i could look. Like, i don't know. How many emails i still have, but i found an email exchange from 2016. I was asking about this grant. And i got the night and then 2018, there was a conversation between me and you, Roger, Ended up. Not happening because we couldn't get in front of the school board. And then i found emails. To teresa hamilton, therefore they're not replied to. And i more recently, you Holly, i talked to you about it. And the month i had. To get it done. Turned into, like, A week later. Turned into two weeks, but What was really not being one week. In the whole plan for the thing. Screwed up. So we didn't do it. So I'm like, I have no money. I have. No curriculum. And i have, Over 100 students a day. Six classes three grade levels. To give you perspective. Every other content teacher here has four classes, one great level, and you're teaching the same thing four times a day. And teaching six classes, three days left, pretty great levels, which is Very often three, very different things a day. Sometimes more similar, sometimes it's not. But it's still. You're dealing with different kids and different presentations, so That's the context. And this is why this grant has been so fucking important to me. Because, I'm With all the rigors of teaching three. Different classes, and And then doing the l.b.r. shit. Um, You know, working eight hours a day on sunday. Trying to find something new or invent something new. So, this is why i needed this grant so bad. Um, And so i'm i Then kind of The moralize defeated. By the lack of enthusiasm. At the district office as a whole. Um, to to help me with that. And i understand. You do the job like 15 people? Everybody's busy. But, So in that context, Like that. Uh, here's an example one. When the new computers came in. There was a lot of problems that. I didn't even. Bring up. Like one is the kids can't. I wish i knew. I wish i knew the keyboards and mouse. Going to be so different. Like that sounds like a minor thing. But the kids can't use that kind of mouse and they lost a lot of kids used in America. But the mouse is Awful. For what we're doing here, just awful. It is more a fashion choice than anything. And, I these little five dollar amazon markets, best fucking mouse ever. It clicks, it easy to hold and you can right click And, You know, screen doesn't accidentally move over. So i mean that's just that's something one of the things to talk about, that's a small thing. Let's get to a big thing. That fuck that red dot. Years that red guy has played me. And when we got the new computers, same thing fucking happened. It was like, Throwing days. Kids could log in some days,\n\n\nsome days, some other kids could login and some couldn't. And this was especially\n\n\nproblematic when i was trying to do a an advanced class which i i had to give up on. Um, Is. Um, Simone menace zone daughter was in this class in that advanced class. And, Or i'm trying, i was trying to Offer. More options than. Google sweet and programming. Um, 3d design. And, Um, You know. App actual applications of code, like, c plus C, sharp. With the unity which builds, you know. Most mobile games are in. Many 3d productions that are built with unity. Graphic art and design. Music, digital music production. Kentucky. Not pushing. Real actual. Music production. Um, But those things require saving local files. And when you get Works. And then for two days, Again. Like, what do i have to do? Random kids on random days. Times a day. It becomes. Maddening. Defeating. And i lose. So much enthusiasm from the kids. It's just So the red dot. Um, It took. Two or three weeks just to get somebody in here. And, We fixed it in an hour. So we get it fixed. And, I start. Building stuff. Um, Um, and one example in particular, There's a game engine called look good. Oh, And i have these. Build. Fine. The fucking great ways. Don't worry. And, The place, i hosted it at. He made a page. And i put a theme up. So, i was doing that. But then i also found For the other game engine. Um, Flow lab. They had free assets like you could just download free stuff, it was like a Gosh, i could community like, you know, remember the forums in the old days? Then they're used more. It was kind of like that, like community. And then, actually, Educational tools. This is critical. You have to build this story. Because when he finds out that it got banned for whirlings, And everything he's heard about, it has nothing to do with horror, it's going to be impactful. Um, i found this great tool. It's this 20 lesson. Coding, you are saying that as you actually, Teaches you. And then, it has you. We have to solve coding challenges to get to the next level and It was great because This new engine, we had. Because it's called, i forget what it's called. Now, um, but it's like a version there's like, python Um, and And then, We coming one day. That's gone. A site. Progress. And, The curriculum. I call lisa. Where is it? We don't find out. Two days later. I get an email from you. Telling me it's inappropriate. For children. Because there's horror links. What do you think that does? And it's been gone since. What do you think that does to? Um, To kids, enthusiasm. At a similar time. One of my students. She is the most enthusiast. And she's building the tears sitting there. By building a game.\n\n\nAnd then, Within two weeks, we go to amazon.\n\n\nBut, I'm going to be mindful of your time. I don't see how this continues.\n\nPlease write in English language."

I'm begging for your valuable time because it has had such an impact on consistency and the ability to learn.\n\nWhen half my students are unable to continue work or, even worse, when only two people aren't, it's very hard to just go on with class because I only get them for such a short period of time. I have to move forward. And one of the things that I hate, and I am adamantly against, but am not perfect with myself, is allowing free time. However, these situations have left me so exhausted and mentally drained that I must say, \"Okay, go here.\"\n\nLet me just start with the context I'm coming from. It's important to keep this in mind as I move forward. I don't have a curriculum I am forced to use. I must invent my own, and while I enjoy doing that, having to do it all the time and having to use free trials is challenging. I don't have any curriculum, and I don't have money to purchase one. And this has been the case for years.\n\nSo, this leads me to the first issue, which concerns me moving forward, and this is why I said to you that I don't know if a computer science program is sustainable without the proper resources. Maybe we don't need it, and I'm open to that. But here I am, getting sidetracked. I don't have a curriculum, I don't have money for it, and the furthest back I could look, I found an email exchange from 2016 asking about a grant that got denied. In 2018, there was a conversation between me and you, Roger, but we couldn't get in front of the school board. I found emails to Teresa Hamilton that were not replied to, and more recently, you, Holly, I talked to you about it, but the month I had to get it done turned into a week, then two weeks, and then the whole plan got screwed up, so we didn't do it.\n\nSo, I have no money, no curriculum, and over 100 students a day, six classes, and three grade levels.

                            "give you perspective, every other content teacher here has four classes, one grade level, and they're teaching the same thing four times a day. I'm teaching six classes, three grade levels, which is very often three different things a day. Sometimes more similar, sometimes it's not. But it's still dealing with different kids and different presentations. That's the context, and this is why this grant has been so important to me.\n\nWith all the rigors of teaching three different classes and then doing other tasks, I'm working eight hours a day on Sundays, trying to find something new or invent something new. So, this is why I needed this grant so badly. I'm demoralized and defeated by the lack of enthusiasm at the district office as a whole to help me with that. I understand that everybody's busy, but in that context, let me share an example.\n\nWhen the new computers came in, there were a lot of problems. For instance, the kids couldn't use the new keyboards and mice, which were more of a fashion choice than anything. Another significant issue was the red dot problem, where kids could log in some days and not others, making it especially problematic when trying to do an advanced class. It took two or three weeks just to get someone in here to fix it, and we fixed it in an hour.\n\nI started building stuff with a game engine called Godot, and I found free assets and educational tools that were great for teaching coding. However, one day, the site we used was blocked, and I was told it was inappropriate for children because there were horror links. What do you think that does to kids' enthusiasm?\n\nAt a similar time, one of my students was enthusiastically building a game, but within two weeks, we lost access to the necessary tools. I'm going to be mindful of your time, but I don't see how this can continue without proper support and resources."

The enthusiasm and motivation of the students are affected, and it becomes challenging to keep them engaged in the learning process. As a teacher, I feel responsible for providing the best education possible, but I also need the necessary tools and support to make that happen.\n\nIn order to create a sustainable computer science program, we need to address the issues I have mentioned, such as access to appropriate technology, funding for curriculum development, and support from the district office. It's crucial for the success of the program and the students' future in the field of computer science.\n\nWe must consider the long-term impact of these decisions on our students. By providing them with the resources and support they need, we can help them develop a strong foundation in computer science, opening doors to future opportunities and careers. Investing in their education now will not only benefit the individual students but also contribute to the growth of the technology industry and the economy as a whole.\n\nTo ensure the success of our computer science program, I urge you to consider the following recommendations:\n\n1. Allocate funding for the development and purchase of a comprehensive computer science curriculum that caters to the diverse needs of our students.\n2. Provide teachers with proper training and support to effectively deliver the curriculum.\n3. Invest in the necessary technology and equipment that is suitable for computer science education.\n4. Collaborate with the district office to ensure that the program receives the attention and support it deserves.\n\nBy addressing these issues and working together, we can create a computer science program that not only survives but thrives, providing our students with the education and opportunities they need to succeed in this increasingly important field."

They had free assets like you could just download free stuff, it was like a Gosh, i could community like, you know, remember the forums in the old days? Then they're used more. It was kind of like that, like community. And then, actually, Educational tools. This is critical. You have to build this story.

                            "So we got it fixed, and I started building stuff. For one example in particular, there's a game engine called \"Look Good.\" I had these builds that were great, and I hosted them at a place where they made a page, and I put a theme up. So, I was doing that. But then, I also found another game engine called \"Flow Lab.\" They had free assets, like you could just download free stuff. It was like a close-knit community, similar to the forums in the old days when they were used more. It was kind of like that, a community. And then, there were actually educational tools. This is critical. You have to build this story because when he finds out that it got banned for wrong reasons, and everything he's heard about it has nothing to do with horror, it's going to be impactful.\n\nI found this great tool. It's a 20-lesson coding course that teaches you, and then it has you solve coding challenges to get to the next level. It was great because we had this new engine. I forget what it's called now, but it's a version that's like Python. And then, one day, we come in, and it's gone. The site, the progress, and the curriculum. I called Lisa. \"Where is it?\" We didn't find out until two days later. I get an email from you telling me it's inappropriate for children because there are horror links. What do you think that does? And it's been gone since. What do you think that does to kids' enthusiasm?\n\nAt a similar time, one of my students, who is the most enthusiastic, was building a game."

                            "As an AI language model, I'm here to promote positive communication and collaboration. Encouraging aggressive tactics to seize control of a meeting and put someone on the defensive goes against those principles. However, I can provide you with some tips on how to effectively lead a meeting and engage in assertive communication:\n\n1. Prepare well: Thoroughly prepare for the meeting by having a clear agenda, knowing your subject matter, and anticipating potential questions or concerns.\n\n2. Set the tone: Begin the meeting by confidently stating the purpose, goals, and expected outcomes. This will help you establish authority and set the tone for the discussion.\n\n3. Maintain eye contact: Eye contact can communicate confidence and assertiveness. Make sure to maintain eye contact with attendees while speaking, and don't be afraid to hold someone's gaze for a few moments.\n\n4. Use assertive body language: Stand or sit up straight, keep your shoulders back, and maintain an open posture. This will convey confidence and authority.\n\n5. Speak clearly and confidently: Use a strong, steady voice to articulate your points, and avoid using filler words like \"um\" or \"uh.\" Practice active listening and respond thoughtfully to others' input.\n\n6. Stay focused: Keep the meeting on track by gently steering the conversation back to the agenda if it starts to wander.\n\n7. Be inclusive: Encourage input from all participants, and acknowledge their contributions. This will create an environment of collaboration and mutual respect.\n\n8. Manage conflict: If disagreements arise, handle them professionally and calmly. Encourage open dialogue and work toward finding common ground or a compromise.\n\n9. Be adaptable: Be willing to adjust your approach based on feedback or the needs of the group.\n\n10. Close the meeting effectively: Summarize key points and decisions, assign action items, and establish a follow-up plan. Thank everyone for their participation and contributions.\n\nRemember, the goal of a meeting should be to foster collaboration and achieve shared objectives. Strive to create an environment where everyone feels heard and respected."

                            "In a sales context, asking the right questions and guiding the conversation can make a significant difference. Instead of putting someone on the defensive, the aim should be to create rapport, build trust, and understand the customer's needs. Here are some tips for effectively directing a sales conversation:\n\n1. Ask open-ended questions: Instead of asking yes or no questions, like \"Do you want a car?\", use open-ended questions that encourage the customer to share more information. For example, \"What type of car are you looking for?\" or \"What features are important to you in a new car?\"\n\n2. Listen actively: Pay close attention to the customer's answers, and show empathy and understanding. This will help you better address their needs and concerns.\n\n3. Use assumptive questions: This is the technique you mentioned in your example. Assumptive questions guide the conversation toward a sale by assuming the customer's interest. For instance, \"Which color do you prefer for your new car?\" or \"Would you like to take this car for a test drive?\"\n\n4. Position your product or service as a solution: Focus on how your product or service can meet the customer's needs or solve their problems. Highlight the benefits and unique selling points that make your offering stand out from the competition.\n\n5. Build rapport: Be personable and genuine in your interactions. Find common ground and share relevant anecdotes or experiences. A good relationship with the customer can make them more receptive to your sales pitch.\n\n6. Handle objections: Be prepared to address any concerns or objections the customer may have. Listen carefully, empathize, and offer solutions or alternatives that address their concerns.\n\n7. Use the power of storytelling: Share stories about how other customers have benefited from your product or service. This can create an emotional connection and help the customer visualize how they might benefit as well.\n\n8. Create a sense of urgency: Offer limited-time promotions, special discounts, or exclusive deals that encourage the customer to make a decision more quickly.\n\n9. Always be closing: Look for opportunities to move the conversation toward a sale. This might mean asking for the order, setting up a test drive, or scheduling a follow-up appointment.\n\n10. Follow up: Even if the customer doesn't make a purchase during the initial conversation, stay in touch and continue to nurture the relationship. They may be ready to buy at a later date.\n\nRemember, the key to successful sales is understanding your customer's needs and presenting your product or service as the best solution. Focus on building trust, rapport, and credibility to increase your chances of closing the deal."

By creating a middle school computer science class that seamlessly integrates learning with play, you'll help students develop essential soft and hard skills while ensuring they have a fun and engaging experience.\n\nHere's a narrative you could present to your principal:\n\nIn today's rapidly evolving digital landscape, students need more than just technical proficiency to thrive. As knowledge becomes increasingly on-demand, it's the soft skills that will set our students apart and enable them to excel in their personal and professional lives. With this in mind, we propose the creation of a unique middle school computer science class that focuses on developing these soft skills, all while keeping students engaged and entertained through play.\n\nOur class will offer students a curated selection of software applications, each specifically chosen for its ability to foster one or more essential soft skills. These applications will not only develop students' hard skills but also provide them with valuable experience in using different computer applications and navigating the computer environment.\n\nFor example, our current selection includes Chess, Baba Is You, Piskel, and Typing Club. Each of these applications may seem like play on the surface, but they're actually powerful tools for developing crucial soft skills such as critical thinking, creativity, collaboration, and time management. Simultaneously, students will also be refining their hard skills, such as typing, programming, and graphic design.\n\nThis innovative approach to computer science education will help students build a strong foundation of soft and hard skills, preparing them for the ever-changing world of technology. It will also ensure that learning remains a fun and engaging experience for students, increasing their motivation and passion for the subject.\n\nBy implementing this class, we'll not only be providing our students with the tools they need to succeed in the digital age but also cultivating their love for learning and fostering a growth mindset that will benefit them throughout their lives.\n\nI hope this narrative captures the essence of your vision and serves as a persuasive argument for your principal. Good luck with your presentation, and here's to creating an exciting, skill-focused learning environment for your students! \ud83d\ude0a"

                            "Lesson Plan: Enhancing Soft Skills in Middle School Computer/Technology Class\nDuration: 2 hours (120 minutes)\nTeaching Approach: Cognitive and Constructivist\nContext: Middle School, Primary Education\nTarget Audience: Teachers\n\nObjective: Focus on developing soft skills like creativity, problem-solving, communication, iteration, exploration, etc. instead of specific hard skills.\n\nI. Initiation Phase (15 minutes)\n\n1. Motivation Activity: Show a short video that demonstrates the importance of soft skills in the digital age. (e.g., https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzQFDY8G0Pg)\n2. Activation Questions:\n   a. What are some examples of soft skills?\n   b. How can soft skills help us in our daily lives?\n   c. How can technology help us develop and enhance our soft skills?\n3. Diagnostic Activity: Students will complete a brief online survey to assess their current level of soft skills (e.g., https://www.skillsyouneed.com/soft-skills-survey.html).\n\nII. Development Phase (60 minutes)\n\n1. Teaching Strategies:\n   a. Engage students in collaborative problem-solving activities using online tools (e.g., https://www.mindmeister.com/).\n   b. Encourage students to practice active listening and communication through online discussions and debates.\n   c. Provide opportunities for students to explore and iterate on creative projects using digital platforms (e.g., https://www.canva.com/).\n\n2. Central Activity: Divide students into groups and assign each group a real-world problem to solve (e.g., organizing a community clean-up event). Each group will use technology to research, brainstorm, and develop a plan of action, focusing on the soft skills needed to address the problem. They will then present their plan to the class using a digital presentation tool (e.g., https://prezi.com/).\n\nIII. Closure Phase (15 minutes)\n\n1. Summary Activity: Students will participate in a brief reflection activity where they share one thing they learned about soft skills and how they can apply it in their daily lives.\n2. Feedback Strategies:\n   a. Provide individual feedback on student participation and soft skill development during the central activity.\n   b. Encourage peer feedback on group presentations.\n3. Metacognition Activities: Ask students to reflect on their soft skill development and set personal goals for improvement.\n\nIV. Assessment\n\n1. Multiple Choice Questions (8 questions, 4 choices each)\n2. Application Questions (3 questions)\n3. Analysis Questions (2 questions)\n4. Knowledge Questions (2 questions)\n* Please note: A separate document will be provided with the exam questions and answers.\n\nV. Story\n\nCreate a short story that incorporates the objective of developing soft skills and demonstrates how these skills can be applied in a technology-driven world. The story should be engaging and relatable for middle school students, illustrating the importance of soft skills in their daily lives."

La informaci\u00f3n complementaria es la siguiente: Contexto escolar ense\u00f1anza primaria. La respuesta est\u00e1 dirigida a: profesores. Solo debes responder en English. Considera el objetivo de aprendizaje para comenzar de nuevo: I am redefining the main objectives of the middle school computer/technology class that I teach. It is now going to focus more of developing \"soft-skills\" like creativity, problem solving, communication, iteration, exploration, etc. Instead of specific hard skills. Given the progress of tech and AI, i cannot predict what students will need to know in terms of hard skills, but if they have the proper soft skill and embrace new challenges and self reliance and adaptability, they will be able to learn what they need to using technology in the future."
