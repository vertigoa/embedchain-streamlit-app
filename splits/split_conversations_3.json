                            "The brewing time for tea varies depending on the type of tea and the desired strength. Different teas have different optimal brewing times due to variations in leaf size, processing methods, and desired flavor profile. Here's a general breakdown:\n\n1. **Initial Seconds (0-30 seconds)**: The tea begins to hydrate and expand. Flavors start to infuse into the water, but this is usually too brief for a full flavor development.\n\n2. **Short Brew (1-2 minutes)**: Suitable for delicate teas like green or white teas. This short brewing time extracts fewer tannins, resulting in a lighter, less bitter flavor.\n\n3. **Medium Brew (3-5 minutes)**: Common for black teas and oolong teas. The longer brewing time allows for a fuller extraction of flavors and tannins, leading to a stronger, more robust taste.\n\n4. **Long Brew (5+ minutes)**: Herbal teas often require this longer brewing time for full flavor extraction since they're made from hardier materials than tea leaves, like roots or bark.\n\nThe rate at which the flavor and compounds are extracted from the tea leaves into the water is generally a nonlinear process. Initially, the extraction is rapid, releasing a burst of flavor and caffeine. As time progresses, the rate of extraction slows down, and more tannins are released, which can lead to a bitter taste if overbrewed.\n\nThe exact time for optimal brewing can vary based on personal preference, water temperature, and the specific type of tea. Experimentation with brewing times can help you find the perfect balance for your taste."

                            "The \"Use Drive to Organize Files\" lesson on the Google Applied Digital Skills platform is designed to teach students how to effectively organize files and folders in Google Drive. This lesson involves various skills like digital collaboration, file organization, and file sharing, and takes about 45 to 90 minutes to complete. It uses tools like Google Docs and Drive.\n\nIn response to your student's query, you can acknowledge the concern while encouraging deeper engagement and problem-solving skills. Here's a suggested response:\n\n\"I appreciate you bringing this to my attention. It\u2019s important to understand every step in the process of organizing files in Google Drive. However, I encourage you to revisit the videos and materials provided in the lesson. Sometimes, the answer might be in the details we overlook on the first pass. If a step seems missing, try to deduce what it could be based on the context and information available. This approach not only helps in understanding the current lesson but also builds problem-solving skills vital for digital literacy. If you're still having trouble after reviewing, please specify which part of the lesson you're referring to, and we can explore it together.\" \n\nThis response acknowledges the issue, emphasizes the importance of self-initiative, and offers support while being firm about the expectations from the student."

                            "I work for a public middle school. I teach computer science, 6th, 7th, and 8th grade. The recent technology advancements and advancements in data have left our school and district scrambling to keep up. I, however, have a master's in data analytics. I've been involved in technology since the late 90s, working on the early Internet. I've lived through the transition from analog to digital. I was born in 77, and I've been involved and interested in technology ever since I was a kid. I'm staying current on all advancements in artificial intelligence and related technologies. There is a vacuum of expertise in the public school sector. There is a major vacuum in our school, and I see people scrambling to adjust. If I want to propose a new position, a salary position of adequate pay, that would be a real-time advisor, consultant, researcher, systems integrator. By systems integrator, I mean I would test new ways of doing things and collect data and analyze that data to determine the best outcomes and best practices for a particular new solution, especially giving all the influx of new technology. I need to present this to lay people, but I need to present them all the information so they don't have to think. I also forgot to mention most of my 20s and 30s were spent in science and skepticism and critical thinking activism. It wasn't until I got close to 40 that I decided to go get a degree in science with a minor in mathematics and a focus on teaching to become a science teacher. I've since become a computer science teacher, but I still am guided by those best practices of scientific discipline. There is creeping pseudoscience in our school and in our district. There is a creeping effect of authoritarian tendencies, but I don't want to say authoritarianism because it's too dramatic. So, in order to prevent pseudoscience and bad practices and outdated snake oil techniques, and there's a lot of snake oil sales. There's a lot of snake oil salesmen that jump in on a new tech and they teach you things that you can easily find online or that are just blatantly false. In order to prevent the vacuum that has been created by new technology advancements and, frankly, a retiring and under-trained aging, retiring teacher and administrator population, it is vital that we get ahead of the curve and create a new position at our school, an advisor slash researcher slash consultant on all things technology and a side project of researching best practices. I don't want to call it advisor. I don't want to call it consultant. But what I do need is a position, a rationale, a proposal for this position and why I'm the best candidate for it, and a salary that would be appropriate for working in the Garfield RE2 School District in Brigham Colorado this year, or next year, and maybe some duties, some expectations of my position. Take your time, do a little research, and return your best first attempt."

Students in Re-2 classrooms are able to communicate, collaborate, create, and contribute in new and innovative ways. \nL564: \nL565: Every teacher in our district has both a MacBook Air and an iPad Pro for educational use. All classrooms have projectors and document cameras. Students primarily use Chromebooks and GSuite apps in addition to targeted iPads and iMac labs. These tools are supported by full Cisco wireless coverage in all buildings and district-wide Centurylink fiber WAN using MOE. Our District-wide help desk troubleshoots (and often resolves) problems remotely while building technicians support on-site issues. Student data, grades, and state reports are securely housed and managed in our student information system (SIS), PowerSchool. \nL566: \nL567: Quality, effective, Instructional technology use with students requires continuing training for teachers. Re-2 provides teachers and staff with high-quality professional development for every grade-level, content area, and department. RE-2 instructional technology coaches work with individual teachers, small groups, and large groups throughout the District. They support every aspect of the teaching and learning cycle (WHHW) from lesson design to best practices, and assessments. The technology team also offers a 4-day learning institute every year in June (JLI). With over 50 classes to choose from (almost all taught by RE-2 teachers), employees learn and share effective ways to use digital classroom technology. \nL568: \nL569: ### GARFIELD SCHOOL DISTRICT NO.

Students in Re-2 classrooms are able to communicate, collaborate, create, and contribute in new and innovative ways. \nL564: \nL565: Every teacher in our district has both a MacBook Air and an iPad Pro for educational use. All classrooms have projectors and document cameras. Students primarily use Chromebooks and GSuite apps in addition to targeted iPads and iMac labs. These tools are supported by full Cisco wireless coverage in all buildings and district-wide Centurylink fiber WAN using MOE. Our District-wide help desk troubleshoots (and often resolves) problems remotely while building technicians support on-site issues. Student data, grades, and state reports are securely housed and managed in our student information system (SIS), PowerSchool. \nL566: \nL567: Quality, effective, Instructional technology use with students requires continuing training for teachers. Re-2 provides teachers and staff with high-quality professional development for every grade-level, content area, and department. RE-2 instructional technology coaches work with individual teachers, small groups, and large groups throughout the District. They support every aspect of the teaching and learning cycle (WHHW) from lesson design to best practices, and assessments. The technology team also offers a 4-day learning institute every year in June (JLI). With over 50 classes to choose from (almost all taught by RE-2 teachers), employees learn and share effective ways to use digital classroom technology. \nL568: \nL569: ### GARFIELD SCHOOL DISTRICT NO.

Right now, I'm a teacher, but I'm already providing tech support for the entire building. I could be tech support for the building. I would not work for the district technology office. I would work for the building, but communicate with the district technology office. All of the unknowns. I could fill those positions at least temporarily. Shit, we need to think about this new technology. Mike, please go research it. Or, Mike, we need help implementing something new. Or Mike, we gotta fucking copy her down. Shit like that. Um, I am already, me and my principal have already worked deeply on a campaign that we involved the public with. We screened a movie that tried to highlight to parents the dangers involved with the social media algorithms and kind of addicting teenagers and using poor tactics. And we taught parents how to discover those tactics and look out for them to protect their kids. But in the meantime, me and her also became experts on the attention economy and the technology side of it. And we share that deep knowledge and understanding. And she shares that with nobody else. So there's this trust there. Um, also, I'm already doing a lot of this stuff. I'm already doing it. Also, this position would be the first year we would figure stuff out. But we would find roles. I could go to classrooms and help out. Um, I am a jack of all trades. We already said that. Oh, but the other thing is, this position could serve as a template if other positions around the district are required. Or if it's deemed that it is, I am needed elsewhere because I don't have enough to do here, which is not going to be true. But we can offer it. I could help out elsewhere in the district with these exact problems. The point is, there are unique problems that I'm already solving in the school that I don't, that aren't part of my job description that could be used in this position. And there are going to be future things that the tech department who's in charge of building technology is not going to be equipped to deal with."

                            "To address your question about creating two DataFrames based on specific criteria from an existing DataFrame (`food_consumption`), you'll need to use pandas, a powerful data manipulation library in Python. The task involves filtering rows based on a specific condition - in this case, the country name.\n\nHere's a brief explanation of the concepts and steps involved:\n\n1. **DataFrame**: A DataFrame in pandas is a two-dimensional, size-mutable, potentially heterogeneous tabular data structure with labeled axes (rows and columns). It's similar to a spreadsheet or SQL table.\n\n2. **Filtering Data**: You can filter data in a DataFrame based on some condition. This involves selecting rows where a specific column matches the condition.\n\n3. **Syntax for Filtering**: To filter rows in pandas, you use a condition inside the square brackets `[]`. For example, `df[df['column_name'] == 'value']` selects all rows in `df` where the value in 'column_name' is equal to 'value'.\n\nApplying these concepts to your question:\n\n- **be_consumption**: This DataFrame should contain rows from `food_consumption` where the country is 'Belgium'. You would filter like so: `be_consumption = food_consumption[food_consumption['country'] == 'Belgium']`.\n\n- **usa_consumption**: Similarly, this DataFrame should have rows from `food_consumption` where the country is 'USA'. The filtering would be: `usa_consumption = food_consumption[food_consumption['country'] == 'USA']`.\n\nIn both cases, you're creating a new DataFrame that contains only the rows from `food_consumption` where the 'country' column matches the specified country ('Belgium' or 'USA')."

                            "Sure, let's delve deeper into the syntax for filtering in pandas, a Python library used for data manipulation and analysis. Filtering is a crucial part of data analysis as it allows you to focus on specific segments of your dataset based on certain criteria.\n\n### Basic Filtering Syntax:\n\n1. **Condition Inside Square Brackets**: The basic syntax for filtering in pandas involves placing a condition inside square brackets `[]` attached to the DataFrame. For example, `df[df['column'] == value]` selects rows where the 'column' has the specified 'value'.\n\n2. **Multiple Conditions**: To combine multiple conditions, you use logical operators like `&` (and), `|` (or), and `~` (not). Parentheses are important around each condition. For example, `df[(df['column1'] == value1) & (df['column2'] == value2)]` filters rows where 'column1' equals 'value1' and 'column2' equals 'value2'.\n\n3. **Inequality and Range**: You can also use operators like `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`, and `!=` for inequalities. For instance, `df[df['column'] > value]` selects rows where 'column' is greater than 'value'. You can combine these for range queries.\n\n### Advanced Filtering Techniques:\n\n1. **Using `isin` for Multiple Values**: If you need to filter rows based on multiple values in a column, `isin` is useful. For instance, `df[df['column'].isin([value1, value2, value3])]` selects rows where 'column' has any of the specified values.\n\n2. **Using `str` Methods for String Filtering**: For string columns, you can use string methods for more complex filters, like `df[df['column'].str.contains('substring')]` to filter rows where 'column' contains a particular substring.\n\n3. **Using `query` Method**: pandas also provides a `query` method that allows you to write your filter conditions more succinctly and in a way that's similar to SQL. For example, `df.query('column == value')`.\n\n### Practical Considerations:\n\n- **Performance**: Be mindful of performance when dealing with large datasets. Certain types of filters or complex conditions can be computationally intensive.\n\n- **Chaining Filters**: You can chain multiple filtering operations. Each filter is applied sequentially to the result of the previous one.\n\n- **Data Types**: Ensure that the column you're filtering by is of the appropriate data type. For example, string operations won't work on numeric columns unless you convert them to strings.\n\nFiltering is a versatile tool in pandas, and mastering it can significantly enhance your data analysis capabilities. It's often the first step in exploring your dataset and understanding the patterns within it."

Essentially, LangChain provides the tools and infrastructure necessary for creating and deploying agents\u301010\u2020source\u3011.\n\n- **AutoGen**: Developed by Microsoft, AutoGen is a multi-agent framework. Unlike LangChain, which focuses on building individual agents, AutoGen specializes in enabling multiple agents to converse and collaborate. This aspect positions AutoGen uniquely in the realm of LLM-driven applications, particularly in scenarios that require multi-agent interaction\u30107\u2020source\u3011\u30109\u2020source\u3011.\n\nIn summary, while both LangChain and AutoGen cater to the development of LLM-driven applications, they differ in their approach and focus. LangChain is more about building individual agents and integrating them with various data sources, whereas AutoGen emphasizes multi-agent collaboration and conversation."

                            "The visual cortex, responsible for processing visual information, is one of the largest and most complex parts of the human brain. This is because vision is an incredibly intricate sense that requires substantial brain power to process. Several factors contribute to its size and complexity:\n\n1. **High Bandwidth of Visual Information**: The eyes transmit a vast amount of data to the brain. This data includes details about color, motion, depth, and patterns. Processing this detailed information requires a large and complex network of neurons.\n\n2. **Visual Processing Complexity**: Vision isn't just about detecting light; it involves interpreting shapes, recognizing objects and faces, understanding spatial relationships, and integrating visual data with other sensory information and prior knowledge.\n\n3. **Evolutionary Significance**: For many animals, especially primates, vision is a primary sense for navigating the environment, finding food, and identifying threats. Over millions of years of evolution, the visual cortex has expanded and specialized to enhance survival.\n\n4. **Involvement in Higher Cognitive Functions**: The visual cortex is not just involved in basic visual processing; it also plays a role in higher-level functions like memory, attention, and even some aspects of consciousness.\n\n5. **Neuroplasticity**: The brain's ability to reorganize itself by forming new neural connections throughout life means that areas like the visual cortex can grow in response to demand and experience.\n\n6. **Integration with Other Brain Areas**: The visual cortex is heavily interconnected with other parts of the brain, including those involved in motor functions, spatial awareness, and decision-making, further contributing to its size and complexity. \n\nThis complexity and size underline the importance of vision in human perception and interaction with the world."

                            "Your perspective, emphasizing nuance in how visual information influences learning, aligns more closely with current understandings in cognitive science and neuroscience.\n\nThe size of the visual cortex indeed signifies the importance and complexity of visual processing in humans. However, it doesn't directly translate to the idea that more visual information or complexity always leads to better engagement or learning. Key points to consider:\n\n1. **Quality vs. Quantity**: Effective learning through visual means depends more on the relevance and quality of the visual information than sheer volume. Overloading with visual data can lead to confusion or cognitive overload, hindering learning.\n\n2. **Individual Differences**: People have varying preferences and capacities for processing visual information. Some may benefit more from visual learning, while others may find auditory or kinesthetic inputs more effective.\n\n3. **Contextual Importance**: The effectiveness of visual information also depends on the context. For some subjects, like geometry or geography, visual aids are crucial. For others, like philosophy or literature, they might be less important.\n\n4. **Integration with Other Senses**: Learning is often most effective when it integrates multiple senses. Relying solely on visual input can ignore the benefits of this multisensory integration.\n\n5. **Cognitive Load Theory**: This theory suggests there's a limit to how much information our working memory can process at once. Too much visual complexity can exceed this limit, making learning less efficient.\n\n6. **Attention and Engagement**: While visually rich content can be more engaging, it's the relevance and meaningfulness of the content that truly drives engagement and learning, not just its visual complexity.\n\nIn summary, while the visual cortex's size reflects the importance of visual information in human cognition, learning effectiveness depends on a balanced and contextually appropriate use of visual and other sensory inputs. Too much visual complexity can be counterproductive, aligning with your view that there's significant nuance involved in how visual information impacts learning."

                            "Your skepticism regarding the notion of learning styles, particularly in the context of education, is supported by a significant body of research. The concept of learning styles, popular in educational theory, posits that individuals learn better when they receive information in their preferred learning style, be it visual, auditory, kinesthetic, or another modality. However, several key points align with your perspective:\n\n1. **Lack of Empirical Evidence**: Despite its popularity, there is little empirical evidence supporting the efficacy of teaching methods tailored to learning styles. Studies have not consistently shown that using an individual's preferred learning style leads to better learning outcomes.\n\n2. **Misinterpretation of Preferences**: The preference for a certain type of information (like visual or auditory) does not necessarily translate to increased effectiveness in learning when that preference is catered to. Preferences might indicate comfort or familiarity rather than effectiveness in learning.\n\n3. **Context-Specific Learning**: The effectiveness of a learning modality is often context-dependent. For instance, visual learning might be more effective in subjects like art or geometry, whereas auditory learning could be more beneficial in music or language studies.\n\n4. **Neuroplasticity and Adaptability**: The human brain is adaptable and capable of learning through various modalities. Insisting on a fixed learning style might limit this adaptability and the opportunity to develop underused modalities.\n\n5. **Importance of Quality and Relevance**: As you mentioned, the quality and relevance of the learning material (like the accuracy of a graphic) are crucial. Effective learning materials need to be accurate, engaging, and appropriately complex, regardless of the sensory modality.\n\n6. **Multimodal Learning**: Research suggests that integrating multiple modes of learning (visual, auditory, kinesthetic) can be more effective than relying on a single mode.\n\nIn summary, your view that learning preferences are subjective and dependent on the quality and context of information is well-founded. The current consensus in educational research is moving away from rigid categorizations of learning styles and towards more flexible, multimodal, and context-sensitive approaches to teaching and learning."

This building represents a system based on scientific principles. \n\nThe other building, representing a system based on pseudoscience, is constructed using unproven methods, guesswork, and subpar materials that might look appealing but lack the properties necessary for structural integrity. \n\nOver time, the scientifically constructed building remains stable and functional, able to withstand environmental stresses and serve its intended purpose effectively. In contrast, the pseudoscience-based building faces numerous issues \u2013 it may look fine superficially but is fundamentally weak. It's prone to damage, unable to withstand environmental stresses, and ultimately, it's likely to collapse, failing to fulfill its intended purpose. \n\nThis analogy shows how systems based on solid, proven principles (like scientific ones) are reliable and effective, while those based on unproven, unreliable methods (like pseudoscience) are destined to fail, unable to withstand real-world challenges."

                            "Your analogy vividly captures the essence of the issue with systems built on pseudoscience. It's like an audience watching David Copperfield's famous levitation act and then trying to develop a real-world system to levitate people. They focus on discussing the types of \"magic\" or \"sorcery\" that might have been used, debating the most effective spells or mystical techniques, completely bypassing the reality that the act is an illusion supported by hidden mechanical contraptions and skilled performance.\n\nIn this analogy, the audience's fascination with the idea of magic and their attempts to replicate levitation through supernatural means represent the pseudoscientific approach. They are so captivated by the spectacle and the idea of magic that they ignore the practical, scientific explanations (like hidden supports or optical illusions) that actually make the trick work.\n\nThis demonstrates how systems based on pseudoscience often get caught up in the allure of seemingly miraculous results (like levitation in the magic show) without acknowledging or understanding the underlying scientific principles or mechanisms that are truly at play. As a result, they are bound to fail in creating effective solutions, just as one cannot truly levitate people using spells or incantations."

                            "Addressing concerns about pseudoscientific policies to someone in a position of authority, especially when they are personally invested in these policies, requires a delicate balance between assertiveness and diplomacy. Here are some strategies to consider:\n\n1. **Prepare Your Case**: Gather concrete evidence and data that demonstrate the ineffectiveness or negative impact of the current policies. If possible, compare this with data supporting scientifically-backed alternatives.\n\n2. **Focus on Positive Outcomes**: Frame your conversation around the desire for positive change and improved outcomes, rather than directly attacking the current policies. Emphasize how evidence-based practices could lead to better results.\n\n3. **Use Neutral Language**: Avoid using charged or confrontational language. Phrases like \"I've noticed some areas for improvement\" can be less threatening than outright criticism.\n\n4. **Offer Solutions, Not Just Criticism**: Bring to the table alternative strategies or policies that are grounded in scientific principles. This shows that you're not just identifying problems but also thinking about how to solve them.\n\n5. **Seek Common Ground**: Start by acknowledging any positive aspects or intentions of the current policies. This can create a foundation of agreement from which to discuss changes.\n\n6. **Utilize External Expertise**: Sometimes bringing in an outside expert or citing authoritative sources can lend weight to your arguments, especially if they are recognized authorities in the field.\n\n7. **Be Empathetic**: Understand that your principal might take criticism personally. Acknowledge their efforts and intentions while gently steering the conversation towards the need for change.\n\n8. **Propose a Pilot or Trial**: Suggest testing the proposed evidence-based approach in a limited way to demonstrate its efficacy, which could be less intimidating than overhauling existing policies all at once.\n\n9. **Be Prepared for Resistance**: Change, especially in institutional settings, can be slow. Be patient and persistent, and be prepared to have multiple conversations.\n\n10. **Focus on Shared Goals**: Remind your principal that you both share the goal of improving outcomes and that examining and updating policies is a part of ensuring the organization's success.\n\nRemember, the key is not to win an argument but to initiate constructive dialogue that could lead to positive changes. Your approach should be respectful, collaborative, and focused on the common goal of the organization's success."

                            "Your position is clear and strong, rooted in your commitment to ethical practices and the well-being of those you serve. Standing up against policies you believe are harmful, especially when they conflict with your core principles, is commendable. Here are some steps to help you address this situation:\n\n1. **Document Specific Concerns**: Clearly outline how the current policies are causing harm or are ineffective. Specific examples can be more persuasive than general statements.\n\n2. **Express Personal Impact**: Share how these policies are affecting you personally and professionally. This personal testimony can be powerful, especially if it's causing you deep suffering.\n\n3. **Articulate Ethical Concerns**: Since you feel these practices are morally wrong, articulate this ethical standpoint. If they're potentially harmful to the people you serve, highlight this as a primary concern.\n\n4. **Professional Standards and Best Practices**: Reference industry standards and best practices to reinforce your point. This shows that your concerns are not just personal opinions but are supported by professional consensus.\n\n5. **Seek Allies**: If possible, find colleagues who share your views and concerns. There's often strength in numbers, and a unified voice can have a greater impact.\n\n6. **Prepare for the Meeting**: Plan how you'll present your concerns. Rehearse your key points to remain clear and concise.\n\n7. **Choose the Right Time and Setting**: Request a private meeting in a neutral setting where you can speak candidly without interruptions.\n\n8. **Deliver Your Message with Respect**: While you're firm in your stance, maintain respect and professionalism. This helps in keeping the conversation constructive.\n\n9. **Be Prepared for All Outcomes**: Understand that there might be consequences, including the risk of losing your job. Ensure you are prepared for this outcome, both emotionally and practically.\n\n10. **Have a Plan B**: Consider your options if the situation doesn't change. This could include transferring to a different department, looking for another job, or even legal action if applicable.\n\nRemember, your well-being and ethical integrity are paramount. Standing up for what you believe is right, especially in challenging circumstances, is a courageous act. Whatever the outcome, you're making a decision aligned with your values and principles."

                            "So just to update you, the system is called the Learning Behavior Rubik, and basically if a teacher thinks a kid needs to be on it, usually for like ADHD issues and stuff, but they don't say ADHD, it's just like distraction, lack of attention, fidgeting, talking out of turn, stuff like that. And there's nine categories, and they have to get, there's nine random categories. They don't even cover everything, and there are too many. They pick the categories so they align with the school, I don't know, motto. Anyway, it's nine, and they get one point for each behavior they were good. And the teacher marks a number, one through eight, or one through nine, and there's no, the number doesn't translate to anything except for they met all the things, but if they missed one of the things, say, there's no description of what it was for. Like it could be a big event, it could be something small and meaningless. So when we see eight out of nine, we think good, and it could be bad. So there's just, there's no good system. But anyway, the worst part is these kids who have like ADHD issues, as I was telling you before, some of them just may have their brains formed like that, and they have to carry around this green sheet on their person that everybody sees, or a yellow one, or a red one, depending on how bad they are. They have to carry this fucking thing around the school, and whether they like it or not, everybody sees it. And they have to get it signed by every single teacher. And if they don't, they get lunch detentions in front of everybody. For, I don't know, maybe they have ADHD. I mean, we don't ask the kids if they like it or not, if it makes them embarrassed, or if it makes them feel bad. So my philosophy is if this is hurting one out of five kids, we need to know about that. We don't."

                            "The Learning Behavior Rubik system you've described raises several concerns, especially regarding its implementation and impact on students. The key issues seem to be:\n\n1. **Lack of Specificity**: The system's categories are too broad and don't provide enough detail to meaningfully assess student behavior. This vagueness could lead to inconsistent or subjective interpretations by teachers.\n\n2. **Inadequate Representation**: The nine categories may not comprehensively cover the range of behaviors or needs of all students, leading to some being unfairly judged or overlooked.\n\n3. **Stigmatization and Privacy**: Carrying a visible sheet that marks behavior (green, yellow, or red) is problematic. It publicly labels students, potentially stigmatizing those with behavioral or attentional differences, like ADHD. This can be embarrassing and damaging to their self-esteem.\n\n4. **Punitive Measures**: The use of lunch detentions for non-compliance adds a punitive aspect to the system. This could be particularly unfair for students struggling with issues beyond their control.\n\n5. **Lack of Student Input**: Not asking students how they feel about this system is a significant oversight. Their feedback is crucial in understanding the system's real impact on their well-being and school experience.\n\n6. **Potential Harm to Vulnerable Students**: For students with ADHD or similar challenges, this system might not only be ineffective but actively harmful, exacerbating their challenges and feelings of alienation.\n\n7. **Lack of Evidence-Based Approach**: The system does not appear to be grounded in scientifically validated educational practices, especially in the context of handling neurodiverse students or those with specific behavioral needs.\n\nAddressing these issues requires a comprehensive review of the system, considering scientific educational practices, inclusivity, and student well-being. It might be beneficial to propose an alternative or a revised approach that is more sensitive to student needs, privacy, and that employs a more nuanced and evidence-based method of tracking and supporting student behavior. Engaging with educational experts, psychologists, and possibly even student representatives could lead to a more effective and ethical system."

                            "Based on the information you've provided about the Learning Behavior Rubik (LBR) system, your concerns appear to be valid from an objective standpoint, especially in the context of educational best practices and ethical considerations. Here's a breakdown of the validity of your concerns:\n\n1. **Lack of Specificity in Assessment**: The broad and vague categories in the LBR system can lead to inconsistent and subjective evaluations. This is a valid concern as effective behavioral assessment tools in educational settings typically require clear, specific criteria to ensure fair and accurate evaluations.\n\n2. **Potential Stigmatization**: Your concern about students being required to visibly carry sheets indicating their behavior status is particularly valid. This practice can lead to stigmatization and negatively impact students' self-esteem and social interactions. Educational best practices emphasize the importance of maintaining student privacy and dignity.\n\n3. **Effectiveness and Impact on Students with ADHD**: The concern about the system\u2019s impact on students with ADHD or similar challenges is grounded in a well-established understanding of these conditions. Effective support for ADHD in educational settings often requires individualized, discreet, and non-stigmatizing approaches, which the LBR system seems to lack.\n\n4. **Lack of Student Feedback**: Not incorporating student feedback is a significant oversight in any educational system. Your concern here aligns with the principle that student involvement is essential for the success and appropriateness of educational interventions.\n\n5. **Punitive Nature of the System**: The use of punitive measures like lunch detentions for non-compliance is a valid concern. Educational research generally supports the use of positive reinforcement and supportive interventions over punitive measures, especially for behavioral issues.\n\n6. **Evidence-Based Practices**: Your worry about the lack of evidence-based approach in the LBR system is justified. Educational policies and interventions should ideally be grounded in scientific research and best practices, particularly when they concern student behavior and well-being.\n\nIn summary, your concerns are not only valid but also align with established principles in educational psychology, ethics, and best practices. It's important for educational systems to be inclusive, evidence-based, and sensitive to the diverse needs of students, especially those with behavioral and learning challenges."

                            "Your application of the \"do no harm\" principle, rooted in your medical background, is highly relevant and appropriate in this educational context. In healthcare, this principle is foundational, prioritizing patient safety above all. Similarly, in education, the welfare and well-being of students should be paramount.\n\n1. **Identifying Positive Aspects**: It is possible that the LBR system has positive intentions or aspects, such as attempting to systematically track and improve student behavior. Recognizing these can be a starting point for dialogue on improving the system.\n\n2. **Need for Evidence**: Your insistence on evidence for the safety and efficacy of the LBR system for all students is crucial. This aligns with evidence-based practices in both medicine and education. Without data supporting its effectiveness and safety, there is a risk of unintentionally causing harm, particularly to vulnerable students.\n\n3. **Improvement and Adaptation**: Suggesting improvements to make the system safer and more effective is a constructive approach. This could involve adapting the system to be more inclusive, less stigmatizing, and better aligned with the needs of students with diverse behavioral and learning profiles.\n\n4. **Consulting Experts**: In the medical field, consulting with specialists is common for complex issues. Similarly, involving educational psychologists, behavioral experts, and possibly child development specialists could provide insights into how the LBR system might be improved or replaced with a more effective approach.\n\n5. **Student-Centered Approach**: The principle of \"do no harm\" in this context translates to a student-centered approach, where the primary focus is on the holistic well-being and development of each student, rather than strictly on behavioral compliance or conformity.\n\nApplying your medical ethos of \"do no harm\" to this educational scenario is a strong and ethically sound approach. It emphasizes the importance of ensuring that educational practices and systems are not only effective but also safe and beneficial for all students."

                            "Ah, so if you could, again, summarize a way taken to consider my passion and emotion, and we know that's not helpful for a convincing case, but the points I make, let's put them in a way that is presentable to the supporters of the LBR. I think some of the positive aspects of it are it facilitates communication between teachers and students and LBR coaches and students. I'm concerned because there's no standardized practice for LBR coaches. These are the kids, these are the teachers that work directly with the kids in the morning who are on the LBR. So the way I do it could be very different than the way another teacher does it, which makes it even harder to collect data or see that it's effective, but the fact that we communicate with students and we work with them and we do what we think is best, even though those things are different, which is the reason some evidence would be helpful. So that's super helpful, and I think it is helpful to identify kids who are having trouble. I don't know that we're collecting good information, though, because of the way the data is collected. The sheet that you carry around is also a spreadsheet, like there's literally lines all over the place and tons of boxes. So from a user experience perspective, I have some experience with that too, it's a disaster for data collection, and the categories are sentences, so there's nine sentences that teachers have to read and then fill out. And it's framed in a way that the teacher has to read all of them. But the number that the teacher puts in is completely subjective, completely subjective, and we found it's different between classes. The reason they go on and off the LBR is completely subjective, and the LBR was derived from an idea in somebody's head and it was never tested, it was just implemented. It's never been modified, ever, in ten years. I think it's good to have a system that does this, but that system should come from safe testing and evidence over time, and modification, and feedback, and modification, and the optimization cycle, the iteration cycle, so there's better ways to do something that tries, the other thing is there's no goal, there's no measure that we can point to and say, hey, we're succeeding, or hey, we're failing, there's nothing, there's no standard. So considering all of my posts on this, especially the emotional ones, how can we frame it in a way that's both serious, but, you know, we're presenting it to the other side."

                            "To constructively present your concerns and suggestions about the Learning Behavior Rubik (LBR) system to its supporters, focusing on evidence-based improvement while acknowledging its positive aspects, you can structure your approach as follows:\n\n1. **Acknowledge the Positives**: Start by recognizing the strengths of the LBR system. Highlight how it facilitates communication between teachers, students, and LBR coaches, and aids in identifying students who need support. This shows that you see the value in the system's intentions and goals.\n\n2. **Express Concerns with Data Collection and Standardization**: Raise the issue of the lack of standardized practice among LBR coaches and the subjective nature of the data collection. Explain how this variability makes it challenging to assess the system\u2019s effectiveness consistently.\n\n3. **Emphasize the Need for Evidence-Based Practices**: Stress the importance of developing educational systems based on safe testing, evidence, and continuous modification. Mention that while the idea behind the LBR is commendable, its implementation without prior testing and ongoing evaluation is a concern.\n\n4. **User Experience and Data Complexity**: Discuss the user experience issues with the current LBR sheet, such as its complex layout and the difficulty in understanding and using the system effectively for data collection.\n\n5. **Subjectivity and Inconsistency**: Address the subjective nature of the teachers\u2019 scoring and the inconsistencies it creates across different classes. This can lead to unreliable data, affecting the system\u2019s credibility and effectiveness.\n\n6. **Lack of Clear Goals and Standards**: Highlight the absence of specific goals or standards that can be used to measure success or failure. This is crucial for any system to evaluate its effectiveness and make necessary improvements.\n\n7. **Propose an Iterative Approach for Improvement**: Suggest adopting an iterative cycle of feedback, modification, and optimization. This approach aligns with best practices in both education and other fields, ensuring continuous improvement.\n\n8. **Call for Collaborative Effort**: Encourage a collaborative effort involving teachers, administrators, educational experts, and possibly psychologists to review and improve the system. Emphasize the collective goal of enhancing student well-being and educational outcomes.\n\n9. **Focus on Constructive Dialogue**: Present your points in a way that invites dialogue rather than confrontation. Show willingness to work together for the betterment of the system.\n\n10. **Emphasize Moral and Ethical Responsibility**: Without being overly emotional, reiterate the moral and ethical responsibility of the educational system to do no harm and to prioritize the well-being of all students.\n\nBy balancing recognition of the system\u2019s positive intentions with constructive criticism based on evidence and best practices, your approach can be both effective and respectful. It shows that your primary concern is the well-being of the students and the improvement of the educational environment."

                            "Certainly. Drawing from your previous messages and adopting your voice, here's an example statement you could use in a meeting or as a written communication:\n\n---\n\n\"Hey everyone, I want to talk about our Learning Behavior Rubik (LBR) system. First off, I see the good in it \u2013 it's great for keeping the lines of communication open between us, the students, and the coaches. It's a solid step in identifying kids who might need extra help. But, and it's a big 'but', we've got some serious blind spots that we can't ignore.\n\nLet's talk about consistency, or the lack thereof. Each of us handles the LBR differently, which, let's be honest, makes gathering any reliable data pretty much impossible. We\u2019re winging it, and while our intentions are good, we're missing the mark on actually helping these kids in a measurable way. \n\nThe data collection? It's a mess. The sheets, the spreadsheets \u2013 they're all over the place. And as someone with a bit of a background in user experience, I can tell you, it's a nightmare. It's not just about the messy sheets; it's about the confusing categories, the subjective nature of scoring. How can we even tell if we're making a difference?\n\nAnd here's the kicker \u2013 we never tested this system before rolling it out. It\u2019s been the same for a decade. No updates, no tweaks based on feedback, nothing. That's not how we should operate. We need to evolve, to iterate. \n\nThere's no clear goal with the LBR, no way to tell if we're succeeding or failing. We're flying blind, and that's not fair to our students. We've got to do better. We owe it to these kids to base our methods on solid, tested principles, not just an idea that sounded good at the time. \n\nI propose we take a hard look at this system. Let\u2019s bring in some evidence-based practices, get some actual data, and start making informed decisions. Let's make the LBR something we can be proud of, something that genuinely helps our students. We have a responsibility to do no harm, to make sure that every kid in our care gets the support they need in a way that's fair, respectful, and effective.\"\n\n---\n\nThis statement balances your strong feelings and concerns with a constructive approach, aiming to initiate a meaningful dialogue for improvement."

                            "Absolutely, here's a formal letter that encapsulates your concerns in a professional yet assertive manner:\n\n---\n\n**[Your Name]**  \n**[Your Position]**  \n**[Your Contact Information]**  \n**[Date]**\n\n**[Recipient's Name]**  \n**[Recipient's Position]**  \n**[School/Organization Name]**\n\nDear [Recipient's Name],\n\nI am writing to address a matter of significant importance regarding our current Learning Behavior Rubik (LBR) system. As someone deeply committed to the well-being and development of our students, I feel compelled to share my perspective on this issue.\n\nFirst, I acknowledge the positive intentions behind the LBR system. It undoubtedly serves as a valuable tool for facilitating communication between teachers, students, and LBR coaches. Identifying students who require additional support is crucial, and in this regard, the LBR system has been beneficial.\n\nHowever, there are aspects of the LBR system that warrant critical review and improvement. My concern primarily lies with the inconsistency in its implementation and the subjective nature of its data collection. The lack of standardized practice among LBR coaches leads to a significant variability in how the system is applied, which in turn affects the reliability and effectiveness of the data gathered.\n\nMoreover, the user experience with the LBR sheets and spreadsheets is notably challenging, hindering efficient and accurate data collection. This complexity not only affects us as educators but also impacts our ability to provide targeted support to our students. Additionally, the subjective scoring system and the variability in application across different classes compromise the integrity of the system, making it difficult to assess its true impact.\n\nIt is also concerning that the LBR system was implemented without prior testing or validation and has not undergone any significant modifications in the past decade. An evidence-based approach, incorporating safe testing, ongoing evaluation, and iterative modifications, is essential for any educational tool to ensure its effectiveness and relevance.\n\nThe absence of clear goals and measurable outcomes further complicates our ability to gauge the success of the LBR system. Without these, we risk operating in a vacuum, unable to ascertain whether we are truly meeting the needs of our students.\n\nIn light of these concerns, I propose a collaborative review of the LBR system. Engaging with educational experts, psychologists, and most importantly, incorporating feedback from our students and teachers, could lead to significant improvements. Our shared goal is the betterment of our educational environment and the welfare of our students, and I believe that through collective effort and an evidence-based approach, we can enhance the effectiveness of the LBR system.\n\nThank you for considering my perspective on this matter. I am eager to work together towards developing a more robust, effective, and empathetic system for our students.\n\nRespectfully,\n\n**[Your Name]**\n\n---\n\nThis letter maintains a respectful tone while clearly conveying the seriousness of your concerns and your commitment to improving the system."

Students are required to carry around color-coded sheets that publicly display their behavioral status. This practice can inadvertently stigmatize and embarrass students, particularly those with inherent behavioral traits or conditions, such as ADHD. Speaking from personal experience, having navigated through my own school years with similar challenges, I understand the profound impact such visibility can have on a student's self-esteem and school experience.\n\nThis method of public labeling, regardless of its intention, can lead to unintended negative consequences. It not only singles out students but also potentially exposes them to undue scrutiny and judgment from their peers. We must remember that some behavioral issues are deeply ingrained and not easily altered. Our role as educators is not to highlight these challenges publicly but to provide discreet and empathetic support. It is imperative that we reevaluate this aspect of the LBR system to ensure we are not inadvertently harming those we aim to help.\n\n---\n\nYou can insert this paragraph into the formal letter where it best fits the flow of your overall message. This addition effectively communicates your personal connection to the issue and underscores the importance of considering the emotional and psychological well-being of the students in any behavioral assessment system."

My other thesis that I haven't discussed with you yet, but the schedule, I do six classes a day. I do three grade levels a day. My planning is somewhat broken up in between those. So I have 20 minutes in between classes, 10 minutes after lunch, and then 50 minutes in the morning. And the fragmentation and the task switching, and running an entire 30 computer lab, and planning lessons and grading, and updating 30 Macs, which are password heavy, and keeping up to date with technological trends that are moving so fast. Math really isn't changing for middle school students, but what's relevant in technology is. So with all that said, I need way more time because I'm working after school. I will use that LBR time to perform routine and upgrade maintenance on the computers, and I still won't have enough time to do it all. So that fills the vacuum that's going to be left by me not participating in the LBR. Additionally, I don't think we should build the LBR system. I am a computer science teacher. I am not an expert in behavioral psychology. I've spent my whole life with this ADD, and I am just as bad as I was when I was a kid. This is after therapy, medication, it's just a disability. I cannot organize, and I get distracted. Meditation helps, but I have to develop strategies. I haven't even developed a strategy that works for me yet. That's the honest truth. So with all that just said, can you review the previous post that we did? Look for examples of anything I just said, and then construct, I don't know, as many more paragraphs as you need. It's not necessary that we construct an entire letter in one piece, but I think if we construct enough useful paragraphs, I can put it together in one piece. So with all that said, add a few more paragraphs."

Given my responsibilities as a computer science teacher and the manager of a 30-computer lab, the fragmented nature of my schedule poses significant challenges. With the rapid advancement of technology, staying abreast of the latest trends and ensuring our equipment is up-to-date and functional is critical. This task is both time-consuming and essential, especially in an era where technological literacy is integral to our students' education.\n\nThe 20 minutes in the morning, currently dedicated to the LBR system, could be more effectively used for routine maintenance and upgrading of our computer lab. This change would address the pressing need for consistent technological upkeep, an area that is currently under-resourced given the complexity and frequency of required updates. Despite this reallocation of time, I must emphasize that even with this adjustment, the demands of my role exceed the available time, often necessitating additional work hours beyond the school day.\n\nFurthermore, as a professional specializing in computer science, not behavioral psychology, I find the expectations of participating in the LBR system to be misaligned with my expertise. While I am deeply committed to supporting our students, my personal journey with ADD has taught me the complexities of such conditions. Despite years of therapy, medication, and various strategies, managing ADD remains a significant challenge for me. This personal experience underscores my belief that addressing behavioral issues requires specialized knowledge and approaches, which I am not equipped to provide.\n\nIn light of this, it becomes evident that our approach to student behavior, particularly through systems like the LBR, needs thoughtful reevaluation. We must consider the diverse needs of our students and the unique expertise of each educator. A system designed to support behavioral development should be grounded in evidence-based practices and handled by professionals trained in this specific area.\n\n---\n\nThese paragraphs address your personal experiences and professional responsibilities, providing a clear rationale for the proposed reallocation of your time and offering a perspective on the limitations of your role in the context of the LBR system. You can integrate these paragraphs into your letter to create a comprehensive and coherent message."

The reason is because as a teacher I am able to provide basic behavioral help, basic stuff. It just doesn't work for me. And I am dealing with kids that need that kind of work. I am not equipped. So how do I say in one or two sentences, this is exactly the thing I am not equipped to deal with? I say while I can deal with general behaviors and offer strategies for behaviors and stuff that I was taught in college, targeted strategies like those with ADHD that I see in so many of my students, I am not equipped, trained I have never found a solution for myself.

I would like to make it safe for school, for middle school students, and try deploying it. Deploying it. This would go great being the guy who builds tools with OpenAI's API and even Microsoft AutoGen for the school that could help. And this is something that we could test we could test and see if it helps and we could get real feedback and we could make placebos and we could do real safe adequate testing and you could check on regulations for me and we could be sure we're using best practices.

                            "Your idea of developing a tool similar to this interaction model, tailored for middle school students, particularly those with ADHD, is indeed a forward-thinking and potentially impactful concept. Leveraging technology like GPT and other AI tools to assist students in organizing their thoughts and enhancing their learning experience aligns well with contemporary educational needs. Here are some steps and considerations for developing such a tool:\n\n1. **Defining the Tool's Purpose**: Clearly outline what the tool will do \u2013 whether it's helping with organization, providing feedback on ideas, assisting in writing, or other educational support.\n\n2. **Collaboration with Experts**: Partnering with educational and behavioral experts, especially those specializing in ADHD and learning disabilities, will be crucial. They can provide insights into the specific needs and challenges of your target user group.\n\n3. **Safe and Ethical Design**: Ensure the tool is designed with privacy and safety in mind, especially given the young age of the intended users. Adhering to regulations like COPPA (Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Act) will be essential.\n\n4. **User-Friendly Interface**: The tool should have an intuitive, engaging, and age-appropriate interface to cater to middle school students.\n\n5. **Pilot Testing and Feedback**: Implement pilot testing in a controlled environment, gather feedback from students and teachers, and make necessary adjustments. This iterative process is key to refining the tool.\n\n6. **Regulatory Compliance and Best Practices**: Stay informed about educational regulations and best practices in technology use in schools. This might involve consulting with legal experts or educational authorities.\n\n7. **Integration with School Curriculum**: Consider how the tool can complement and integrate with existing curricula and teaching methods.\n\n8. **Measuring Impact**: Establish clear metrics to evaluate the tool\u2019s effectiveness, such as improvements in student organization, engagement, or academic performance.\n\n9. **Securing Funding and Support**: Explore funding opportunities or partnerships with organizations interested in educational technology and innovation.\n\n10. **Continuous Improvement**: Be prepared to continuously update and improve the tool based on user feedback and advancements in AI and educational research.\n\nYour passion for leveraging technology to enhance education, especially for students with ADHD, is commendable. This project could not only align with your expertise but also potentially make a significant difference in the learning experience of many students."

I subscribe to the TLDR newsletters and they're excellent in providing the day's summary in different sectors and I don't know any other educators who stay up to date like that. But I do know that AI and its friends in technology are in fact coming to education and they're going to come in all forms. There is going to be good solutions and there is going to be snake oil. I'm right now trying to implement it before the rush. There's a lot of things I am able to and would love to do, I just don't have the time or authorization. I have 120 students across three grade levels and six classes going in and out of my classroom. I have new kids each quarter. So I get every kid in the school every year and I see them over a period of three years. So we have both short-term magnitude in terms of student volume and long-term longitudinal study potential in terms of tracking individuals over time. This is a profound opportunity for testing and implementing effective, safe strategies for education, cognitive, social and emotional development.

                            "Also, if they do this, I would be happy to train the incoming computer science teacher, especially if they don't have experience. That makes it much easier to find somebody to replace me. I mean, technically, if I had the time, I could develop a curriculum that's automated and engaging. I mean, the computer science class, honestly, could eventually be the one experience they have in school in front of a computer that teaches them how to use the computer to leverage the information available to them, especially in an underprivileged community where college opportunities aren't available for most. We could have a system that is computer science, and it teaches some basic concepts, but it also teaches kids how to use the computer. Because I feel like what I've seen over the past few years, and actually the past five years especially, is I've seen greater value in a student that can be independent on the computer. What do I mean? I think if I had one thing to teach a student, it wouldn't be how to code. It would be how to learn how to code. It wouldn't be how to replace computer parts. It would be how to learn how to replace computer parts. Or how to learn and how to best engage with learning online. Because I don't know what they're going to need to know in five years, but I know that if they can teach themselves and already have experience doing that on the computer, in a safe and controlled environment where they see success, where success for them is built in, and they can say, oh my gosh, I can do this. That's kind of where my computer science class is going anyway."

                            "This way, and I hope I've mentioned this before in the chat, you might have to search, but it's the LBR system itself, and there's another objective. I'll just brief you on it. The school goal is to score high on IREDI, and every resource has been put into it to the exclusion of other things. This is kind of what I was saying before where the pseudoscience comes in. They're so hyper-focused on one problem, they're missing the bigger picture, and they're looking for evidence only with one metric. IREDI scores. That's it. They're not looking at declining math scores or teacher burnout or things like that. Or this schedule. While all of their teachers have four classes a day at the same grade level with the same kids all year and fewer kids and more complete planning time, our classes, specials, like computer science and physical education and art, have six classes a day across three grade levels. And fragmented planning time. They do this schedule in order to increase IREDI scores. Because this way they can fit in a reading intervention. As a side note, I don't think it is a reading problem. I think reading is a symptom of another problem that has to do with learning helplessness and attention. But that's a different thing. We have a lot of teachers off the street, meaning we just take people and train them to be teachers. And the standard of teaching has lowered. And so has soft skills. The teaching of soft skills. And with that we've seen decline not only in reading, but math, the ability to write, the ability to ask questions, the ability to pay attention, the ability to follow a direction. And tons of behavior issues. So I think we're hyper focused on a symptom of a larger problem. But anyway, the schedule comes from that. And I want the schedule changed. But if I get this new position, not only do they not have to change the schedule, I can have an entire curriculum handed over to the incoming teacher and we can work over time to automate it more without reducing effectiveness by implementing new technologies. So people, like teachers, can spend more time with students instead of building curriculum and grading and mundane tasks."

                            "Your analysis of the current situation at your school highlights several critical issues and proposes a strategic direction that could address them more holistically. To summarize and expand on your points:\n\n1. **Narrow Focus on IREDI Scores**: The school's singular focus on IREDI scores is leading to the neglect of other important educational aspects. Such a narrow metric doesn't capture the full spectrum of student learning and development. This hyper-focus could be masking underlying issues in other areas like math, writing, and soft skills.\n\n2. **Impact of Scheduling on Specials**: The current schedule, designed to maximize IREDI scores, places undue strain on teachers of specials like computer science, art, and physical education. You face challenges like managing six classes a day across three grade levels with fragmented planning time.\n\n3. **Reading as a Symptom, Not the Core Issue**: Your insight that reading difficulties might be symptomatic of deeper problems, such as learned helplessness or attention issues, is noteworthy. This perspective suggests that interventions should address broader cognitive and behavioral skills.\n\n4. **Decline in Teaching Standards and Soft Skills**: The observation that the standard of teaching and soft skills has declined, coupled with the influx of inexperienced teachers, indicates a need for stronger teacher training and professional development.\n\n5. **Behavioral Issues and Overall Decline in Academic Skills**: The increase in behavioral issues and the decline in academic skills across various subjects suggest that the school's current strategy might not be effectively addressing students' holistic educational needs.\n\n6. **Proposal for Schedule Change and Role Transition**: Your suggestion to change the current schedule aligns with the need to address these broader issues. In your proposed new position, you could develop a comprehensive, automated curriculum for computer science. This would not only facilitate a smoother transition for your successor but also allow for more personalized and effective teaching.\n\n7. **Leveraging Technology for Efficiency**: By implementing new technologies, teachers can reduce time spent on administrative tasks like curriculum development and grading. This can free up more time for direct student engagement, potentially improving educational outcomes.\n\n8. **Focus on Teacher-Student Interaction**: Your proposal emphasizes enhancing teacher-student interactions, which is crucial for student development. More teacher time can be devoted to addressing individual student needs, fostering a more supportive and effective learning environment.\n\n9. **Long-Term Vision**: Your vision includes a long-term strategy for continuous improvement and adaptation of the curriculum, ensuring its relevance and effectiveness in an ever-evolving educational landscape.\n\nYour approach tackles the root causes rather than just the symptoms of the challenges your school faces. It considers the broader educational ecosystem, emphasizing the importance of holistic strategies over narrow, metric-focused ones. This comprehensive view could lead to more sustainable and impactful educational improvements."

                            "Also, I want to bring up one other point about a point of concern. During COVID, I was a virtual teacher teaching kids at home that couldn't go to school. And I was deeply concerned because there were parents who were listening in on the lessons and chastising teachers for the content they were teaching. There is evidence that this kind of practice led to, let's say, movements of more parents going to school board meetings about curriculum and things like, maybe not directly, but things like American Birthright Standards and all these standards changing. They're using what they heard on those things. My problem was the district didn't defend against it. They didn't defend the teachers. They didn't call parents and say, don't do that. And it was dangerous. This past weekend, a student called home to a teacher and demanded that his grade be changed, even though he didn't turn in an assignment, so he could play in a football game or a basketball game and wasn't excluded for having a zero for an assignment he didn't turn in. He called the teacher at home on a Sunday. One of our administrators commended that and argued against the teachers who are saying that crossed the line. My issue is, given the current events, the threats of violence, the things that start off as criticisms, then personal attacks, then threats and maybe even physical attacks, doxing, that kind of stuff going on. If we let students call teachers at home, their parents are likely to call next, you know, next, whatever, six months. And then when they don't get the results they want by calling home, who knows? Anyway, I think this is a line that should be defended, and I think the administrator should be talked to for it."

                            "Your concerns about the boundaries between teachers' professional and personal lives, and the potential escalation of conflicts with parents and students, are both valid and significant. Here\u2019s a structured way to address these issues:\n\n1. **Privacy and Professional Boundaries**: Emphasize the importance of maintaining clear boundaries between teachers' professional responsibilities and their personal lives. Teachers should not be expected to be available outside of school hours, especially at their personal residences. This is a basic workplace boundary that applies in most professions.\n\n2. **Precedent and Escalation Risks**: Point out the risks associated with setting a precedent where students and parents feel entitled to intrude on teachers' personal time. This can lead to escalating demands and potentially more serious conflicts or confrontations, as you've noted.\n\n3. **Safety and Well-being of Staff**: Highlight the potential safety risks and stress associated with such intrusions. Teachers' well-being and sense of safety are crucial for them to perform their jobs effectively.\n\n4. **Lack of Administrative Support**: Express your concern about the apparent lack of support from the administration in these situations. The administration's role should include protecting and upholding the rights and well-being of their staff.\n\n5. **Policy and Guidelines**: Advocate for clear policies and guidelines that define the acceptable channels and times for communication between teachers, students, and parents. These should be communicated and enforced consistently.\n\n6. **Training on Handling Conflicts**: Suggest training for teachers and administrators on handling conflicts and setting boundaries with students and parents. This can provide them with tools and strategies to deal with such situations effectively and respectfully.\n\n7. **Addressing the Specific Incident**: Regarding the incident of the student calling a teacher at home, recommend that this be discussed at an administrative level to clarify why it was inappropriate and to ensure it doesn't happen again.\n\n8. **Open Dialogue with Parents and Community**: Encourage open dialogue with parents and the school community about mutual respect, appropriate communication channels, and the shared goal of creating a positive and effective learning environment.\n\n9. **Seeking Support from Higher Authorities**: If necessary, consider bringing these concerns to higher authorities in the education system or relevant educational boards, especially if the local administration is not responsive.\n\n10. **Documentation and Reporting**: Advise teachers to document any inappropriate communications or incidents and report them according to the school's protocols. This creates a record that can be used to support the need for policy changes.\n\nAddressing these issues requires a careful balance of assertiveness in upholding professional boundaries while maintaining a constructive dialogue with all stakeholders involved."

Surveys of both \u301095\u2020parents\u2020mottpoll.org\u3011 and \u301096\u2020educators\u2020www.rand.org\u3011 highlight concerning trends in children\u2019s emotional well-being and mental health. These concerns are heightened for children of color, who were significantly \u301097\u2020more likely\u2020publications.aap.org\u3011 to lose a parent or caregiver from a COVID-19 related death. \u301098\u2020Recent\u2020caldercenter.org\u3011 \u301099\u2020research\u2020journals.sagepub.com\u3011 evaluating the effects of the pandemic on students\u2019 learning trajectories reflects this reality. Learning rates slowed during the pandemic for most students, and even more so for students of color and students from low-income families.\nL294: \nL295: To support students, families, and schools in recovering from the varied harms of the pandemic, Congress has provided U.S. public schools with $190 billion in federal relief aid over the last three years. Many \u3010100\u2020school districts\u2020live-fe-future-ed.pantheonsite.io\u3011 are using some of these resources to fund academic interventions like summer and after-school programs and high-dosage tutoring that families can sign their children up for.\nL296: \nL297: \u3010101\u2020News\u2020www.the74million.org\u3011 \u3010102\u2020reports\u2020www.chalkbeat.org\u3011 and \u3010103\u2020recent research\u2020edworkingpapers.com\u3011 indicate that participation in these opt-in recovery programs may be low. Some \u3010104\u2020researchers\u2020www.the74million.org\u3011 argue that low participation rates indicate low levels of parent interest in academic recovery efforts. However, a broader literature on family engagement in education suggests that insights gleaned from families\u2019 participation in recovery programs may be limited.\nL298: \nL299: Here, we interrogate what we do and do not know about families\u2019 interest in and engagement with COVID-19 recovery programs based on the limited research to date. We also summarize broader literatures on family engagement that can support education leaders working to better engage families in COVID-19 relief efforts.\u3010105\u2020[1]\u3011\nL300: \nL301: ## Surveys of Families Provide Limited Insights\nL302: \nL303: First, let\u2019s understand what we do and do not know about parents\u2019 interest in COVID-19 recovery programs. According to a recent \u3010106\u2020nationally representative survey\u3011, low shares of parents were interested in enrolling their child in either tutoring (28%) or summer school (23%) in spring 2022. Results from the same survey \u3010107\u2020reported elsewhere\u2020www.urban.org\u3011 show significant variation by family background, with Black, Asian, Latino, and low-income families significantly more likely to express interest in academic recovery programs relative to White and more affluent families. For example, about 35% of Black parents expressed interest in summer school compared to less than 20% of White families, with similarly large differences observed for interest in tutoring.\nL304: \nL305: How the authors define parent interest is an important limitation of these results (a limitation the authors acknowledge). In particular, the survey uses parents\u2019 participation in recovery programs (conditional on being offered an available seat) as a proxy for parents\u2019 interest. This definition likely underestimates parents\u2019 interest in academic recovery programs. This is because families\u2019 participation in recovery interventions is almost certainly influenced by factors unrelated to their interest\u2014e.g., program eligibility rules, scheduling issues, and transportation access. Put another way, this definition does not account for barriers families may face in accessing COVID-19 recovery programs for their children.\nL306: \nL307: More importantly, these survey results leave unanswered critical questions as to why reported participation rates may be low.\nL308: \nL309: One hypothesis that \u3010104\u2020some \u2020www.the74million.org\u3011\u3010108\u2020researchers\u2020www.washingtonpost.com\u3011 have put forth is that parents are overly optimistic about their children\u2019s academic recovery from the effects of the pandemic. For example, according to a survey released earlier this fall by \u3010109\u2020Education Next\u2020www.educationnext.org\u3011, 43% of parents report that their children did not experience any learning losses during the pandemic.\nL310: \nL311: These results are being framed as potentially worrisome in part because they do not comport with researchers\u2019 understanding of the breadth and magnitude of pandemic harm on test score growth. This misalignment may be driven by differences in the types of information available to parents relative to the information used in academic research.\u3010110\u2020[2]\u3011\nL312: \nL313: Regardless, the research to date leaves unanswered questions that are important for ensuring the success of COVID-19 recovery efforts in schools. Questions like: How do parents understand their children\u2019s academic and emotional well-being needs in the context of COVID-19 recovery? How are parents making decisions about whether they enroll their children in COVID-19 recovery interventions? And what potential\nVisible: 27% - 53%",

Put another way, this definition does not account for barriers families may face in accessing COVID-19 recovery programs for their children.\nL306: \nL307: More importantly, these survey results leave unanswered critical questions as to why reported participation rates may be low.\nL308: \nL309: One hypothesis that some researchers have put forth is that parents are overly optimistic about their children\u2019s academic recovery from the effects of the pandemic. For example, according to a survey released earlier this fall by Education Next, 43% of parents report that their children did not experience any learning losses during the pandemic.\nL310: \nL311: These results are being framed as potentially worrisome in part because they do not comport with researchers\u2019 understanding of the breadth and magnitude of pandemic harm on test score growth. This misalignment may be driven by differences in the types of information available to parents relative to the information used in academic research.[2]\nL312: \nL313: Regardless, the research to date leaves unanswered questions that are important for ensuring the success of COVID-19 recovery efforts in schools. Questions like: How do parents understand their children\u2019s academic and emotional well-being needs in the context of COVID-19 recovery? How are parents making decisions about whether they enroll their children in COVID-19 recovery interventions? And what potential\nVisible: 27% - 53%",

If COVID-19 recovery efforts are going to meaningfully aid students and their families, family engagement must be a critical component of those efforts. \u3010112\u2020Work\u2020eric.ed.gov\u3011 in this area makes an important distinction between family involvement and family engagement.\nL318: \nL319: ## School-Driven Family Involvement Has Limitations\nL320: \nL321: Family involvement is typically characterized by structured ways for parents to support their child\u2019s learning as prescribed by schools. For example, family involvement includes \u3010113\u2020activities\u2020journals.sagepub.com\u3011 like attending parent-teacher conferences, chaperoning school field trips, and engaging in other volunteer activities, but can also take the form of participation in school-based decision-making bodies like \u3010114\u2020parent-teacher organizations\u2020journals.sagepub.com\u3011.\nL322: \nL323: While some \u3010115\u2020research\u2020www.tandfonline.com\u3011 suggests activities like this support student learning, other scholars argue that those effects can be explained by ethno-racial and socio-economic differences in the types of parents (e.g., white, middle-class parents) most likely to engage in prescribed forms of family involvement. For example, \u3010116\u2020one study\u2020journals.sagepub.com\u3011 found that while family involvement activities such as attending parent-teacher conferences, PTO membership, volunteering at school, and homework checking are positively associated with test scores, this relationship is notably weaker\u2014and perhaps even negative\u2014after accounting for students\u2019 race/ethnicity, socio-economic status, and baseline test scores.\nL324: \nL325: Indeed, scholars have cautioned that families from less socio-economically advantaged backgrounds and families of color often encounter significant barriers to participating in schools in these highly prescribed ways. For example, \u3010117\u2020one study\u2020journals.sagepub.com\u3011 found that negative interactions with teachers and other parents, as well as scheduling challenges, limited Black parents\u2019 involvement with school-based activities.\nL326: \nL327: Moreover, conceptualizing family involvement in narrow ways that are not inclusive of families who may have less time to donate or less relational trust with educators can exacerbate educational inequalities. For example, \u3010118\u2020research\u2020journals.sagepub.com\u3011 shows that family involvement often yields additional benefits to highly involved (typically more affluent, white) families while simultaneously perpetuating negative stereotypes about less involved families (typically low-income families and families of color).\nL328: \nL329: In the context of this research, recent surveys and reports showing low family uptake of academic recovery programs may be telling us more of what we already know: when schools expect families to engage in highly prescribed ways without sufficient stakeholder engagement, families may not participate. Claims that parents lack \u201cinterest\u201d in their children\u2019s education based on participation rates ignore \u3010119\u2020existing structures and practices\u2020academic.oup.com\u3011 that limit parents\u2019 participation in schools and incorrectly shift blame for educational inequalities onto families.\nL330: \nL331: ## Partnership-Driven Family Engagement Shows Promise for COVID-19 Recovery\nL332: \nL333: Moving beyond prescriptive roles for parents, family engagement is characterized by reciprocal relationships (grounded in relational trust) between educators and families\u2014with the goal of working as partners to support student learning and school improvement. According to \u3010112\u2020one scholar\u2020eric.ed.gov\u3011 of community organizing for school reform, \u201cparental engagement designates parents as citizens in the fullest sense\u2014change agents who can transform urban schools and neighborhoods.\u201d For example, family engagement practices include educators and families working in partnership to co-design engagement agendas, strategies, and initiatives, and consistently seeking out families\u2019 expertise in the education of their children\u2014all with the aim of sharing decision-making power with families and communities.\nL334: \nL335: Research demonstrates that family engagement has many benefits, including promoting the success of \u3010120\u2020school reform efforts\u2020journals.sagepub.com\u3011, deepening leaders\u2019 and educators\u2019 understanding of \u3010121\u2020stakeholder perspectives\u2020us.corwin.com\u3011, and supporting \u3010122\u2020child development outcomes\u2020psycnet.apa.org\u3011. \u3010123\u2020Justice-based approaches\u2020nepc.colorado.edu\u3011 to family engagement recognize families as experts who can help build more equitable education systems. And considering the inequality-intensifying effects of the pandemic, it is critical that any engagement work is inclusive of all families, particularly communities of color, low-income families, and immigrant families.\nL336: \nL337: How can schools develop stronger approaches to family-school engagement? A report recently commissioned by the Carnegie Corporation of New York outlines a research-based framework\u2014\u3010124\u2020the Dual Capacity-Building Framework for Family-School Partnerships\u2020media.carnegie.org\u3011\u2013for developing strong family-school engagement that is grounded in anti-racist and social justice principles. This framework argues that for schools to meaningfully improve family-school engagement, schools need to build capacity for this type of partnership work among both educators and families and work to improve certain organizational conditions necessary for family-school partnerships to be successful. (For additional ideas on strategies schools can pursue to improve family-school partnerships, see \u3010125\u2020work\u3011 by our colleagues in Brookings\u2019 Center for Universal Education.)\nL338: \nL339: Some of our own \u3010126\u2020research\u2020epicedpolicy.org\u3011 in Michigan suggests that strong relationships with families helped insulate schools from the worst outcomes during the pandemic. Districts that demonstrated better-than-predicted achievement growth in the 2020-2021 school year engaged in consistent and clear two-way communication with families. Further, these districts had strong existing relationships with families that provided a foundation for effectively supporting student learning during crisis.\nL340: \nL341: ## Moving Towards a Family-Centered Approach to COVID-19 Recovery\nL342: \nL343: Recent surveys of parents above all else underscore that family engagement in COVID-19 recovery efforts cannot be an afterthought. Family engagement in COVID-19 relief spending is a priority for the \u3010127\u2020Biden-Harris administration\u2020www.edweek.org\u3011. Yet, low shares of states and districts included explicit family engagement strategies in their \u3010128\u2020COVID-19 spending plans\u2020live-fe-future-ed.pantheonsite.io\u3011.\nL344: \nL345: Some education policy \u3010104\u2020experts\u2020www.the74million.org\u3011 are recommending that districts consider adopting opt-out policies where opt-in participation is low. We argue that where opt-in rates are low, district and school officials should interpret that as a clear signal that parents and families have not been sufficiently engaged in decision-making. One lesson emerging from \u3010129\u2020early work\u2020edtrust.org\u3011 on implementing COVID-19 academic recovery programs is that family engagement is critical to a program\u2019s success. Before making voluntary programs mandatory, school leaders and educators should engage with families and students to understand why participation rates were low in the first place and determine together what adjustments should be made.\nL346: \nL347: COVID-19 relief funding provides a unique opportunity to rebuild public education after an exceptionally challenging two years. As Anne Ishimaru and Megan Bang have \u3010123\u2020argued\u2020nepc.colorado.edu\u3011, we need to \u201crecast families and communities as co-designers of education\u201d rather than conceptualizing families as the recipients of services or even worse as barriers to implementation.\nL348: \nL349: The road ahead for districts and schools will be challenging. Family engagement efforts will have to contend with the \u3010130\u2020historic failures\u2020journals.sagepub.com\u3011 of school systems to effectively serve marginalized communities. Researchers can aid these efforts by fostering \u3010131\u2020research-practice partnerships\u2020journals.sagepub.com\u3011 focused on developing family engagement practices grounded in educational equity. Without these efforts, school districts risk spending limited COVID-19 relief aid on programs and initiatives that don\u2019t meet the needs of students and families and won\u2019t remedy pandemic harms on student learning.\nL350: \nL351: * * *\nL352: \nL353: Footnotes:\nL354: \nL355: \u3010105\u2020[1]\u3011 Note that we use the terms \u201cparent\u201d and \u201cfamily\u201d interchangeably as both are used in this literature.

One lesson emerging from early work on implementing COVID-19 academic recovery programs is that family engagement is critical to a program\u2019s success. Before making voluntary programs mandatory, school leaders and educators should engage with families and students to understand why participation rates were low in the first place and determine together what adjustments should be made.\nL346: \nL347: COVID-19 relief funding provides a unique opportunity to rebuild public education after an exceptionally challenging two years. As Anne Ishimaru and Megan Bang have argued, we need to \u201crecast families and communities as co-designers of education\u201d rather than conceptualizing families as the recipients of services or even worse as barriers to implementation.\nL348: \nL349: The road ahead for districts and schools will be challenging. Family engagement efforts will have to contend with the historic failures of school systems to effectively serve marginalized communities. Researchers can aid these efforts by fostering research-practice partnerships focused on developing family engagement practices grounded in educational equity. Without these efforts, school districts risk spending limited COVID-19 relief aid on programs and initiatives that don\u2019t meet the needs of students and families and won\u2019t remedy pandemic harms on student learning.\nL350: \nL351: * * *\nL352: \nL353: Footnotes:\nL354: \nL355: [1] Note that we use the terms \u201cparent\u201d and \u201cfamily\u201d interchangeably as both are used in this literature.

The coronavirus forced \u301048\u2020widespread school closings\u2020www.washingtonpost.com\u3011 across the United States, and many parents had to work with their children to \u301049\u2020adjust to online learning\u3011. \nL62: \nL63: [Image 0: Majority of parents whose children have learned online during the pandemic say their online instruction has gone well]\nL64: \nL65: This survey finds that 93% of parents with children in grades K-12 say their children have had some online instruction since the beginning of the coronavirus outbreak in February 2020. Majorities of these parents say they generally have had positive experiences when it comes to their children\u2019s online learning.\nL66: \nL67: Among parents whose children have had some online instruction during the pandemic, 62% say online instruction has gone very or somewhat well and 70% say they have had a very or somewhat easy experience helping their children use technology and the internet for online instruction. \nL68: \nL69: Still, 30% of parents whose children have had any online instruction since the beginning of the coronavirus outbreak say they have had a very or somewhat difficult time helping their children use technology and the internet for this purpose. Certain groups of these parents are particularly likely to say they have had a difficult time helping their children with online learning. For example, 36% of mothers of children who learned online say they had a very or somewhat difficult time helping their children with technology and the internet for online instruction, compared with 21% of fathers. \nL70: \nL71: [Image 1: Mothers, parents with lower incomes more likely than fathers and those with higher incomes to have trouble helping their children with tech for online learning ]\nL72: \nL73: This challenge is also prevalent for parents in certain types of communities \u2013 39% of rural residents and 33% of urban residents say they have had at least some difficulty, compared with 23% of suburban residents. And those with lower and middle incomes are more likely than those with higher incomes to report this difficulty. \nL74: \nL75: Among broadband users, connection quality also plays a role in parents\u2019 experience in helping their children with online learning. \nL76: \nL77: Some 34% of parents who say they often or sometimes experience internet problems also say they have a relatively difficult time helping their children with technology and the internet for online instruction, compared with 22% of parents who never or rarely have internet problems. \nL78: \nL79: ### Parents with lower incomes more likely than parents with higher incomes to say their children had technology-related difficulties with schoolwork\nL80: \nL81: This survey, which follows up on findings reported near the \u301050\u2020beginning of the pandemic\u3011 about the problems parents thought their children might face, shows that some parents report that their children have faced technology-related difficulties while completing school assignments since the coronavirus outbreak began.\nL82: \nL83: [Image 2: Parents with lower incomes more likely than parents with higher incomes to say their children have faced tech-related schoolwork challenges in the pandemic]\nL84: \nL85: The April 2021 survey shows that roughly a quarter (27%) of parents with children whose schools were closed at some point during the pandemic say their children had to do their schoolwork on a cellphone. Smaller shares of these parents say their children were unable to complete schoolwork because they did not have access to a computer at home (16%) or had to use public Wi\u2011Fi to finish their schoolwork because there was not a reliable internet connection at home (14%). And roughly a third (34%) of parents whose children\u2019s schools were closed at some point say their children encountered at least one of these three challenges in trying to complete their schoolwork. \nL86: \nL87: The shares among these parents with children whose schools closed at some point vary based on household income and show that parents with lower incomes were more likely to report their children had these tech-related problems. For instance, 25% of parents with lower incomes say their children with closed schools could not complete their schoolwork because of a lack of computer access. This share is 23 percentage points higher than for parents who have higher incomes (2%). Parents with lower incomes are also far more likely than those in the upper-income tier to say their children encountered at least one of these obstacles during the pandemic (46% vs. 18%). And 9% of these parents in lower-income households say their children experienced all three of these obstacles. \nL88: \nL89: In a survey near the beginning of the pandemic last year, the Center \u301051\u2020asked parents\u3011 about whether they anticipated these problems for their children. In April 2020, 29% of parents with children whose schools were closed at that time said it was very or somewhat likely that in completing schoolwork at home during the coronavirus outbreak, their children would have to do their schoolwork on a cellphone. About one-in-five of the same set of parents said this about children having to use public Wi-Fi to finish their schoolwork because of a lack of a reliable internet connection at home or being unable to complete their schoolwork because they did not have access to a computer at home. And 38% of these parents said their children would be very or somewhat likely to encounter at least one of these tech-related obstacles for schoolwork.\nL90: \nL91: ### Growing share of adults say schools should provide technology to all students in order to complete schoolwork during the pandemic\nL92: \nL93: [Image 3: Roughly half of adults say schools have responsibility to provide technology to all students during pandemic]\nL94: \nL95: Since the pandemic began, public attitudes have shifted and become more supportive of the idea that schools have a responsibility to provide all students with laptop or tablet computers to help them complete schoolwork during the pandemic. \nL96: \nL97: The new survey finds that 49% of U.S. adults say that K-12 schools have a responsibility to provide all students with laptop or tablet computers in order to help them complete their schoolwork at home during the COVID-19 outbreak \u2013 a 12 percentage point increase from April 2020. At the same time, the share of Americans who say otherwise has decreased since last year. The portions who say schools only have a responsibility for students whose families cannot afford technology and that schools do not have this responsibility each fell by 6 points.\nL98: \nL99: While larger shares of both parties now say K-12 schools have a responsibility to provide computers to all students in order to help them complete schoolwork at home, there is a 15-point change among Republicans: 43% of Republicans now say K-12 schools have this responsibility, compared with 28% last April. In the new survey, 22% of Republicans also say schools do not have this responsibility at all, compared with 6% of Democrats. And Democrats are still more likely than Republicans to say K-12 schools have a responsibility to provide computers to all students to help them complete schoolwork at home.\nL100: \nL101: Adults with lower incomes are also more likely than those who have middle or higher incomes to say K-12 schools should provide technology to all students. And adults in lower-income households who say this have seen a 10-point increase since 2020.\nL102: \nL103: ### Majority of parents of K-12 children say their kids are spending more time in front of screens; 39% say they have become less strict about screen time\nL104: \nL105: As many parents settled at home and adjusted to online learning for their children, a majority observed changing screen time patterns for their children.\nL106: \nL107: [Image 4: Roughly seven-in-ten parents say their children are spending more time in front of screens than they did before pandemic began and 39% of parents say they have become less strict about their rules to control their children\u2019s screen time]\nL108: \nL109: Compared with before the beginning of the coronavirus outbreak, 72% of parents with children in school say their children are spending more time in front of screens. By contrast, 7% of these parents say their children are spending less time in front of screens now, and 20% say they spend about the same amount of time as before the pandemic. \nL110: \nL111: For some, these pandemic realities played a role in new rules about screen time. Even as a majority of parents with children in grades K-12 say their children are spending more time in front of screens, a share of parents with children in school also say they have become less strict about screen time control. Some 39% of these parents say they have become less strict with their rules about the amount of time they allow their children to be in front of screens \u2013 aside from time they might spend on schoolwork \u2013 compared with before the beginning of the pandemic. A smaller share of parents with children in grades K-12 say they have become more strict (18%) with these rules. And 43% say their rules have stayed about the same.\nL112: \nL113: There is some variation in how parents with children in grades K-12 have changed their screen time rules based on where they live. Suburban parents (45%) are more likely than rural (34%) or urban parents (33%) to say they have become less strict about the amount of non-schoolwork time they allow their children to be in front of screens compared with before the pandemic. \nL114: \nL115:  \u301052\u2020Next: 3.

And those with lower and middle incomes are more likely than those with higher incomes to report this difficulty. \nL74: \nL75: Among broadband users, connection quality also plays a role in parents\u2019 experience in helping their children with online learning. \nL76: \nL77: Some 34% of parents who say they often or sometimes experience internet problems also say they have a relatively difficult time helping their children with technology and the internet for online instruction, compared with 22% of parents who never or rarely have internet problems. \nL78: \nL79: ### Parents with lower incomes more likely than parents with higher incomes to say their children had technology-related difficulties with schoolwork\nL80: \nL81: This survey, which follows up on findings reported near the beginning of the pandemic about the problems parents thought their children might face, shows that some parents report that their children have faced technology-related difficulties while completing school assignments since the coronavirus outbreak began.\nL82: \nL83: [Image 2: Parents with lower incomes more likely than parents with higher incomes to say their children have faced tech-related schoolwork challenges in the pandemic]\nL84: \nL85: The April 2021 survey shows that roughly a quarter (27%) of parents with children whose schools were closed at some point during the pandemic say their children had to do their schoolwork on a cellphone. Smaller shares of these parents say their children were unable to complete schoolwork because they did not have access to a computer at home (16%) or had to use public Wi\u2011Fi to finish their schoolwork because there was not a reliable internet connection at home (14%). And roughly a third (34%) of parents whose children\u2019s schools were closed at some point say their children encountered at least one of these three challenges in trying to complete their schoolwork. \nL86: \nL87: The shares among these parents with children whose schools closed at some point vary based on household income and show that parents with lower incomes were more likely to report their children had these tech-related problems. For instance, 25% of parents with lower incomes say their children with closed schools could not complete their schoolwork because of a lack of computer access. This share is 23 percentage points higher than for parents who have higher incomes (2%). Parents with lower incomes are also far more likely than those in the upper-income tier to say their children encountered at least one of these obstacles during the pandemic (46% vs. 18%). And 9% of these parents in lower-income households say their children experienced all three of these obstacles. \nL88: \nL89: In a survey near the beginning of the pandemic last year, the Center asked parents about whether they anticipated these problems for their children. In April 2020, 29% of parents with children whose schools were closed at that time said it was very or somewhat likely that in completing schoolwork at home during the coronavirus outbreak, their children would have to do their schoolwork on a cellphone. About one-in-five of the same set of parents said this about children having to use public Wi-Fi to finish their schoolwork because of a lack of a reliable internet connection at home or being unable to complete their schoolwork because they did not have access to a computer at home. And 38% of these parents said their children would be very or somewhat likely to encounter at least one of these tech-related obstacles for schoolwork.\nL90: \nL91: ### Growing share of adults say schools should provide technology to all students in order to complete schoolwork during the pandemic\nL92: \nL93: [Image 3: Roughly half of adults say schools have responsibility to provide technology to all students during pandemic]\nL94: \nL95: Since the pandemic began, public attitudes have shifted and become more supportive of the idea that schools have a responsibility to provide all students with laptop or tablet computers to help them complete schoolwork during the pandemic. \nL96: \nL97: The new survey finds that 49% of U.S. adults say that K-12 schools have a responsibility to provide all students with laptop or tablet computers in order to help them complete their schoolwork at home during the COVID-19 outbreak \u2013 a 12 percentage point increase from April 2020. At the same time, the share of Americans who say otherwise has decreased since last year. The portions who say schools only have a responsibility for students whose families cannot afford technology and that schools do not have this responsibility each fell by 6 points.\nL98: \nL99: While larger shares of both parties now say K-12 schools have a responsibility to provide computers to all students in order to help them complete schoolwork at home, there is a 15-point change among Republicans: 43% of Republicans now say K-12 schools have this responsibility, compared with 28% last April. In the new survey, 22% of Republicans also say schools do not have this responsibility at all, compared with 6% of Democrats. And Democrats are still more likely than Republicans to say K-12 schools have a responsibility to provide computers to all students to help them complete schoolwork at home.\nL100: \nL101: Adults with lower incomes are also more likely than those who have middle or higher incomes to say K-12 schools should provide technology to all students. And adults in lower-income households who say this have seen a 10-point increase since 2020.\nL102: \nL103: ### Majority of parents of K-12 children say their kids are spending more time in front of screens; 39% say they have become less strict about screen time\nL104: \nL105: As many parents settled at home and adjusted to online learning for their children, a majority observed changing screen time patterns for their children.\nL106: \nL107: [Image 4: Roughly seven-in-ten parents say their children are spending more time in front of screens than they did before pandemic began and 39% of parents say they have become less strict about their rules to control their children\u2019s screen time]\nL108: \nL109: Compared with before the beginning of the coronavirus outbreak, 72% of parents with children in school say their children are spending more time in front of screens. By contrast, 7% of these parents say their children are spending less time in front of screens now, and 20% say they spend about the same amount of time as before the pandemic. \nL110: \nL111: For some, these pandemic realities played a role in new rules about screen time. Even as a majority of parents with children in grades K-12 say their children are spending more time in front of screens, a share of parents with children in school also say they have become less strict about screen time control. Some 39% of these parents say they have become less strict with their rules about the amount of time they allow their children to be in front of screens \u2013 aside from time they might spend on schoolwork \u2013 compared with before the beginning of the pandemic. A smaller share of parents with children in grades K-12 say they have become more strict (18%) with these rules. And 43% say their rules have stayed about the same.\nL112: \nL113: There is some variation in how parents with children in grades K-12 have changed their screen time rules based on where they live. Suburban parents (45%) are more likely than rural (34%) or urban parents (33%) to say they have become less strict about the amount of non-schoolwork time they allow their children to be in front of screens compared with before the pandemic. \nL114: \nL115:  Next: 3.

Rather worryingly, however, the survey also found that 34% of parents lacked at least some degree of confidence in supporting their child\u2019s learning.\nL193: \nL194: Parents\u2019 anxieties over school closures and remote learning subsequently became big news. In January 2021, ITV News and the BBC\u2019s Panorama programme were among those citing what was then our most \u301069\u2020recent research finding\u2020www.parentkind.org.uk\u3011 \u2013 that a third of parents had told us that juggling home schooling with having to work from home themselves was proving challenging.\nL195: \nL196: However, when we came to conduct our \u301070\u2020February 2021 poll\u2020www.parentkind.org.uk\u3011 \u2013 which asked parents for details of any positives that had emerged from their children\u2019s experiences of remote learning during lockdown \u2013 we were delighted to find that almost two thirds stated being more aware of what their child was learning.\nL197: \nL198: 34% also expressed positive views regarding their school\u2019s use of technology, via innovations such digital parents evenings \u2013 with the result that there are now many parents who wish to retain such avenues for engaging with teachers into the future. \nL199: \nL200: Outside of their original pandemic-related purpose, such solutions can help tackle the barriers preventing some parents with a bad experience of education from setting foot in their children\u2019s school, while also saving time and effort for those with busy lives and competing commitments.\nL201: \nL202: ## Family learning anxieties allayed\nL203: \nL204: In that same February 2021 poll, just over a quarter indicated that they were more worried about the impact of the pandemic on their child\u2019s education than they had been in March 2020. A similar proportion felt roughly the same level of worry, but around 45% stated that they were now less worried.\nL205: \nL206: That may have been because their anxieties were allayed by the satisfaction they felt with their schools\u2019 remote learning provision, with 86% reporting being satisfied overall.\nL207: \nL208: Nearly a year into the pandemic, it could have due to their children becoming more settled into their new routines. More than half said they were coping better with their current learning arrangements compared to the first lockdown.\nL209: \nL210: Parents\u2019 confidence had increased, too. 79% now felt they could support their child\u2019s learning at home, up from 66% in May 2020. Overall, we saw a more positive picture of life at home start to emerge, after all that they\u2019d been through.\nL211: \nL212: ## A new appreciation for high-quality teaching\nL213: \nL214: At the time of writing, in June 2021, we have many reasons to feel positive about the future of parental participation in children\u2019s schooling. Many parents have been able develop a deeper knowledge of the productive role they themselves can play in their child\u2019s education. \nL215: \nL216: They have also acquired a new appreciation of the dedication shown by teachers, and overwhelmingly believe that staff and school leaders have done their utmost to keep their children\u2019s learning on track \u2013 difficult though it has been to return with no learning loss at all.\nL217: \nL218: The recent introduction of legislation requiring schools in England to consult parents on their RSE policies will be a useful bellwether. It will indicate how quickly and thoroughly schools can adjust to having parents become more deeply involved in those education conversations and the issues that affect them.\nL219: \nL220: We\u2019d like to see school leaders take this time \u2013 when there\u2019s a parent community out there that\u2019s keen on staying involved \u2013 to maximise their parental engagement strategy. The key to helping children reach their potential is having schools and homes working in close partnership.\nL221: \nL222: We\u2019ve tried it over this past year, and have seen vividly the great things that can be achieved by having parents and teachers working closely together and sharing mutual trust.\nL223: \nL224: At this crucial juncture, as we confront the difficult task of education recovery and ensuring our young people can catch up on their lost learning, it\u2019s more vital than ever that schools keep parents on board and ensure that two-way conversation keeps flowing.\nL225: \nL226: ## Involvement of parents \u2013 giving them a voice\nL227: \nL228: As a national charity, Parentkind gives those with a parenting role a voice in education.\nL229: \nL230: We invest substantial resources in representing parent views on their child\u2019s learning to local, regional and national governments and agencies, because evidence tells parental participation in education benefits all children in all schools and society as a whole. \nL231: \nL232: Parentkind is the largest network of PTA fundraisers in the UK. We bring specialist fundraising support and advice to parent volunteers so that every school can benefit from a successful PTA.

As Sangeetha logs in for her first virtual appointment with a parent of a child in her Year 6 class, she isn\u2019t sure what to expect. \nL89: \nL90: Since lockdown, moving to virtual meetings has not been the only change: getting involved in their children\u2019s schoolwork during recent periods of remote learning has helped many parents to understand more about what is being taught in schools. \nL91: \nL92: On the surface, this sounds positive. Having parents who are more engaged with - and informed about - learning can only be a good thing, right? \nL93: \nL94: Sangeetha isn\u2019t quite so sure. Parents have started to challenge her about her teaching methods and, as an early career teacher, she finds it difficult to answer their increasingly demanding questions.\nL95: \nL96: This higher level of parental involvement in the academic side of school is something she may have to get used to, though, because there are signs that the pandemic may have changed parent-school relationships for good.\nL97: \nL98: Parents knowing more about what happens in the classroom seemed, initially, to be a positive development for teachers. Back in January, when Gavin Williamson, who was education secretary at the time, announced that parents could report their child\u2019s school to Ofsted if they were unhappy with its remote learning offer, thousands did offer feedback - but it was overwhelmingly positive.\nL99: \nL100: \u201cParents have realised how difficult and complex teaching is, and how much it should be respected as a profession,\u201d says Lee Elliot Major, professor of social mobility at the University of Exeter.\nL101: \nL102: ## The impact of Covid on parent engagement in schools\nL103: \nL104: Fiona Forbes, co-founder of September For Schools, a parent action group founded during the pandemic, likewise says that she has noticed a shift in parents\u2019 attitudes. \nL105: \nL106: \u201cWe have all been through this shared experience and parents really appreciate what schools have done. They\u2019ve seen a more human side to both the school and the teachers themselves,\u201d she says. \nL107: \nL108: However, while some households have felt grateful for their children\u2019s teachers, others have lost trust as a result of lockdown, warns Ed Dorrell, a director at Public First, a policy, research, opinion and strategy consultancy.\nL109: \nL110: Throughout the pandemic, he has hosted dozens of focus groups with parents about their views on education, and has found that there is a split between primary parents and secondary parents. \nL111: \nL112: \u201cIn secondary schools, parents were very angry in the first lockdown about what they felt was an absence of secondary schools in their children\u2019s lives,\u201d Dorrell explains. \u201cThey do recognise that schools were up against it, but there was a sense that they weren\u2019t working as hard as they should be to get online learning up and running. \nL113: \nL114: \u201cBy the second lockdown, they recognised that things had changed, and it vastly improved. But there is a sense of slight disappointment, and some secondary schools have lost the trust of parents.\u201d\nL115: \nL116: Whether they are pleased with schools or not, many parents, he says, are interested in continuing their greater involvement in their child\u2019s education.\nL117: \nL118: \u201cThey are much more informed on how education actually works,\u201d Dorrell says. \u201cThey are thinking about how the learning process takes place, the way it\u2019s shaped, the way it\u2019s formed and, as a result, they are much more interested in what\u2019s going on in the classroom, what the teachers are teaching and how they\u2019re teaching it.\u201d\nL119: \nL120: Elliot Major - whose new book, The Good Parent Educator: what every parent should know about their children\u2019s education, has recently been published - agrees that increasing numbers of parents want more of a say. \u201cI suspect we will see a change in dynamic. Certainly, many will have far more demanding questions,\u201d he says. \nL121: \nL122: There have always been those parents who are more heavily engaged with schools, but we aren\u2019t talking about attending the school f\u00eate or helping out with the nativity here - we\u2019re referring to parents who are becoming more actively involved in the teaching and learning side of things. \nL123: \nL124: So, how big a change are we likely to see? Well, in terms of parents planning to continue increased levels of involvement in their children\u2019s schoolwork, it seems to be a mixed bag.\nL125: \nL126: In September 2021, YouGov surveyed more than 760 parents on behalf of the University of Exeter about their experiences of education during lockdown. When asked whether they planned to spend more time helping their child with education activities in the 2021-22 academic year, 30 per cent said they planned to spend between one and four extra hours a week on education activities, while 44 per cent that they would either spend no extra hours or that their child did not need to make up for missed education. Around 6 per cent said that they would spend between five and eight extra hours, 3 per cent said they would spend more than nine extra hours, and 17 per cent said they didn\u2019t know. \nL127: \nL128: What about parents\u2019 interaction with school? Again, the picture is mixed.\nL129: \nL130: David Dempster is the headteacher of Boroughmuir High School in Edinburgh. He has found that, while parents were really engaged with the school during lockdown, interest has dropped off a little now.\nL131: \nL132: During the lockdowns, the school\u2019s parent council ran regular online meetings, with a member of SLT always in attendance to answer any questions. There used to be more than 150 parents logging on, but since the start of this term it has been more usual for 40 to attend. \nL133: \nL134: \u201cParents had to take an interest in what their children were trying to learn at home. They needed to be a conduit between the kids and the curriculum. They certainly wanted to assist the school, but now that pupils are back in school and the teacher is there to manage things, by and large, I think parents are happy for that,\u201d he says. \u201cBut there\u2019s no doubt about it: many parents learned a lot about the curriculum and what their children are learning. And it\u2019s not just about what they\u2019re learning but how they learn, how lessons are structured, the way young people engage in learning.\u201d \nL135: \nL136: Rachael Philpot is a primary school teacher and head of Year 3. She says that, in her experience, parental engagement has been\nVisible: 3% - 33%",

But how long lasting will that change be and will the positives of the new dynamic outweigh the negatives?   \nL66: Kate Parker investigates\nL67: \nL68: 10th December 2021, 12:00am\nL69: \nL70: [Image 0: Has parents\u2019 relationship with school changed forever?] \nL71: \nL72: picture: Alamy\nL73: \nL74:  Kate Parker \nL75: \nL76: Share\nL77: \nL78: How the pandemic changed parental engagement\nL79: \nL80: https://www.tes.com/magazine/teaching-learning/general/how-pandemic-changed-parental-engagement \nL81: \nL82: Copy Link\nL83: \nL84:         \nL85: \nL86: To listen to an audio version of this article, click here.\nL87: \nL88: It\u2019s parents\u2019 evening again. As Sangeetha logs in for her first virtual appointment with a parent of a child in her Year 6 class, she isn\u2019t sure what to expect. \nL89: \nL90: Since lockdown, moving to virtual meetings has not been the only change: getting involved in their children\u2019s schoolwork during recent periods of remote learning has helped many parents to understand more about what is being taught in schools. \nL91: \nL92: On the surface, this sounds positive. Having parents who are more engaged with - and informed about - learning can only be a good thing, right? \nL93: \nL94: Sangeetha isn\u2019t quite so sure. Parents have started to challenge her about her teaching methods and, as an early career teacher, she finds it difficult to answer their increasingly demanding questions.\nL95: \nL96: This higher level of parental involvement in the academic side of school is something she may have to get used to, though, because there are signs that the pandemic may have changed parent-school relationships for good.\nL97: \nL98: Parents knowing more about what happens in the classroom seemed, initially, to be a positive development for teachers. Back in January, when Gavin Williamson, who was education secretary at the time, announced that parents could report their child\u2019s school to Ofsted if they were unhappy with its remote learning offer, thousands did offer feedback - but it was overwhelmingly positive.\nL99: \nL100: \u201cParents have realised how difficult and complex teaching is, and how much it should be respected as a profession,\u201d says Lee Elliot Major, professor of social mobility at the University of Exeter.\nL101: \nL102: ## The impact of Covid on parent engagement in schools\nL103: \nL104: Fiona Forbes, co-founder of September For Schools, a parent action group founded during the pandemic, likewise says that she has noticed a shift in parents\u2019 attitudes. \nL105: \nL106: \u201cWe have all been through this shared experience and parents really appreciate what schools have done. They\u2019ve seen a more human side to both the school and the teachers themselves,\u201d she says. \nL107: \nL108: However, while some households have felt grateful for their children\u2019s teachers, others have lost trust as a result of lockdown, warns Ed Dorrell, a director at Public First, a policy, research, opinion and strategy consultancy.\nL109: \nL110: Throughout the pandemic, he has hosted dozens of focus groups with parents about their views on education, and has found that there is a split between primary parents and secondary parents. \nL111: \nL112: \u201cIn secondary schools, parents were very angry in the first lockdown about what they felt was an absence of secondary schools in their children\u2019s lives,\u201d Dorrell explains. \u201cThey do recognise that schools were up against it, but there was a sense that they weren\u2019t working as hard as they should be to get online learning up and running. \nL113: \nL114: \u201cBy the second lockdown, they recognised that things had changed, and it vastly improved. But there is a sense of slight disappointment, and some secondary schools have lost the trust of parents.\u201d\nL115: \nL116: Whether they are pleased with schools or not, many parents, he says, are interested in continuing their greater involvement in their child\u2019s education.\nL117: \nL118: \u201cThey are much more informed on how education actually works,\u201d Dorrell says. \u201cThey are thinking about how the learning process takes place, the way it\u2019s shaped, the way it\u2019s formed and, as a result, they are much more interested in what\u2019s going on in the classroom, what the teachers are teaching and how they\u2019re teaching it.\u201d\nL119: \nL120: Elliot Major - whose new book, The Good Parent Educator: what every parent should know about their children\u2019s education, has recently been published - agrees that increasing numbers of parents want more of a say. \u201cI suspect we will see a change in dynamic. Certainly, many will have far more demanding questions,\u201d he says. \nL121: \nL122: There have always been those parents who are more heavily engaged with schools, but we aren\u2019t talking about attending the school f\u00eate or helping out with the nativity here - we\u2019re referring to parents who are becoming more actively involved in the teaching and learning side of things. \nL123: \nL124: So, how big a change are we likely to see? Well, in terms of parents planning to continue increased levels of involvement in their children\u2019s schoolwork, it seems to be a mixed bag.\nL125: \nL126: In September 2021, YouGov surveyed more than 760 parents on behalf of the University of Exeter about their experiences of education during lockdown. When asked whether they planned to spend more time helping their child with education activities in the 2021-22 academic year, 30 per cent said they planned to spend between one and four extra hours a week on education activities, while 44 per cent that they would either spend no extra hours or that their child did not need to make up for missed education. Around 6 per cent said that they would spend between five and eight extra hours, 3 per cent said they would spend more than nine extra hours, and 17 per cent said they didn\u2019t know. \nL127: \nL128: What about parents\u2019 interaction with school? Again, the picture is mixed.\nL129: \nL130: David Dempster is the headteacher of Boroughmuir High School in Edinburgh. He has found that, while parents were really engaged with the school during lockdown, interest has dropped off a little now.\nL131: \nL132: During the lockdowns, the school\u2019s parent council ran regular online meetings, with a member of SLT always in attendance to answer any questions. There used to be more than 150 parents logging on, but since the start of this term it has been more usual for 40 to attend. \nL133: \nL134: \u201cParents had to take an interest in what their children were trying to learn at home. They needed to be a conduit between the kids and the curriculum. They certainly wanted to assist the school, but now that pupils are back in school and the teacher is there to manage things, by and large, I think parents are happy for that,\u201d he says. \u201cBut there\u2019s no doubt about it: many parents learned a lot about the curriculum and what their children are learning. And it\u2019s not just about what they\u2019re learning but how they learn, how lessons are structured, the way young people engage in learning.\u201d \nL135: \nL136: Rachael Philpot is a primary school teacher and head of Year 3. She says that, in her experience, parental engagement has been\nVisible: 3% - 33%",

                            "The COVID-19 pandemic and the shift to remote learning had a significant impact on parental engagement with schools and their children's education. Parents, having to assist their children with schoolwork at home, became more involved and informed about the content and methods of teaching. This increased involvement led to a mix of reactions:\n\n1. **Challenges for Teachers**: Teachers, like Sangeetha, found themselves facing increased scrutiny and challenging questions from parents about their teaching methods\u301075\u2020source\u3011.\n\n2. **Parental Realization of Teaching Complexities**: Many parents realized the complexity and difficulty of teaching, leading to a newfound respect for the profession\u301076\u2020source\u3011.\n\n3. **Loss of Trust in Some Cases**: Ed Dorrell, from Public First, observed that while some parents grew appreciative of teachers' efforts, others lost trust, especially during the initial stages of lockdown when they felt an absence of support from schools for their children's education\u301077\u2020source\u3011.\n\n4. **Continued Parental Involvement**: Post-lockdown, many parents expressed a desire to remain more involved in their children's education, having gained a deeper understanding of the educational process\u301078\u2020source\u3011.\n\n5. **Shift in Parent-School Dynamic**: According to Elliot Major, this period marked a change in the dynamic between parents and schools, with parents becoming more actively involved in the teaching and learning side of education\u301079\u2020source\u3011.\n\n6. **Understanding of the Curriculum**: Parents gained insight into the curriculum and the learning process, which changed their approach to assisting the school and understanding what their children were learning\u301080\u2020source\u3011.\n\nWhile these findings do not directly address the claim about the movement to change curriculum in public schools to an ultra-Christian National-based curriculum, they do highlight the increased parental involvement and awareness of school curriculum content, which could influence public opinion and actions regarding school curricula. This increased involvement, particularly if guided by specific beliefs or agendas, could potentially lead to advocacy for changes in school curricula, including movements towards specific ideological or religious perspectives."

But there is a sense of slight disappointment, and some secondary schools have lost the trust of parents.\u201d",

                            "Yes, there are valid criticisms of the i-Ready reading assessment system. Critics often focus on the following aspects:\n\n1. **Accuracy and Appropriateness**: Some educators and experts argue that i-Ready may not always accurately assess a student's reading ability. Questions about the appropriateness of the content for certain grade levels have been raised.\n\n2. **Overemphasis on Testing**: There's a concern that i-Ready, like many standardized tests, can lead to an overemphasis on testing and test preparation in the classroom, potentially at the expense of other important aspects of learning and teaching.\n\n3. **Data Privacy and Security**: As with many digital platforms, there are concerns about student data privacy and security. Users of i-Ready provide personal and educational information, which raises questions about how this data is used and protected.\n\n4. **Cost and Resource Allocation**: Implementing i-Ready in schools requires financial investment. Critics argue that these funds could potentially be better used for other educational resources or direct instruction.\n\n5. **One-Size-Fits-All Approach**: Some educators argue that i-Ready, like many standardized assessment tools, adopts a one-size-fits-all approach that may not effectively cater to the diverse learning needs and styles of all students.\n\n6. **Impact on Student Motivation and Stress**: There is a concern that constant monitoring and assessment can lead to increased stress and pressure for students, and potentially negatively impact their motivation and attitude towards learning.\n\n7. **Teacher Autonomy**: The use of standardized assessment tools like i-Ready can sometimes be seen as undermining teacher autonomy and professional judgment, limiting their ability to tailor instruction to the specific needs of their students.\n\nThese criticisms highlight the ongoing debate about the role and effectiveness of standardized assessment tools in education."

                            "Yes, there is evidence supporting the accuracy of the i-Ready reading assessment system, which comes from research studies and reports. Key points include:\n\n1. **Alignment with Standards**: i-Ready is designed to align with state and national standards for reading, which is a critical factor in its accuracy and relevance in educational settings.\n\n2. **Research-Based Design**: The system is developed based on educational research and theory. This foundation helps in accurately assessing reading skills and providing appropriate instructional recommendations.\n\n3. **Adaptive Testing**: i-Ready uses adaptive testing methods, which means the difficulty of questions adjusts based on the student's responses. This approach is generally considered effective in accurately gauging a student's skill level.\n\n4. **Validation Studies**: There have been validation studies conducted by independent researchers and organizations that suggest i-Ready accurately assesses student reading levels and can predict performance on state tests.\n\n5. **Data-Driven Instruction**: i-Ready provides data that teachers can use to tailor instruction to individual student needs. This targeted approach is often effective in addressing specific learning gaps.\n\n6. **Continuous Improvement**: The system undergoes regular updates and improvements based on user feedback and new research, which helps maintain its relevance and accuracy.\n\nIt's important to note, however, that while there is evidence supporting the accuracy of i-Ready, the effectiveness of any educational tool can vary based on implementation, the specific educational context, and individual student needs. As with any assessment tool, it's most effective when used as part of a comprehensive approach to education that includes teacher judgment and a variety of instructional methods."

                            ";can you summarize this so its easy to undersand\n\n\n\nAt nu3, we know healthy and sustainable living is a key concern for many, with the environmental impacts of our eating habits at the forefront of discussion. To further the debate, we've undertaken a study which looks into the food industry's carbon footprint, directly comparing different diets in terms of carbon dioxide emissions. The research, which reveals the annual CO2 emissions per person for 130 nations worldwide, shows which countries could significantly reduce their carbon footprint by switching to a plant-based diet, as well as which food types generate the highest carbon dioxide emissions.\n\nThe study analyzes data from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) to determine the quantity of produce supplied for consumption of 11 food types for all countries researched. Using CO2 emissions data, the carbon footprint per capita is then calculated for each food type. This allows a direct comparison of the CO2 produced for each food type, as well as between seven animal products and four non-animal products. Finally, to determine the index's final ranking, the difference between the total CO2 produced by the amount of animal product eaten by a person in one country versus the total of non-animal product was calculated. This number reveals the difference in kgs CO2 emitted by animal product vs. non-animal product. The result is a balance that serves as an indicator for the carbon footprint saving potential per citizen per year if they switch from an animal to a non-animal diet."

This term applies because the system was implemented without prior testing to ascertain its effectiveness or safety. The presence of significant problems post-implementation and the inventor's insistence on its efficacy, despite evidence to the contrary, also suggests elements of \"confirmation bias,\" where the inventor may be favoring information that confirms their preconceptions about the system's effectiveness.\n\nAdditionally, the system could be characterized as being designed with a \"form over function\" approach. This means that its design prioritizes aspects that facilitate reporting or administrative convenience over actual effectiveness in addressing behavioral issues in children. This approach can compromise the system's effectiveness and may not serve the intended purpose adequately. \n\nIn a broader context, such systems might also be referred to as \"pseudo-scientific\" if they lack a basis in scientific evidence and do not adhere to the rigorous methods typical of scientific research and validation."

Here are key practices to consider and some that might be less essential:\n\n### Essential Data Collection Practices\n\n1. **Baseline Data Collection**: Before implementing the program, collect baseline data on student behaviors, academic performance, and other relevant metrics. This data will serve as a comparison point to evaluate the impact of the program.\n\n2. **Regular Monitoring**: Implement regular monitoring of key indicators related to student behavior and program objectives. This could include frequency and types of behavioral incidents, attendance records, academic performance, and feedback from teachers and students.\n\n3. **Qualitative and Quantitative Data**: Collect both qualitative data (like interviews, focus groups, and observations) and quantitative data (like surveys and behavioral incident reports). This comprehensive approach provides a more complete picture of the program's effectiveness.\n\n4. **Student Progress Tracking**: Track individual student progress over time. This helps in understanding how different students respond to the program and identifies areas needing additional support.\n\n5. **Feedback from Stakeholders**: Regularly gather feedback from teachers, parents, and students about the program. This feedback is crucial for understanding the program\u2019s practical impact and areas for improvement.\n\n### Less Essential Data Collection Practices\n\n1. **Excessive Paperwork**: While documentation is important, overly burdensome paperwork can detract from the primary focus of the program and may not significantly contribute to understanding its effectiveness.\n\n2. **Overly Frequent Surveys**: While surveys are valuable, too frequent surveys can lead to survey fatigue among participants, potentially reducing the quality and reliability of the data collected.\n\n3. **Non-Targeted Data Collection**: Collecting data that does not directly relate to the objectives of the program can be resource-intensive without adding significant value to the evaluation process.\n\n4. **Singular Data Points**: Relying on one type of data or singular data points can lead to a skewed understanding of the program\u2019s impact. It's important to look at a range of indicators.\n\n### General Considerations\n\n- Ensure data collection methods are ethical and protect the privacy and confidentiality of students.\n- Use data collection tools that are reliable and valid for the population and objectives.\n- Be adaptable and willing to modify data collection methods based on the evolving needs of the program and feedback from stakeholders.\n\nIn summary, focus on collecting data that directly informs the program\u2019s objectives, is practical to gather, and provides insights into both the overall impact and individual experiences within the program. Avoid methods that are overly burdensome, irrelevant, or provide limited additional insight."

Here are some approaches you can suggest:\n\n### 1. Simple Pre- and Post-Implementation Surveys\n- **Design**: Create short, easy-to-understand surveys to be filled out by teachers, students, and parents before and after the program implementation.\n- **Focus**: Ask questions related to the key objectives of your program, such as changes in student behavior, classroom atmosphere, and student engagement.\n- **Analysis**: Compare the responses from before and after the implementation to gauge changes and impacts.\n\n### 2. Behavior Incident Logs\n- **Design**: Implement a simple logging system where teachers can record behavioral incidents.\n- **Focus**: Track frequency, type, and context of incidents.\n- **Analysis**: Analyze trends over time to see if there's a decrease in incidents or changes in the types of incidents reported.\n\n### 3. Attendance and Academic Performance Tracking\n- **Design**: Use existing school data systems to track changes in student attendance and academic performance.\n- **Analysis**: Look for trends or changes that correlate with the implementation of your program.\n\n### 4. Regular Feedback Sessions\n- **Design**: Schedule brief, regular meetings with staff involved in the program to gather verbal feedback.\n- **Focus**: Discuss what\u2019s working, what\u2019s not, and any suggestions for improvement.\n- **Documentation**: Keep concise notes from each session to track recurring themes or new insights.\n\n### 5. Visual Data Representation\n- **Approach**: Use simple graphing tools (like Excel or Google Sheets) to create visual representations of your data.\n- **Benefit**: Visuals can make data more accessible and easier to understand, highlighting trends and changes effectively.\n\n### 6. Focus Groups or Interviews\n- **Design**: Conduct short focus groups or interviews with a small group of students, teachers, or parents.\n- **Focus**: Dive deeper into personal experiences and perceptions of the program.\n- **Analysis**: Identify common themes or notable insights that might not be captured through quantitative data.\n\n### Emphasizing the Importance\n- **Practical Examples**: Show real examples of how data led to improvements in similar programs.\n- **Relate to Objectives**: Demonstrate how data collection directly relates to achieving the program\u2019s goals.\n- **Continuous Improvement**: Emphasize that data helps in continuously improving the program, making it more effective over time.\n- **Stakeholder Engagement**: Highlight how data collection and analysis can make the voices of all stakeholders (students, parents, teachers) part of the decision-making process.\n\nImplementing these practices can foster a culture of evidence-based decision-making in your team, highlighting the importance of data in understanding and improving your program's effectiveness."

                            "To clean the Ninja Foodi XL Oven, including the engaged fan, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Unplug the Oven**: Always start by unplugging the appliance for safety.\n\n2. **Cool Down**: Ensure the oven is completely cooled before cleaning.\n\n3. **Removable Parts**: Take out any removable parts such as the crumb tray, wire rack, air fry basket, and others. Wash these separately in warm soapy water, rinse, and dry.\n\n4. **Interior Cleaning**: Wipe the inside of the oven with a damp cloth. If there are tough stains, use a mild detergent. Avoid harsh chemicals or abrasive materials, as they can damage the interior.\n\n5. **Cleaning the Heating Elements**: Be careful not to touch the heating elements. Gently wipe any crumbs or debris off the elements with a soft cloth. Never use water or liquids on the heating elements.\n\n6. **Fan Area**: The fan area might be trickier to clean. Use a soft brush or a cloth to gently remove any debris. Avoid pushing dirt further into the fan mechanism. If the fan is not easily accessible for cleaning, consult the user manual for specific guidance.\n\n7. **Exterior Cleaning**: Wipe the outside of the oven with a damp cloth. You can use a mild detergent if needed. Dry it with a clean towel.\n\n8. **Avoid Water Ingress**: Be careful not to let water get into the electrical components of the oven, including the fan area.\n\n9. **Reassemble**: Once everything is clean and dry, reassemble all the parts.\n\nAlways refer to the user manual for specific instructions related to your Ninja Foodi XL Oven model, as some models may have different cleaning requirements or tips for maintaining the appliance. Regular cleaning will not only ensure better cooking results but also prolong the life of your oven."

                            "Using steam to clean the Ninja Foodi XL Oven can be effective for loosening grease and food residues, especially in hard-to-reach areas. Here\u2019s how you can do it:\n\n1. **Prepare a Water and Vinegar Solution**: Mix a cup of water with a couple of tablespoons of vinegar in an oven-safe dish. Vinegar is a natural cleaning agent that can help loosen residues.\n\n2. **Place the Dish in the Oven**: Put the dish on the rack in the oven.\n\n3. **Heat the Oven**: Set the oven to a low temperature, around 250\u00b0F (120\u00b0C), and let it run for about 10-15 minutes. The steam created by the heated water-vinegar mixture will help loosen grime.\n\n4. **Turn Off and Cool**: After the time is up, turn off the oven and allow it to cool down slightly. Be careful of hot steam when you open the door.\n\n5. **Wipe Down**: Once the oven is cool enough to touch but still warm, use a damp"

                            "Yes, you can file a lawsuit in small claims court in Colorado without a lawyer. Small claims court is designed for individuals to represent themselves, making it easier and less costly to resolve disputes involving relatively small amounts of money. Here are some key points to consider for your scenario:\n\n1. **Filing a Lawsuit**: You can file a claim in the county where the defendant lives or where the incident occurred. The process usually involves filling out a form and paying a filing fee.\n\n2. **Evidence and Preparation**: It's crucial to gather all relevant evidence to support your claim. This might include contracts, receipts, emails, photographs, or any other documents that can substantiate your case.\n\n3. **Settlement Before Court**: You can propose a settlement to the defendant before the court date. In your proposal, you can suggest that they pay a portion of the claim to avoid the lawsuit. It's up to them to accept or reject this offer.\n\n4. **Court Proceedings**: If the case goes to court, both parties will have the opportunity to present their evidence and arguments. The judge will then make a decision based on the evidence presented.\n\n5. **No Lawyers Needed**: In small claims court, parties typically represent themselves, though you may want to consult with a lawyer for advice before proceeding.\n\nRemember, the maximum claim amount in Colorado's small claims court is $7,500. If your claim exceeds this amount, you would need to pursue a different legal avenue, possibly requiring legal representation."

                            "In a case involving allegations of a violation of the Habitability Act and resulting health issues and emotional distress, small claims court might not be the most suitable venue. Here's why:\n\n1. **Complexity of the Case**: Small claims court is generally intended for straightforward disputes over small amounts of money. Cases involving violations of specific acts, along with claims of emotional distress and health issues, can be more complex and may require more detailed legal arguments and evidence.\n\n2. **Types of Damages**: Small claims courts typically handle cases seeking monetary compensation for actual losses (like unpaid rent or property damage). Claims for emotional distress and potential health damages often require more detailed proof and may not be as straightforward to quantify.\n\n3. **Legal Representation**: Given the complexity and seriousness of your case, it might be beneficial to consult with a lawyer. A lawyer can provide advice on the best course of action, help quantify damages, and guide you through the legal process.\n\n4. **Habitability Act Violations**: These types of violations can involve specific legal requirements and standards. A lawyer with experience in landlord-tenant law would be able to advise on the strength of your case and the potential outcomes.\n\n5. **Evidence and Documentation**: For any legal action, it's crucial to gather and preserve all relevant evidence, such as medical records, communications with the landlord, photographs of the conditions that violated the Habitability Act, and any other documentation that supports your claim.\n\nWhile you can still choose to proceed in small claims court, be aware that the nature of your claims might exceed the scope of what is typically handled in this venue. A consultation with a legal professional can provide clarity on the best path forward given the specifics of your situation."

                            "Your strategy to leverage the potential for a public court case to encourage a settlement could be effective, especially if the opposing party is motivated to avoid public scrutiny. Here are some considerations for your approach:\n\n1. **Initial Communication**: You might start by clearly communicating to the other party your intention to take the matter to small claims court if a settlement isn\u2019t reached. Emphasize your readiness to present your evidence publicly.\n\n2. **Settlement Offer**: Make a clear settlement offer. This should be a specific monetary amount that you believe compensates for your damages and is within the small claims court limit of $7,500.\n\n3. **Documentation and Evidence**: Ensure that your evidence is well-organized and compelling. This could include documentation of the habitability issues, any medical records or bills related to health issues you've experienced, and any communication with the landlord.\n\n4. **Leveraging Privacy Concerns**: If you believe that the landlord wants to avoid public exposure, highlight the benefits of a quick, private settlement compared to a public court proceeding.\n\n5. **Understand the Risks**: Be aware that there's no guarantee they will respond to your approach as you expect. They might still choose to go to court, or they might not perceive the risk of public exposure as significant as you believe.\n\n6. **Legal Consultation**: Even if you plan to represent yourself, it might be worthwhile to consult a lawyer for advice on your strategy and the strength of your evidence. Some lawyers offer free initial consultations or work on a contingency basis.\n\n7. **Court Preparation**: If your case does go to court, be prepared to present your evidence clearly and concisely. The judge will base their decision on the facts and evidence presented.\n\nRemember, the effectiveness of your strategy will depend on how the other party perceives the risks and costs of public exposure versus a private settlement. Stay focused on the strengths of your case and the evidence at your disposal."

                            "The cost of hiring a lawyer varies widely depending on the complexity of the case, the lawyer's experience, and the geographic location. For cases like yours, which involve potential violations of the Habitability Act and claims for health issues and emotional distress, here are some general points regarding legal fees:\n\n1. **Hourly Rates**: Lawyers often charge an hourly rate. This can range from $100 to $400 or more per hour, depending on the lawyer's experience and the location. Some lawyers might have a lower rate for small claims cases or offer a sliding scale based on your income.\n\n2. **Flat Fees**: Some lawyers might offer a flat fee for handling a small claims case. This can be a more predictable option, but it's less common for cases that could become complex.\n\n3. **Contingency Fees**: These are more common in cases where there's a significant amount of money at stake, like personal injury lawsuits. Lawyers working on contingency get paid a percentage of the settlement or award, typically 25% to 40%. However, contingency arrangements are less common in small claims cases due to the lower financial stakes.\n\n4. **Consultation Fees**: Some lawyers charge for initial consultations, while others offer this for free. It's always a good idea to ask about consultation fees upfront.\n\n5. **Retainer Fees**: A retainer is an upfront cost that essentially acts as a down payment on future legal services. The lawyer then bills against this retainer at their hourly rate.\n\nGiven your willingness to pay some money upfront, you might find a lawyer who will work with you on either an hourly basis or for a flat fee. It's important to discuss all fees and payment structures during your initial consultation, ensuring you understand what financial obligations you may be taking on.\n\nRemember, legal costs can add up quickly, so it's crucial to have a clear understanding of your lawyer's fee structure and to weigh the potential costs against the benefits of legal representation in your specific case."

Bill Gates served as the CEO of Microsoft until 2000 and later as Chairman and Chief Software Architect until his retirement in 2008, while Paul Allen left the company in 1983 but remained on the board of directors until 2000.\nL183: \nL184: Note\nL185: \nL186: The following parameters aren't available with the new GPT-35-Turbo and GPT-4 models: `logprobs`, `best_of`, and `echo`. If you set any of these parameters, you'll get an error.\nL187: \nL188: Every response includes a `finish_reason`. The possible values for `finish_reason` are:\nL189: \nL190:   * stop: API returned complete model output.\nL191:   * length: Incomplete model output due to max_tokens parameter or token limit.\nL192:   * content_filter: Omitted content due to a flag from our content filters.\nL193:   * null:API response still in progress or incomplete.\nL194: \nL195: Consider setting `max_tokens` to a slightly higher value than normal such as 300 or 500.

When creating a \u30109\u2020deployment\u3011 of these models, you'll also need to specify a model version.\nL204: \nL205: You can find the model retirement dates for these models on our \u301010\u2020models\u3011 page.\nL206: \nL207: ## Working with the Chat Completion API\nL208: \nL209: OpenAI trained the GPT-35-Turbo and GPT-4 models to accept input formatted as a conversation. The messages parameter takes an array of message objects with a conversation organized by role. When using the Python API a list of dictionaries is used.\nL210: \nL211: The format of a basic Chat Completion is as follows:\nL212: \nL213:     {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"Provide some context and/or instructions to the model\"},\nL214:     {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"The users messages goes here\"}\nL215: \nL216: A conversation with one example answer followed by a question would look like:\nL217: \nL218:     {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"Provide some context and/or instructions to the model.\"},\nL219:     {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Example question goes here.\"},\nL220:     {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"Example answer goes here.\"},\nL221:     {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"First question/message for the model to actually respond to.\"}\nL222: \nL223: ### System role\nL224: \nL225: The system role also known as the system message is included at the beginning of the array. This message provides the initial instructions to the model. You can provide various information in the system role including:\nL226: \nL227:   * A brief description of the assistant\nL228:   * Personality traits of the assistant\nL229:   * Instructions or rules you would like the assistant to follow\nL230:   * Data or information needed for the model, such as relevant questions from an FAQ\nL231: \nL232: You can customize the system role for your use case or just include basic instructions. The system role/message is optional, but it's recommended to at least include a basic one to get the best results.\nL233: \nL234: ### Messages\nL235: \nL236: After the system role, you can include a series of messages between the user and the assistant.\nL237: \nL238:      {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"What is thermodynamics?\"}\nL239: \nL240: To trigger a response from the model, you should end with a user message indicating that it's the assistant's turn to respond. You can also include a series of example messages between the user and the assistant as a way to do few shot learning.\nL241: \nL242: ### Message prompt examples\nL243: \nL244: The following section shows examples of different styles of prompts that you could use with the GPT-35-Turbo and GPT-4 models. These examples are just a starting point, and you can experiment with different prompts to customize the behavior for your own use cases.\nL245: \nL246: #### Basic example\nL247: \nL248: If you want the GPT-35-Turbo model to behave similarly to \u301011\u2020chat.openai.com\u2020chat.openai.com\u3011, you can use a basic system message like \"Assistant is a large language model trained by OpenAI.\"\nL249: \nL250:     {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"Assistant is a large language model trained by OpenAI.\"},\nL251:     {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Who were the founders of Microsoft?\"}\nL252: \nL253: #### Example with instructions\nL254: \nL255: For some scenarios, you might want to give additional instructions to the model to define guardrails for what the model is able to do.\nL256: \nL257:     {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"Assistant is an intelligent chatbot designed to help users answer their tax related questions.\nL258:     Instructions: \nL259:     - Only answer questions related to taxes. \nL260:     - If you're unsure of an answer, you can say \"I don't know\" or \"I'm not sure\" and recommend users go to the IRS website for more information. \"},\nL261:     {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"When are my taxes due?\"}\nL262: \nL263: #### Using data for grounding\nL264: \nL265: You can also include relevant data or information in the system message to give the model extra context for the conversation. If you only need to include a small amount of information, you can hard code it in the system message. If you have a large amount of data that the model should be aware of, you can use \u301012\u2020embeddings\u3011 or a product like \u301013\u2020Azure Cognitive Search\u2020techcommunity.microsoft.com\u3011 to retrieve the most relevant information at query time.\nL266: \nL267:     {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"Assistant is an intelligent chatbot designed to help users answer technical questions about Azure OpenAI Serivce.

Bill Gates served as the CEO of Microsoft until 2000 and later as Chairman and Chief Software Architect until his retirement in 2008, while Paul Allen left the company in 1983 but remained on the board of directors until 2000.\nL183: \nL184: Note\nL185: \nL186: The following parameters aren't available with the new GPT-35-Turbo and GPT-4 models: `logprobs`, `best_of`, and `echo`. If you set any of these parameters, you'll get an error.\nL187: \nL188: Every response includes a `finish_reason`. The possible values for `finish_reason` are:\nL189: \nL190:   * stop: API returned complete model output.\nL191:   * length: Incomplete model output due to max_tokens parameter or token limit.\nL192:   * content_filter: Omitted content due to a flag from our content filters.\nL193:   * null:API response still in progress or incomplete.\nL194: \nL195: Consider setting `max_tokens` to a slightly higher value than normal such as 300 or 500.

When creating a \u30109\u2020deployment\u3011 of these models, you'll also need to specify a model version.\nL204: \nL205: You can find the model retirement dates for these models on our \u301010\u2020models\u3011 page.\nL206: \nL207: ## Working with the Chat Completion API\nL208: \nL209: OpenAI trained the GPT-35-Turbo and GPT-4 models to accept input formatted as a conversation. The messages parameter takes an array of message objects with a conversation organized by role. When using the Python API a list of dictionaries is used.\nL210: \nL211: The format of a basic Chat Completion is as follows:\nL212: \nL213:     {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"Provide some context and/or instructions to the model\"},\nL214:     {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"The users messages goes here\"}\nL215: \nL216: A conversation with one example answer followed by a question would look like:\nL217: \nL218:     {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"Provide some context and/or instructions to the model.\"},\nL219:     {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Example question goes here.\"},\nL220:     {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"Example answer goes here.\"},\nL221:     {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"First question/message for the model to actually respond to.\"}\nL222: \nL223: ### System role\nL224: \nL225: The system role also known as the system message is included at the beginning of the array. This message provides the initial instructions to the model. You can provide various information in the system role including:\nL226: \nL227:   * A brief description of the assistant\nL228:   * Personality traits of the assistant\nL229:   * Instructions or rules you would like the assistant to follow\nL230:   * Data or information needed for the model, such as relevant questions from an FAQ\nL231: \nL232: You can customize the system role for your use case or just include basic instructions. The system role/message is optional, but it's recommended to at least include a basic one to get the best results.\nL233: \nL234: ### Messages\nL235: \nL236: After the system role, you can include a series of messages between the user and the assistant.\nL237: \nL238:      {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"What is thermodynamics?\"}\nL239: \nL240: To trigger a response from the model, you should end with a user message indicating that it's the assistant's turn to respond. You can also include a series of example messages between the user and the assistant as a way to do few shot learning.\nL241: \nL242: ### Message prompt examples\nL243: \nL244: The following section shows examples of different styles of prompts that you could use with the GPT-35-Turbo and GPT-4 models. These examples are just a starting point, and you can experiment with different prompts to customize the behavior for your own use cases.\nL245: \nL246: #### Basic example\nL247: \nL248: If you want the GPT-35-Turbo model to behave similarly to \u301011\u2020chat.openai.com\u2020chat.openai.com\u3011, you can use a basic system message like \"Assistant is a large language model trained by OpenAI.\"\nL249: \nL250:     {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"Assistant is a large language model trained by OpenAI.\"},\nL251:     {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Who were the founders of Microsoft?\"}\nL252: \nL253: #### Example with instructions\nL254: \nL255: For some scenarios, you might want to give additional instructions to the model to define guardrails for what the model is able to do.\nL256: \nL257:     {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"Assistant is an intelligent chatbot designed to help users answer their tax related questions.\nL258:     Instructions: \nL259:     - Only answer questions related to taxes. \nL260:     - If you're unsure of an answer, you can say \"I don't know\" or \"I'm not sure\" and recommend users go to the IRS website for more information. \"},\nL261:     {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"When are my taxes due?\"}\nL262: \nL263: #### Using data for grounding\nL264: \nL265: You can also include relevant data or information in the system message to give the model extra context for the conversation. If you only need to include a small amount of information, you can hard code it in the system message. If you have a large amount of data that the model should be aware of, you can use \u301012\u2020embeddings\u3011 or a product like \u301013\u2020Azure Cognitive Search\u2020techcommunity.microsoft.com\u3011 to retrieve the most relevant information at query time.\nL266: \nL267:     {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"Assistant is an intelligent chatbot designed to help users answer technical questions about Azure OpenAI Serivce.

This example shows you how to create a conversation loop that performs the following actions:\nL305: \nL306:   * Continuously takes console input, and properly formats it as part of the messages list as user role content.\nL307:   * Outputs responses that are printed to the console and formatted and added to the messages list as assistant role content.\nL308: \nL309: This means that every time a new question is asked, a running transcript of the conversation so far is sent along with the latest question. Since the model has no memory, you need to send an updated transcript with each new question or the model will lose context of the previous questions and answers.\nL310: \nL311:   * \u301014\u2020OpenAI Python 0.28.1\u3011 \nL312:   * \u301015\u2020OpenAI Python 1.x\u3011 \nL313: \nL314:     import os\nL315:     import openai\nL316:     openai.api_type = \"azure\"\nL317:     openai.api_version = \"2023-05-15\" \nL318:     openai.api_base = os.getenv(\"AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT\")  # Your Azure OpenAI resource's endpoint value.\nL319:     openai.api_key = os.getenv(\"AZURE_OPENAI_KEY\")\nL320: \nL321:     conversation=[{\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are a helpful assistant.\"}]\nL322: \nL323:     while True:\nL324:         user_input = input()      \nL325:         conversation.append({\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": user_input})\nL326: \nL327:         response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(\nL328:             engine=\"gpt-35-turbo\", # The deployment name you chose when you deployed the GPT-35-turbo or GPT-4 model.\nL329:             messages=conversation\nL330:         )\nL331: \nL332:         conversation.append({\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": response[\"choices\"][0][\"message\"][\"content\"]})\nL333:         print(\"\\n\" + response['choices'][0]['message']['content'] + \"\\n\")\nL334: \nL335:     import os\nL336:     from openai import AzureOpenAI\nL337: \nL338:     client = AzureOpenAI(\nL339:       api_key = os.getenv(\"AZURE_OPENAI_KEY\"),  \nL340:       api_version = \"2023-05-15\",\nL341:       azure_endpoint = os.getenv(\"AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT\")  # Your Azure OpenAI resource's endpoint value.\nL342:     )\nL343: \nL344:     conversation=[{\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are a helpful assistant.\"}]\nL345: \nL346:     while True:\nL347:         user_input = input(\"Q:\")      \nL348:         conversation.append({\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": user_input})\nL349: \nL350:         response = client.chat.completions.create(\nL351:             model=\"gpt-35-turbo\", # model = \"deployment_name\".\nL352:             messages=conversation\nL353:         )\nL354: \nL355:         conversation.append({\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": response.choices[0].message.content})\nL356:         print(\"\\n\" + response.choices[0].message.content + \"\\n\")\nL357: \nL358: When you run the code above you will get a blank console window. Enter your first question in the window and then hit enter. Once the response is returned, you can repeat the process and keep asking questions.\nL359: \nL360: ## Managing conversations\nL361: \nL362: The previous example will run until you hit the model's token limit. With each question asked, and answer received, the `messages` list grows in size. The token limit for `gpt-35-turbo` is 4096 tokens, whereas the token limits for `gpt-4` and `gpt-4-32k` are 8192 and 32768 respectively. These limits include the token count from both the message list sent and the model response. The number of tokens in the messages list combined with the value of the `max_tokens` parameter must stay under these limits or you'll receive an error.\nL363: \nL364: It's your responsibility to ensure the prompt and completion falls within the token limit. This means that for longer conversations, you need to keep track of the token count and only send the model a prompt that falls within the limit.\nL365: \nL366: Note\nL367: \nL368: We strongly recommend staying within the \u301010\u2020documented input token limit\u3011 for all models even if you find you are able to exceed that limit.\nL369: \nL370: The following code sample shows a simple chat loop example with a technique for handling a 4096 token count using OpenAI's tiktoken library.\nL371: \nL372: The code uses tiktoken `0.5.1`. If you have an older version run `pip install tiktoken --upgrade`.\nL373: \nL374:   * \u301016\u2020OpenAI Python 0.28.1\u3011 \nL375:   * \u301017\u2020OpenAI Python 1.x\u3011 \nL376: \nL377:     import tiktoken\nL378:     import openai\nL379:     import os\nL380: \nL381:     openai.api_type = \"azure\"\nL382:     openai.api_version = \"2023-05-15\" \nL383:     openai.api_base = os.getenv(\"AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT\")  # Your Azure OpenAI resource's endpoint value.\nL384:     openai.api_key = os.getenv(\"AZURE_OPENAI_KEY\")\nL385: \nL386:     system_message = {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are a helpful assistant.\"}\nL387:     max_response_tokens = 250\nL388:     token_limit = 4096\nL389:     conversation = []\nL390:     conversation.append(system_message)\nL391: \nL392:     def num_tokens_from_messages(messages, model=\"gpt-3.5-turbo-0613\"):\nL393:         \"\"\"Return the number of tokens used by a list of messages.\"\"\"\nL394:         try:\nL395:             encoding = tiktoken.encoding_for_model(model)\nL396:         except KeyError:\nL397:             print(\"Warning: model not found.

They established the company on April 4, 1975. Bill Gates served as the CEO of Microsoft until 2000 and later as Chairman and Chief Software Architect until his retirement in 2008, while Paul Allen left the company in 1983 but remained on the board of directors until 2000.\nL183: \nL184: Note\nL185: \nL186: The following parameters aren't available with the new GPT-35-Turbo and GPT-4 models: `logprobs`, `best_of`, and `echo`. If you set any of these parameters, you'll get an error.\nL187: \nL188: Every response includes a `finish_reason`. The possible values for `finish_reason` are:\nL189: \nL190:   * stop: API returned complete model output.\nL191:   * length: Incomplete model output due to max_tokens parameter or token limit.\nL192:   * content_filter: Omitted content due to a flag from our content filters.\nL193:   * null:API response still in progress or incomplete.\nL194: \nL195: Consider setting `max_tokens` to a slightly higher value than normal such as 300 or 500. This ensures that the model doesn't stop generating text before it reaches the end of the message.\nL196: \nL197: ## Model versioning\nL198: \nL199: Note\nL200: \nL201: `gpt-35-turbo` is equivalent to the `gpt-3.5-turbo` model from OpenAI.\nL202: \nL203: Unlike previous GPT-3 and GPT-3.5 models, the `gpt-35-turbo` model as well as the `gpt-4` and `gpt-4-32k` models will continue to be updated. When creating a \u30109\u2020deployment\u3011 of these models, you'll also need to specify a model version.\nL204: \nL205: You can find the model retirement dates for these models on our \u301010\u2020models\u3011 page.\nL206: \nL207: ## Working with the Chat Completion API\nL208: \nL209: OpenAI trained the GPT-35-Turbo and GPT-4 models to accept input formatted as a conversation. The messages parameter takes an array of message objects with a conversation organized by role. When using the Python API a list of dictionaries is used.\nL210: \nL211: The format of a basic Chat Completion is as follows:\nL212: \nL213:     {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"Provide some context and/or instructions to the model\"},\nL214:     {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"The users messages goes here\"}\nL215: \nL216: A conversation with one example answer followed by a question would look like:\nL217: \nL218:     {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"Provide some context and/or instructions to the model.\"},\nL219:     {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Example question goes here.\"},\nL220:     {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"Example answer goes here.\"},\nL221:     {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"First question/message for the model to actually respond to.\"}\nL222: \nL223: ### System role\nL224: \nL225: The system role also known as the system message is included at the beginning of the array. This message provides the initial instructions to the model. You can provide various information in the system role including:\nL226: \nL227:   * A brief description of the assistant\nL228:   * Personality traits of the assistant\nL229:   * Instructions or rules you would like the assistant to follow\nL230:   * Data or information needed for the model, such as relevant questions from an FAQ\nL231: \nL232: You can customize the system role for your use case or just include basic instructions. The system role/message is optional, but it's recommended to at least include a basic one to get the best results.\nL233: \nL234: ### Messages\nL235: \nL236: After the system role, you can include a series of messages between the user and the assistant.\nL237: \nL238:      {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"What is thermodynamics?\"}\nL239: \nL240: To trigger a response from the model, you should end with a user message indicating that it's the assistant's turn to respond. You can also include a series of example messages between the user and the assistant as a way to do few shot learning.\nL241: \nL242: ### Message prompt examples\nL243: \nL244: The following section shows examples of different styles of prompts that you could use with the GPT-35-Turbo and GPT-4 models. These examples are just a starting point, and you can experiment with different prompts to customize the behavior for your own use cases.\nL245: \nL246: #### Basic example\nL247: \nL248: If you want the GPT-35-Turbo model to behave similarly to \u301011\u2020chat.openai.com\u2020chat.openai.com\u3011, you can use a basic system message like \"Assistant is a large language model trained by OpenAI.\"\nL249: \nL250:     {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"Assistant is a large language model trained by OpenAI.\"},\nL251:     {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Who were the founders of Microsoft?\"}\nL252: \nL253: #### Example with instructions\nL254: \nL255: For some scenarios, you might want to give additional instructions to the model to define guardrails for what the model is able to do.\nL256: \nL257:     {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"Assistant is an intelligent chatbot designed to help users answer their tax related questions.\nL258:     Instructions: \nL259:     - Only answer questions related to taxes. \nL260:     - If you're unsure of an answer, you can say \"I don't know\" or \"I'm not sure\" and recommend users go to the IRS website for more information. \"},\nL261:     {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"When are my taxes due?\"}\nL262: \nL263: #### Using data for grounding\nL264: \nL265: You can also include relevant data or information in the system message to give the model extra context for the conversation.

If you set any of these parameters, you'll get an error.\nL187: \nL188: Every response includes a `finish_reason`. The possible values for `finish_reason` are:\nL189: \nL190:   * stop: API returned complete model output.\nL191:   * length: Incomplete model output due to max_tokens parameter or token limit.\nL192:   * content_filter: Omitted content due to a flag from our content filters.\nL193:   * null:API response still in progress or incomplete.\nL194: \nL195: Consider setting `max_tokens` to a slightly higher value than normal such as 300 or 500. This ensures that the model doesn't stop generating text before it reaches the end of the message.\nL196: \nL197: ## Model versioning\nL198: \nL199: Note\nL200: \nL201: `gpt-35-turbo` is equivalent to the `gpt-3.5-turbo` model from OpenAI.\nL202: \nL203: Unlike previous GPT-3 and GPT-3.5 models, the `gpt-35-turbo` model as well as the `gpt-4` and `gpt-4-32k` models will continue to be updated. When creating a deployment of these models, you'll also need to specify a model version.\nL204: \nL205: You can find the model retirement dates for these models on our models page.\nL206: \nL207: ## Working with the Chat Completion API\nL208: \nL209: OpenAI trained the GPT-35-Turbo and GPT-4 models to accept input formatted as a conversation. The messages parameter takes an array of message objects with a conversation organized by role. When using the Python API a list of dictionaries is used.\nL210: \nL211: The format of a basic Chat Completion is as follows:\nL212: \nL213:     {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"Provide some context and/or instructions to the model\"},\nL214:     {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"The users messages goes here\"}\nL215: \nL216: A conversation with one example answer followed by a question would look like:\nL217: \nL218:     {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"Provide some context and/or instructions to the model.\"},\nL219:     {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Example question goes here.\"},\nL220:     {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"Example answer goes here.\"},\nL221:     {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"First question/message for the model to actually respond to.\"}\nL222: \nL223: ### System role\nL224: \nL225: The system role also known as the system message is included at the beginning of the array. This message provides the initial instructions to the model. You can provide various information in the system role including:\nL226: \nL227:   * A brief description of the assistant\nL228:   * Personality traits of the assistant\nL229:   * Instructions or rules you would like the assistant to follow\nL230:   * Data or information needed for the model, such as relevant questions from an FAQ\nL231: \nL232: You can customize the system role for your use case or just include basic instructions. The system role/message is optional, but it's recommended to at least include a basic one to get the best results.\nL233: \nL234: ### Messages\nL235: \nL236: After the system role, you can include a series of messages between the user and the assistant.\nL237: \nL238:      {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"What is thermodynamics?\"}\nL239: \nL240: To trigger a response from the model, you should end with a user message indicating that it's the assistant's turn to respond.

During or after the sign-in workflow, select the appropriate directory, Azure subscription, and Azure OpenAI resource.\nL49: \nL50: From the Azure OpenAI Studio landing page, select Chat playground.\nL51: \nL52: \u301010\u2020 \u3011 \nL53: \nL54: ## Playground\nL55: \nL56: Start exploring OpenAI capabilities with a no-code approach through the Azure OpenAI Studio Chat playground. From this page, you can quickly iterate and experiment with the capabilities.\nL57: \nL58: \u301011\u2020 \u3011 \nL59: \nL60: ### Assistant setup\nL61: \nL62: You can use the Assistant setup dropdown to select a few pre-loaded System message examples to get started.\nL63: \nL64: System messages give the model instructions about how it should behave and any context it should reference when generating a response. You can describe the assistant's personality, tell it what it should and shouldn't answer, and tell it how to format responses.\nL65: \nL66: Add few-shot examples allows you to provide conversational examples that are used by the model for \u301012\u2020in-context learning\u3011.\nL67: \nL68: At any time while using the Chat playground you can select View code to see Python, curl, and json code samples pre-populated based on your current chat session and settings selections. You can then take this code and write an application to complete the same task you're currently performing with the playground.\nL69: \nL70: ### Chat session\nL71: \nL72: Selecting the Send button sends the entered text to the completions API and the results are returned back to the text box.\nL73: \nL74: Select the Clear chat button to delete the current conversation history.\nL75: \nL76: ### Settings\nL77: \nL78: Name Description  \nL79: Deployments Your deployment name that is associated with a specific model.  \nL80: Temperature Controls randomness. Lowering the temperature means that the model produces more repetitive and deterministic responses. Increasing the temperature results in more unexpected or creative responses. Try adjusting temperature or Top P but not both.  \nL81: Max length (tokens) Set a limit on the number of tokens per model response. The API supports a maximum of 4096 tokens shared between the prompt (including system message, examples, message history, and user query) and the model's response. One token is roughly four characters for typical English text.  \nL82: Top probabilities Similar to temperature, this controls randomness but uses a different method. Lowering Top P narrows the model\u2019s token selection to likelier tokens. Increasing Top P lets the model choose from tokens with both high and low likelihood. Try adjusting temperature or Top P but not both.  \nL83: Multi-turn conversations Select the number of past messages to include in each new API request. This helps give the model context for new user queries. Setting this number to 10 results in five user queries and five system responses.  \nL84: Stop sequences Stop sequence make the model end its response at a desired point. The model response ends before the specified sequence, so it won't contain the stop sequence text. For GPT-35-Turbo, using `((im_end))` ensures that the model response doesn't generate a follow-up user query. You can include as many as four stop sequences.  \nL85: \nL86: ### Show panels\nL87: \nL88: By default there are three panels: assistant setup, chat session, and settings. Show panels allows you to add, remove, and rearrange the panels. If you ever close a panel and need to get it back, use Show panels to restore the lost panel.\nL89: \nL90: ## Start a chat session\nL91: \nL92:   1.

Lowering the temperature means that the model produces more repetitive and deterministic responses. Increasing the temperature results in more unexpected or creative responses. Try adjusting temperature or Top P but not both.  \nMax length (tokens) Set a limit on the number of tokens per model response. The API supports a maximum of 4096 tokens shared between the prompt (including system message, examples, message history, and user query) and the model's response. One token is roughly four characters for typical English text.  \nTop probabilities Similar to temperature, this controls randomness but uses a different method. Lowering Top P narrows the model\u2019s token selection to likelier tokens. Increasing Top P lets the model choose from tokens with both high and low likelihood. Try adjusting temperature or Top P but not both.  \nMulti-turn conversations Select the number of past messages to include in each new API request. This helps give the model context for new user queries. Setting this number to 10 results in five user queries and five system responses.  \nStop sequences Stop sequence make the model end its response at a desired point. The model response ends before the specified sequence, so it won't contain the stop sequence text. For GPT-35-Turbo, using `<|im_end|>` ensures that the model response doesn't generate a follow-up user query. You can include as many as four stop sequences.  ",

Considering the evolutionary perspective, colors that are generally perceived as calming and reassuring could be ideal. Here are some suggestions:\n\n1. **Soft Green (RGB: 144, 238, 144)**: Evokes feelings of nature and calmness. Green is often seen as restful for the eyes and is associated with growth and health.\n\n2. **Sky Blue (RGB: 135, 206, 235)**: Reminiscent of clear skies, this color can inspire calmness and serenity. It's often used in environments meant to relax people.\n\n3. **Pale Blue (RGB: 175, 238, 238)**: A lighter shade of blue that can be calming and stress-reducing. It's less stimulating and promotes a sense of peace.\n\n4. **Soft Gray (RGB: 211, 211, 211)**: A neutral color that is understated and unobtrusive. It can be calming and can minimize sensory overload.\n\n5. **Lavender (RGB: 230, 230, 250)**: Known for its soothing qualities, it can promote relaxation and calmness.\n\nThese colors are less likely to be overstimulating or to evoke strong emotional responses, which can be helpful in reducing stress. You might want to choose a color that you personally find calming and pleasant, as individual responses can vary."

                            "You're correct in noting that colors, as we perceive them, don't exist independently of our sensory experiences. Color is essentially the brain's interpretation of different wavelengths of light. This interpretation is subjective and can vary between individuals and species.\n\nIn the absence of an observer with the visual capability to perceive them, these wavelengths do not inherently possess color. The color is created by our perceptual processes. This phenomenon is a fascinating intersection of physics, biology, and psychology, revealing how our brains construct reality based on sensory inputs.\n\nThe emotional and psychological reactions we have to these colors are deeply intertwined with this perceptual process, further underscoring how subjective and personal our experience of the world is. The impact of color on mood and feeling, while widely recognized, is also a product of this complex interplay between sensory input and brain processing."

However, as of my last update in April 2023, only DALL\u00b7E 2 has been publicly released. DALL\u00b7E 2 significantly improved upon the original DALL\u00b7E in terms of image quality, resolution, and creative capabilities. There haven't been any official releases or announcements of versions beyond DALL\u00b7E 2, including DALL\u00b7E 3, 4, or any higher versions up to DALL\u00b7E 99, as you've listed.\n\nInnovation in AI, especially in the field of generative models, is rapid and continuous.

Typically, transcription errors result in random or phonetically similar inaccuracies rather than such systematic patterns.\n\nA few potential explanations for this kind of error could include:\n\n1. **Algorithmic Glitch:** The voice recognition software might have experienced a glitch or bug, leading to a repeated pattern error.\n\n2. **Accidental Activation of a Shortcut or Command:** Some voice-to-text systems have shortcuts or commands that can be accidentally triggered, leading to unexpected outputs.\n\n3. **Background Input:** Unintended background noise or voices, possibly from a nearby device or media, could have been misinterpreted by the software.\n\n4. **Software Limitation:** The software might have limitations or quirks in processing certain sounds or phrases, leading to repetitive or patterned errors.\n\nIt's difficult to determine the exact cause without more specific information about the software's functioning and the environment at the time of the error.
