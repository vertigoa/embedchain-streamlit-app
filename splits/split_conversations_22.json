                            "To start the Docker daemon, you will typically use a service command. However, the exact command depends on your system's init system. Here are the common init systems and the commands to use:\n\n**Systemd (for newer systems like Ubuntu 16.04 and later)**\n\n1. To start the service:\n\n```bash\nsudo systemctl start docker\n```\n\n2. To ensure the service starts when your system boots:\n\n```bash\nsudo systemctl enable docker\n```\n\n**Upstart (for older Ubuntu versions and some other Linux distributions)**\n\n1. To start the service:\n\n```bash\nsudo service docker start\n```\n\n2. To ensure the service starts when your system boots, you'll typically need to edit your init system's configuration files. Consult the specific documentation for your system.\n\n**SysV (for older systems, including CentOS 6 and older)**\n\n1. To start the service:\n\n```bash\nsudo service docker start\n```\n\n2. To ensure the service starts when your system boots:\n\n```bash\nsudo chkconfig docker on\n```\n\nRemember, if you're running commands with `sudo`, they must be run as a user with sudo privileges. If you're running as root, you don't need to include `sudo`. \n\nMake sure Docker is properly installed on your system. If not, you can install it using the package manager of your distribution (like apt for Ubuntu, yum for CentOS, etc). If you face any problems while starting the Docker daemon, check the system logs, Docker usually logs to `journalctl -u docker.service` on Systemd systems.\n\nAlso note that on many systems, Docker will be set up to start on boot by default after it's installed."

Start typing \"Docker\" and Docker Desktop should appear in the search results.\n\n3. Click on Docker Desktop to start the application.\n\nAfter starting Docker Desktop, the Docker daemon should also start up inside the Docker Desktop virtual machine. \n\nIf you're having trouble starting Docker, it may be a good idea to check if there are any updates available for Docker Desktop, or to try restarting your computer.\n\nRemember, Docker Desktop requires Windows 10 Pro or Enterprise version 14393 to run, or you can use WSL 2 on Windows 10 Home."

The containers will run in the background, and you can inspect their logs or interact with them using other Docker commands.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the command components:\n- \"docker-compose\": This command is used to manage multi-container Docker applications based on a Compose file (usually named \"docker-compose.yml\").\n- \"up\": This subcommand is used to create and start containers for the services defined in the Compose file. It will pull the necessary Docker images if they are not already present.\n- \"-d\": This flag instructs Docker Compose to run the containers in detached mode, freeing up the terminal for other operations.\n\nOverall, \"docker-compose up -d\" is a common command to start containers defined in a Docker Compose file in the background, allowing you to work on other tasks while the containers run."

Let's embark on this journey through the fascinating world of statistics. \n\n---\n\n# **Part 1: The Birth of Statistics - Understanding Averages**\n\n## **Milestone 1: The Concept of Average**\n\nIn the bustling markets of ancient Babylon, around 4,000 years ago, the concept of an 'average' was born. Imagine a merchant, let's call him Ashur, who sold grains. Ashur had to deal with varying quantities of grain each day. Some days, he had a bounty, while on others, he barely had enough to fill a sack. \n\nAshur, being a clever man, started recording the amount of grain he sold each day. After a month, he added up all the quantities and divided the total by the number of days. This gave him a number that represented a 'typical' day's sale. This number, dear reader, is what we now call the 'average' or 'mean'. \n\nThe concept of average is a fundamental building block in statistics. It provides a single value that represents a set of values. It's like a snapshot of a bustling city, capturing the essence of the city's life in one frame.\n\nLet's see how we can illustrate this concept using a simple Scratch program.\n\n[Assistant to=Creaticode_Extension_of_MIT_Scratch.getListOfAllBlocks]intentionally_blank{}[/Assistant]\n[Assistant to=Creaticode_Extension_of_MIT_Scratch.getBlockDescription]intentionally_blank{}[/Assistant]\n[Assistant to=Creaticode_Extension_of_MIT_Scratch.getCodeImage]intentionally_blank{}[/Assistant]\n\n## **Milestone 2: The Power of Variability**\n\nAs Ashur continued his business, he realized that the average was not enough to understand his sales. Some days, his sales were close to the average, while on others, they were wildly different. He needed a way to understand this variability.\n\nEnter the concept of 'variance'. Variance measures how spread out the numbers in a data set are. If the variance is low, it means the numbers are close to the average. If it's high, the numbers are spread out over a wider range.\n\nImagine a flock of birds flying in the sky. If the birds are flying close together, the variance is low. If they are spread out across the sky, the variance is high.\n\nLet's illustrate this concept with a Scratch program.\n\n[Assistant to=Creaticode_Extension_of_MIT_Scratch.getListOfAllBlocks]intentionally_blank{}[/Assistant]\n[Assistant to=Creaticode_Extension_of_MIT_Scratch.getBlockDescription]intentionally_blank{}[/Assistant]\n[Assistant to=Creaticode_Extension_of_MIT_Scratch.getCodeImage]intentionally_blank{}[/Assistant]\n\n---\n\nThese two concepts, the average and variance, form the foundation of statistics. They are the first steps in understanding and interpreting data. As we move forward, we'll build upon these concepts, diving deeper into the fascinating world of statistics. \n\nStay tuned for the next part of our journey, where we'll explore the concept of 'probability' and its profound impact on the field of statistics."

You can modify it as needed for your Jupyter notebook:\n\n```python\nprompt = \"\"\"\nWrite a magazine length story on the entirety of statistics, focusing on the most important concepts for modern science and data enthusiast. The story should be chronological, with each concept building off the previous one. The target audience is readers who have a basic understanding of high school mathematics. The story should be well written, technical enough to be thorough but still accessible to these readers. It should be intellectually entertaining, with a touch of emotion, and not juvenile or campy. Each concept or milestone should be titled and followed by a summary and detailed explanation, using creative examples and analogies to make the concepts clear and entertaining. The story should be broken down into sections or subsections as appropriate. It should include illustrations or interactive embedded apps from CreatiCode Scratch whenever needed. \n\nThe first two concepts and milestones to cover are:\n\n1. The Concept of Average: Explain the concept of an average, its historical origins, and its importance in statistics. Use a creative example or analogy to make the concept clear and entertaining.\n\n2. The Power of Variability: Explain the concept of variance, its importance in understanding data, and how it builds on the concept of an average. Use a creative example or analogy to make the concept clear and entertaining.\n\nAfter writing about these two concepts, evaluate the story and make any necessary adjustments before continuing with the rest of the concepts in statistics.\n\"\"\"\n```\n\nYou can then use this prompt with the OpenAI API in your Jupyter notebook to generate the rest of the story. I'm glad you're finding this approach helpful for teaching statistics!"

                            "Sure, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) can be performed to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset and identify the most important features. However, PCA is typically performed on numerical data. In this dataset, we have a mix of numerical and categorical data. \n\nBefore we proceed, we need to decide how to handle the categorical variables. One common approach is to convert them into numerical form using techniques like one-hot encoding. However, this can significantly increase the dimensionality of the dataset, which might not be ideal for PCA.\n\nAnother point to consider is that PCA is a linear method, which means it might not capture complex relationships in the data. \n\nFinally, PCA is a unsupervised method, so it doesn't take into account any information about the outcomes or dependent variable (if there is one). \n\nGiven these considerations, could you please clarify how you would like to handle the categorical variables and what your goals are for performing PCA? Are you interested in data visualization, feature selection, or some other application?"

I'm unable to create a project at the moment. \n\nHowever, I can guide you on how to do it manually. Here are the steps:\n\n1. Go to Noteable's website and log in to your account.\n2. Click on \"Create Project\" and name it \"BikeTheftsAnalysis\".\n3. Once the project is created, you can upload your \"bikethefts.csv\" file to this project.\n4. Create a new Python notebook within this project.\n5. In the notebook, you can load the data using pandas' `read_csv` function like this:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndata = pd.read_csv('bikethefts.csv')\ndata.head()\n```\n\n6. After loading the data, you can perform various analyses and create visualizations using libraries like pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, etc.\n\nIf you need specific help with the analysis or creating visualizations, feel free to ask!"

                            "Yes, an API key could potentially help with authentication issues. However, as an AI developed by OpenAI, I don't have the capability to directly use API keys for authentication due to privacy and security reasons. \n\nI recommend using the API key in your local environment to authenticate and access the notebook. If you're using a Python script, you can use the `requests` library to send HTTP requests with the API key for authentication.\n\nHere's a general example of how you might use the API key:\n\n```python\nimport requests\n\nurl = \"https://app.noteable.io/api/endpoint\"  # replace with the actual API endpoint\nheaders = {\"Authorization\": \"Bearer YOUR_API_KEY\"}  # replace YOUR_API_KEY with your actual API key\n\nresponse = requests.get(url, headers=headers)\n\n# handle the response\n```\n\nPlease replace `\"https://app.noteable.io/api/endpoint\"` with the actual API endpoint you're trying to access, and replace `\"Bearer YOUR_API_KEY\"` with `\"Bearer \"` followed by your actual API key.\n\nRemember to keep your API key secure and do not share it with others."

                            "The Gate2AI plugin is a tool designed to identify and suggest appropriate AI tools for any task. It's essentially a search engine for AI tools. You input your task, problem, or use case into the plugin, and it generates a curated list of suitable AI tools. \n\nHere's how you can use it effectively:\n\n1. **Define your task clearly**: The more specific you are about what you want to achieve, the better the plugin can assist you. For example, instead of searching for \"AI for video\", you might search for \"AI for creating animated videos\".\n\n2. **Explore the results**: The plugin will return a list of AI tools that might be suitable for your task. Each tool will have a brief description and a link to its website. Take the time to explore these tools and see which ones might be a good fit for your needs.\n\n3. **Reorganize by relevancy**: The plugin might return a lot of results, and not all of them will be equally relevant to your task. You'll need to reorganize the tools by their relevancy to your specific use case.\n\n4. **Understand the limitations**: The Gate2AI plugin can suggest tools, but it can't guarantee that they'll be perfect for your needs. You'll still need to evaluate each tool on its own merits.\n\nRemember, the Gate2AI plugin is just a tool to help you find other tools. It's up to you to decide which tools are the best fit for your needs."

                            "In the context of data points and lines, a projection refers to the process of mapping or transforming a set of data points from their original space to a lower-dimensional space, such as a line. This is often done in the field of data analysis and machine learning for dimensionality reduction or for visualization purposes.\n\nHere's a simple example: suppose you have a set of points in a 2D space (i.e., each point has an x and y coordinate). You can project these points onto a line (1D space) by finding the closest point on the line for each data point. This process reduces the dimensionality of the data from 2D to 1D.\n\nThe projection of a point onto a line is the point on the line that is closest to the original point. If the line is defined by a direction vector, then the projection of a point onto the line can be found by taking the dot product of the vector from the origin to the point and the unit vector in the direction of the line.\n\nIn a more general sense, projection is a key concept in linear algebra and is used in various fields such as computer graphics, signal processing, and data analysis."

                            "Sure, let's visualize this with an example.\n\nConsider a point in a 2D space, let's say (1,2) which is represented by the red dot in the image below. We also have a line (in blue) that passes through the origin (0,0) and another point (3,3).\n\n![Projection Example](https://www.wolframcloud.com/obj/cf3891e4-8164-4de9-bc3e-13d4548f9f64)\n\nThe green dashed line represents the projection of the point onto the line. This is the shortest distance from the point to the line, and the point where this line intersects the blue line is the projection of the point onto the line. In this case, the projection of the point (1,2) onto the line is the point (1,1).\n\nThis is a simple example in 2D space, but the concept extends to higher dimensions as well. For instance, you could project points from a 3D space onto a plane (2D space), or from a 4D space onto a 3D space, and so on. The principle remains the same: the projection of a point onto a lower-dimensional space is the closest point in that space to the original point."

                            "Yes, I apologize for the confusion earlier. The projection of a point onto a line is indeed the point on the line that is closest to the original point. This is achieved by drawing a line from the point to the line that is perpendicular to the line. The point where this perpendicular line intersects the original line is the projection of the point onto the line.\n\nIn the corrected diagram, the green dashed line is indeed perpendicular to the blue line and represents the shortest distance from the point (1,2) to the line. The point where this line intersects the blue line is the projection of the point onto the line. In this case, the projection of the point (1,2) onto the line is approximately the point (1.5,1.5).\n\nI hope this clears up any confusion. Please let me know if you have any further questions!"

                            "In Principal Component Analysis (PCA), the goal is to find the direction (or directions in higher dimensions) where the data varies the most. In other words, we want to find the \"best fit line\" such that when we project our data onto this line, the variance (or spread) of the projected points is maximized.\n\nThis is done by calculating the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the covariance matrix of the data. The eigenvector corresponding to the largest eigenvalue is the direction that explains the most variance in the data. This is the \"best fit line\" or the first principal component.\n\nWhen you project the data points onto this line, the spread of the points along the line is maximized. This is because the line is chosen such that it captures the most variance in the data.\n\nLet's visualize this with an example. Suppose we have a set of points in a 2D space. The first principal component (the best fit line) will be the line that captures the most variance in the data. When we project the points onto this line, the spread of the points along the line will be maximized.\n\nLet me generate a visualization to help illustrate this."

                            "I apologize for the technical difficulties. There seems to be an issue with generating the visualization. \n\nHowever, I can explain the concept further. In Principal Component Analysis (PCA), the \"best fit line\" is the line that maximizes the variance of the projected points. This line is the first principal component.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of what happens in PCA:\n\n1. Standardize the data (if necessary). This involves centering the data around 0 by subtracting the mean and scaling by the standard deviation.\n\n2. Calculate the covariance matrix of the data. This matrix measures how much each pair of features (dimensions) vary together.\n\n3. Compute the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the covariance matrix. The eigenvectors represent the directions of the new feature space, and the eigenvalues represent the magnitude of these directions.\n\n4. Sort the eigenvalues in descending order and choose the top k eigenvectors that correspond to the largest k eigenvalues. The number k is the number of dimensions of the new feature subspace (k \u2264 n, where n is the number of original dimensions).\n\n5. Transform the original dataset via the selected eigenvectors to obtain a k-dimensional feature subspace.\n\nThe first principal component (the best fit line) is the direction (eigenvector) in the data that explains the most variance (has the largest eigenvalue). When you project the data points onto this line, the spread of the points along the line is maximized. This is because the line is chosen such that it captures the most variance in the data. \n\nI hope this explanation helps! Let me know if you have any further questions."

                            "Absolutely, I'd be happy to explain port forwarding in simple terms.\n\nLet's start with some basic concepts:\n\n1. **Internet Protocol (IP) Address**: This is like your home's address. Just as letters sent by mail need your home address to reach you, data sent over the internet needs your IP address to find its way to your computer.\n\n2. **Ports**: These are like the doors or windows of your house. Each port on your computer is like a different entry point that a specific type of internet traffic (like email or web browsing) can use to get in or out.\n\n3. **Router**: This is like the main gate of your apartment complex. All internet traffic from your home's devices (computers, phones, gaming consoles, etc.) goes through this. The router usually has a public IP address which is exposed to the Internet, and the devices connected to it have private IP addresses which are used within your home network.\n\nNow, onto port forwarding...\n\nImagine you're in an apartment complex and you're expecting a friend (let's call him Bob) to visit. Bob can reach your apartment complex because he knows its address, but once he's at the gate, he doesn't know which apartment you're in.\n\nPort forwarding is like leaving instructions with the security guard at the gate (the router) to guide Bob to your specific apartment (your device) when he arrives. These instructions might be: \"If a guy named Bob arrives, guide him to apartment 203.\" \n\nIn terms of computers and routers, port forwarding works like this:\n\nWhen certain data (like Bob) arrives at your router from the internet, it might not know which device (or apartment) within your home network to send it to. This could be data for a game you're playing, or for a web server you're running, for example. \n\nWith port forwarding, you're telling your router: \"If data comes in on a specific port (Bob), please send it to this specific device in my home network (apartment 203).\" This way, your game or web server gets the data it needs, and everything works smoothly.\n\nThis is a simplified explanation and it can get more complex, but I hope this gives you a general idea of what port forwarding is all about."

                            "Sure, here are some real-world examples of where port forwarding is particularly useful:\n\n1. **Home Web Servers**: Let's say you have a web server running from a computer in your home, and you want it to be accessible from the internet. By default, your router won't know to direct incoming web traffic (typically on port 80 for HTTP or 443 for HTTPS) to this specific computer. Using port forwarding, you can tell the router to send all traffic that comes in on these ports to your web server.\n\n2. **Online Gaming**: Online multiplayer games often require incoming connections to be able to connect to your gaming console or PC. This is especially true for peer-to-peer games where there isn't a central server, but instead, one of the player's systems acts as the host. By setting up port forwarding for the specific ports your game uses, you can ensure a stable and fast connection with other players.\n\n3. **Remote Desktop**: If you want to remotely access your home computer from somewhere else, you might use a Remote Desktop protocol that operates on a specific port (for example, port 3389 for Windows Remote Desktop). You can set up port forwarding on your router to direct incoming connections on this port to your home computer, enabling you to access it from anywhere.\n\n4. **Surveillance Cameras**: If you have security cameras in your home that you want to be able to monitor remotely, you can use port forwarding to allow your phone or other device to access the video feed over the internet. \n\n5. **IoT Devices**: Devices like smart home controllers often need to be accessible from the internet, whether to receive updates or to allow you to control them remotely. Port forwarding can ensure these connections reach the correct device.\n\n6. **Peer-to-Peer (P2P) File Sharing**: Some P2P file sharing applications (like BitTorrent) will work better if they can accept incoming connections. Port forwarding can enable this by routing incoming connections on specific ports to the computer running the file-sharing application.\n\nRemember, while port forwarding can enable these functionalities, it can also potentially expose your devices to the internet, so it's important to only forward necessary ports and ensure that any device you're making accessible has strong security measures in place."

                            "Sure, I'd be glad to help you with that. \n\nThe Master of Science in Data Analytics (MSDA) program at Western Governors University (WGU) is a competency-based program, meaning the time it takes to complete the program varies based on a number of factors including your prior knowledge, learning style, and the amount of time you can dedicate to studying each week. \n\nAs of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021, the average time to complete a master's degree at WGU was 1-2 years. However, there are certainly students who complete their programs in less time, particularly if they can dedicate a significant amount of time to their studies each week. \n\nThat being said, it's important to note that the MSDA program is rigorous and involves mastering complex concepts and skills. In order to complete the program in 12 weeks, you would likely need to dedicate a significant amount of time each week to your studies, and you may find it beneficial to have some prior knowledge or experience in the field. \n\nHere's a general approach you might consider:\n\n1. **Create a Study Schedule:** Figure out how much time you can dedicate to your studies each week, and then create a schedule that allocates specific times for studying. Make sure to allow time for breaks and self-care as well.\n\n2. **Prioritize Your Courses:** Look at the course list for the MSDA program and prioritize your courses. You might want to start with the courses you feel most comfortable with to build momentum, or you might choose to tackle the most challenging courses first while you're fresh.\n\n3. **Utilize WGU Resources:** WGU offers a number of resources to help students succeed, including course materials, mentors, and online communities. Make sure to take advantage of these resources.\n\n4. **Stay Organized:** Keep track of your assignments, due dates, and other important information. This can help you stay on top of your workload and ensure you don't fall behind.\n\n5. **Seek Help When Needed:** If you're struggling with a particular concept or assignment, don't hesitate to seek help. This could be from your mentor, fellow students, or other resources.\n\n6. **Keep a Positive Attitude:** It's important to stay positive and motivated, even when things get tough. Remember why you're doing this and what you're working towards.\n\nThis is a general approach and may need to be tailored to your specific situation and needs. It might be a good idea to speak with a mentor or academic advisor at WGU to discuss your plan and get their input.\n\nGiven the significant changes that may have occurred since my last training data in September 2021, I can use the `browser` tool to find more recent information about the MSDA program at WGU and provide more specific advice. Would you like me to do that?"

This ensures that you learn best practices for the latest developments in data analytics.  \n\nThis information technology degree program is composed of the following courses. You will typically complete them one at a time as you make your way through your program, working with your Program Mentor each term to build your personalized Degree Plan. You\u2019ll work through each course as quickly as you can study and learn the material. As soon as you\u2019re ready, you\u2019ll pass the assessment, complete the course, and move on. This means you can finish as many courses as you're able in a term at no additional cost.\n\nThe M.S. Data Analytics degree program is an all-online program that you will complete through independent study with the support of WGU faculty. You will be expected to complete at least 8 competency units (WGU's equivalent of the credit hour) each 6-month term. (Each course is typically 3 or 4 units). There\u2019s no limit on the number of units you can complete each term, so the more courses you complete, the quicker you can finish your program.\n\n DOWNLOAD PROGRAM DETAILS  \n\nData Analytics\n\nAdvanced Data Analytics\n\nAdvanced Data Analytics prepares students for career-long growth in steadily advancing tools and techniques and provides emerging concepts in data analysis.

Become a Redditor and join one of thousands of communities.\u3011\u00d7\n\n35 \n\n36 \n\n37\n\n\u301055\u2020Completing WGU's Masters of Data Analytics in 1 Term\u3011 (\u301054\u2020self.WGU\u3011)\n\nsubmitted 4 years ago by \u301074\u2020Harper-Smith\u3011\n\nWGU is an awesome school and worth the time and money. I would argue it was more difficult than the brick and mortar universities which I attended. My total cost, with the $500/term New Year New You scholarship and some other $200 credit for being a school teacher, worked out to just under $3000 and resulted in a immediate $3500/yr raise. I am glad that I did the program in 1 term, but I would only recommend this path to someone who both them and their spouse are fine with you sacrificing everything you know. Sleep, fun, family time, and sleep (notice how I said sleep twice). This program is not an easy walk in the park.\n\nMy background leading up to doing the program:\n\nThroughout most of my undergraduate at \"brick and mortar\" universities, I always had between 19 and 23 credits on my plate (with the exception of the semester I got married). So, I was used to being quite busy. My undergraduate degrees were in Mathematics Education and Business/Marketing Education. So, I was not a total stranger to programming and statistics. During this term, our 1 year old seamed to be teething every other week, my wife was pregnant (bless her for how supportive she was), and I worked full time (I did have 2 months of summer vacation to work on the coursework all day every day). So, while I did have some stats and computer programming on my side, I did have many responsibilities which I still needed to fulfill. \n\nMy advice for anyone who is looking to do the program:\n\n1- Don't overthink the project based finals (C740, C742, C744, C745 and C772). Answer the points that they are looking for on the grading rubric and you will pass first try. (Yes, many of mine got sent back because I did not put enough sources on my papers or the formatting of the sources was not correct).\n\n2- Do the SAS courses right after the C742 Data Science Tools and Techniques. Basically, make them the 4th and 5th class that you take. The SAS courses have some great videos which will prepare you much better for C743-C746. I had an awesome mentor who proposed the idea and it was probably the best move I made. \n\n3- Take really good notes for the certs, the SQL test was the only one of the 5 tests during the program which I had to retake. \n\n4- Despite what others will tell you, do C772 Capstone last. I was cutting things close and I really didn't want to pay for a second term (FYI: If you are almost done they will, under many circumstances, prorate your last term). My mentor informed me not to worry and to strive to get everything but the capstone done before the end of the term. If I was able to that, she could put in for a 1 month term extension- which they can only grant IF the capstone is your ONLY class unfinished. So, I finished all of the coursework and tests 2 days before the end of the term with the exception of the capstone project and my mentor got me 1 additional month for free! Yay! So, while I didn't complete the program in 6 months, I still did complete the program in 1 term. \n\n5- Make the C772 Capstone project simple. Originally, I wanted to do a massive project which would help legislatures see why so many teachers leave their profession, make some massive impression on how the state handles teachers, have the work published, ect. But, there was a lot of red tape on that project due to HIPPA and FERPA. So, my awesome course instructor gave me the advice that the purpose of the project was not to change the world but to show that I had the knowledge to do so. I took his advice and changed the project to one with no red tape. 10 days before my month was up, I got an email notifying my that I had graduated WGU with a masters degree in data analytics. It was a great feeling. I would have finished the capstone sooner, but I was quite burned out by the end of the 6 months and took a week off. \n\nOverall, WGU is an awesome school and worth the time and money. I would argue it was more difficult than the brick and mortar universities which I attended. I am glad that I did the program in 1 term, but I would only recommend this path to someone who is fine being a hermit for the next 6-7 months of their life. \n\nHopefully this helps one of you future or current WGU MSDA students.\n\n\u200b\n\n  * \u301055\u202015 comments\u3011\n  * share \n  * save\n  * hide \n  * report \n\nall 15 comments \n\nsorted by: \n\nbest\n\n\u301075\u2020top\u3011\u301076\u2020new\u3011\u301077\u2020controversial\u3011\u301078\u2020old\u3011\u301079\u2020random\u3011\u301080\u2020q&a\u3011\u301081\nVisible: 4% - 51%",

These are some tips I wanted to pass along. Many of these are gathered from advices given by other students in slack and directly to me.\n\n  * Everyone has different backgrounds and ability to retain, but I estimate to put in 10-20 hours per week of study time. I personally spent 6 hours on weekends and one hour each week day.\n  * Identify a support system \u2014 if you have a family and work full time, discuss your plans and need for study hours on weekends.\n  * Identify a study location, and keep it organized. I used to take OAs at my office after hours to avoid interruptions.\n  * *Work on something every single day*\n  * Start studying before the term starts, either study for certs you know you\u2019ll have to take or activate a course during the 15 day window prior to the start of the term.\n  * Don\u2019t worry about being perfect, just worry about passing.\n  * If you are familiar with the material to some extent, take the pre-assessment immediately to gauge your knowledge. If you score high, take the final.\n  * If you need help with planning don\u2019t be scared to discuss with your Mentor and let them know your plan ahead of time. Once you gain confidence of your mentor by passing first 3 courses quickly, they will be more open to helping you progress faster.\n  * Set goals and stick to them. Eg. set date for taking an OA or Certification.\n  * Use the degree specific Slack channel to ask questions and stay motivated.\n  * Use the chatter, and search reddit.com/r/wgu for useful tips. Organize them in your note taking tool. I use Microsoft OneNote.\n  * Capstone seems to be taking longer now, with stricter rules for acceptance. Think of datasets early on, and discuss with the CI once enrolled.

These are some tips I wanted to pass along. Many of these are gathered from advices given by other students in slack and directly to me.\n\n  * Everyone has different backgrounds and ability to retain, but I estimate to put in 10-20 hours per week of study time. I personally spent 6 hours on weekends and one hour each week day.\n  * Identify a support system \u2014 if you have a family and work full time, discuss your plans and need for study hours on weekends.\n  * Identify a study location, and keep it organized. I used to take OAs at my office after hours to avoid interruptions.\n  * *Work on something every single day*\n  * Start studying before the term starts, either study for certs you know you\u2019ll have to take or activate a course during the 15 day window prior to the start of the term.\n  * Don\u2019t worry about being perfect, just worry about passing.\n  * If you are familiar with the material to some extent, take the pre-assessment immediately to gauge your knowledge. If you score high, take the final.\n  * If you need help with planning don\u2019t be scared to discuss with your Mentor and let them know your plan ahead of time. Once you gain confidence of your mentor by passing first 3 courses quickly, they will be more open to helping you progress faster.\n  * Set goals and stick to them. Eg. set date for taking an OA or Certification.\n  * Use the degree specific Slack channel to ask questions and stay motivated.\n  * Use the chatter, and search reddit.com/r/wgu for useful tips. Organize them in your note taking tool. I use Microsoft OneNote.\n  * Capstone seems to be taking longer now, with stricter rules for acceptance. Think of datasets early on, and discuss with the CI once enrolled. Keep few different ideas open.\n\nGood luck.\n\n\u30103\u2020Productivity\u3011\n\n\u30104\u2020Wgu\u3011\n\n\u30105\u2020Data Analytics\u3011\n\n--\n\n--\n\n1\n\n[Image: Bajal]\n\nFollow\n\n\u30100\u2020Written by Bajal\u3011\n\n\u30106\u20206 Followers\u3011\n\nFollow \n\n## More from Bajal\n\n[Image]\n\n[Image: Bajal]\n\n\u30107\u2020Bajal\u3011\n\n\u30108\u2020Make git more useful with these helpful entries in your gitconfig Git is *the* most popular and powerful version control system for all of the code that you write.

These are some tips I wanted to pass along. Many of these are gathered from advices given by other students in slack and directly to me.\n\n  * Everyone has different backgrounds and ability to retain, but I estimate to put in 10-20 hours per week of study time. I personally spent 6 hours on weekends and one hour each week day.\n  * Identify a support system \u2014 if you have a family and work full time, discuss your plans and need for study hours on weekends.\n  * Identify a study location, and keep it organized. I used to take OAs at my office after hours to avoid interruptions.\n  * *Work on something every single day*\n  * Start studying before the term starts, either study for certs you know you\u2019ll have to take or activate a course during the 15 day window prior to the start of the term.\n  * Don\u2019t worry about being perfect, just worry about passing.\n  * If you are familiar with the material to some extent, take the pre-assessment immediately to gauge your knowledge. If you score high, take the final.\n  * If you need help with planning don\u2019t be scared to discuss with your Mentor and let them know your plan ahead of time. Once you gain confidence of your mentor by passing first 3 courses quickly, they will be more open to helping you progress faster.\n  * Set goals and stick to them. Eg. set date for taking an OA or Certification.\n  * Use the degree specific Slack channel to ask questions and stay motivated.\n  * Use the chatter, and search reddit.com/r/wgu for useful tips. Organize them in your note taking tool. I use Microsoft OneNote.\n  * Capstone seems to be taking longer now, with stricter rules for acceptance. Think of datasets early on, and discuss with the CI once enrolled. Keep few different ideas open.\n\nGood luck.\n\n\u30103\u2020Productivity\u3011\n\n\u30104\u2020Wgu\u3011\n\n\u30105\u2020Data Analytics\u3011\n\n--\n\n--\n\n1\n\n[Image: Bajal]\n\nFollow\n\n\u30100\u2020Written by Bajal\u3011\n\n\u30106\u20206 Followers\u3011\n\nFollow \n\n## More from Bajal\n\n[Image]\n\n[Image: Bajal]\n\n\u30107\u2020Bajal\u3011\n\n\u30108\u2020Make git more useful with these helpful entries in your gitconfig Git is *the* most popular and powerful version control system for all of the code that you write.

These are some tips I wanted to pass along. Many of these are gathered from advices given by other students in slack and directly to me.\n\n  * Everyone has different backgrounds and ability to retain, but I estimate to put in 10-20 hours per week of study time. I personally spent 6 hours on weekends and one hour each week day.\n  * Identify a support system \u2014 if you have a family and work full time, discuss your plans and need for study hours on weekends.\n  * Identify a study location, and keep it organized. I used to take OAs at my office after hours to avoid interruptions.\n  * *Work on something every single day*\n  * Start studying before the term starts, either study for certs you know you\u2019ll have to take or activate a course during the 15 day window prior to the start of the term.\n  * Don\u2019t worry about being perfect, just worry about passing.\n  * If you are familiar with the material to some extent, take the pre-assessment immediately to gauge your knowledge. If you score high, take the final.\n  * If you need help with planning don\u2019t be scared to discuss with your Mentor and let them know your plan ahead of time. Once you gain confidence of your mentor by passing first 3 courses quickly, they will be more open to helping you progress faster.\n  * Set goals and stick to them. Eg. set date for taking an OA or Certification.\n  * Use the degree specific Slack channel to ask questions and stay motivated.\n  * Use the chatter, and search reddit.com/r/wgu for useful tips. Organize them in your note taking tool. I use Microsoft OneNote.\n  * Capstone seems to be taking longer now, with stricter rules for acceptance. Think of datasets early on, and discuss with the CI once enrolled. Keep few different ideas open.\n\nGood luck.\n\nProductivity\n\nWgu\n\nData Analytics\n\n--\n\n--\n\n1\n\n[Image: Bajal]\n\nFollow\n\nWritten by Bajal\n\n6 Followers\n\nFollow \n\n## More from Bajal\n\n[Image]\n\n[Image: Bajal]\n\nBajal\n\nMake git more useful with these helpful entries in your gitconfig Git is *the* most popular and powerful version control system for all of the code that you write.

These are some tips I wanted to pass along. Many of these are gathered from advices given by other students in slack and directly to me.\n\n  * Everyone has different backgrounds and ability to retain, but I estimate to put in 10-20 hours per week of study time. I personally spent 6 hours on weekends and one hour each week day.\n  * Identify a support system \u2014 if you have a family and work full time, discuss your plans and need for study hours on weekends.\n  * Identify a study location, and keep it organized. I used to take OAs at my office after hours to avoid interruptions.\n  * *Work on something every single day*\n  * Start studying before the term starts, either study for certs you know you\u2019ll have to take or activate a course during the 15 day window prior to the start of the term.\n  * Don\u2019t worry about being perfect, just worry about passing.\n  * If you are familiar with the material to some extent, take the pre-assessment immediately to gauge your knowledge. If you score high, take the final.\n  * If you need help with planning don\u2019t be scared to discuss with your Mentor and let them know your plan ahead of time. Once you gain confidence of your mentor by passing first 3 courses quickly, they will be more open to helping you progress faster.\n  * Set goals and stick to them. Eg. set date for taking an OA or Certification.\n  * Use the degree specific Slack channel to ask questions and stay motivated.\n  * Use the chatter, and search reddit.com/r/wgu for useful tips. Organize them in your note taking tool. I use Microsoft OneNote.\n  * Capstone seems to be taking longer now, with stricter rules for acceptance. Think of datasets early on, and discuss with the CI once enrolled. Keep few different ideas open.\n\nGood luck.\n\n\u30103\u2020Productivity\u3011\n\n\u30104\u2020Wgu\u3011\n\n\u30105\u2020Data Analytics\u3011\n\n--\n\n--\n\n1\n\n[Image: Bajal]\n\nFollow\n\n\u30100\u2020Written by Bajal\u3011\n\n\u30106\u20206 Followers\u3011\n\nFollow \n\n## More from Bajal\n\n[Image]\n\n[Image: Bajal]\n\n\u30107\u2020Bajal\u3011\n\n\u30108\u2020Make git more useful with these helpful entries in your gitconfig Git is *the* most popular and powerful version control system for all of the code that you write.

                            "I researched the Master's in Data Analytics program offered by Western Governors University (WGU). Here is some key information I found:\n\n1. The program covers a variety of topics such as data science and analytics, data mining, machine learning, data management, and database applications. They use modern analytic tools and languages like Python, R, SQL, and Tableau\u301010\u2020source\u3011.\n\n2. There are a number of specific courses that make up the program. Some of them include: \n   - Advanced Data Analytics: Topics include machine learning, neural networks, randomness, and unconventional data sources\u301015\u2020source\u3011.\n   - Data Cleaning: This course teaches students how to manipulate, structure, and clean data as well as to reduce features in data sets\u301016\u2020source\u3011.\n   - Predictive Modeling: This course covers logistic regression and multiple regression to model the phenomena revealed by data\u301017\u2020source\u3011.\n   - Exploratory Data Analysis: This course covers statistical principles supporting the data analytics life cycle\u301018\u2020source\u3011.\n   - The Data Analytics Journey: An overview of the entire analytics life cycle\u301019\u2020source\u3011.\n   - Data Visualization: This course covers data visualizations, audio representations, and interactive dashboards\u301020\u2020source\u3011.\n\n3. The tuition is charged per term, rather than per credit, which can help you control the ultimate cost of your degree. The cost is $4,055 per six-month term\u301012\u2020source\u3011.\n\n4. If you have an Oracle SQL Expert certification, it may waive some course requirements\u301013\u2020source\u3011.\n\n5. About 70% of students finish the program within 23 months, but the speed at which you complete the program can be adjusted based on your existing knowledge and the time you can dedicate to the program\u301011\u2020source\u3011\u301014\u2020source\u3011.\n\nUnfortunately, while I attempted to find specific strategies or tips to complete the WGU MSDA program in 12 weeks, I encountered some technical issues with the research tool. I was unable to quote from several sources that may have had useful information. Therefore, this part of your question remains incomplete. I recommend reaching out directly to WGU or to students who have completed the program for further guidance. Online communities such as Reddit or student forums may also have useful tips and strategies."

The only information they can learn from is their training data. This information can be out-of-date and is one-size fits all across applications. Furthermore, the only thing language models can do out-of-the-box is emit text. This text can contain useful instructions, but to actually follow these instructions you need another process.\n\nThough not a perfect analogy, plugins can be \u201ceyes and ears\u201d for language models, giving them access to information that is too recent, too personal, or too specific to be included in the training data. In response to a user\u2019s explicit request, plugins can also enable language models to perform safe, constrained actions on their behalf, increasing the usefulness of the system overall.\n\nWe expect that open standards will emerge to unify the ways in which applications expose an AI-facing interface. We are working on an early attempt at what such a standard might look like, and we\u2019re looking for feedback from developers interested in building with us.\n\nToday, we\u2019re beginning to gradually enable existing plugins from our early collaborators for ChatGPT users, beginning with ChatGPT Plus subscribers. We\u2019re also beginning to roll out the ability for developers to create their own plugins for ChatGPT.\n\nIn the coming months, as we learn from deployment and continue to improve our safety systems, we\u2019ll iterate on this protocol, and we plan to enable developers using OpenAI models to integrate plugins into their own applications beyond ChatGPT.  \n\n## Safety and broader implications \n\nConnecting language models to external tools introduces new opportunities as well as significant \u301051\u2020new risks\u2020cdn.openai.com\u3011.\n\nPlugins offer the potential to tackle various challenges associated with large language models, including \u201challucinations,\u201d keeping up with recent events, and accessing (with permission) proprietary information sources. By integrating explicit access to external data\u2014such as up-to-date information online, code-based calculations, or custom plugin-retrieved information\u2014language models can strengthen their responses with evidence-based references.\n\nThese references not only enhance the model\u2019s utility but also enable users to assess the trustworthiness of the model\u2019s output and double-check its accuracy, potentially mitigating risks related to overreliance as discussed in our recent GPT-4 \u301051\u2020system card\u2020cdn.openai.com\u3011. Lastly, the value of plugins may go well beyond addressing existing limitations by helping users with a variety of new use cases, ranging from browsing product catalogs to booking flights or ordering food.\n\nAt the same time, there\u2019s a risk that plugins could increase safety challenges by taking harmful or unintended actions, increasing the capabilities of bad actors who would defraud, mislead, or abuse others. By increasing the range of possible applications, plugins may raise the risk of negative consequences from mistaken or misaligned actions taken by the model in new domains.

Plugins are tools designed specifically for language models with safety as a core principle, and help ChatGPT access up-to-date information, run computations, or use third-party services.  \n\n## Quick links\n\n  * Join plugins waitlist\n  * Read documentation\n\n[Image: Chat Plugins]\n\nIllustration: Ruby Chen   \n\nMarch 23, 2023\n\n### Authors\n\n  * OpenAI \n\nAnnouncements, Product\n\nIn line with our iterative deployment philosophy, we are gradually rolling out plugins in ChatGPT so we can study their real-world use, impact, and safety and alignment challenges\u2014all of which we\u2019ll have to get right in order to achieve our mission.\n\nUsers have been asking for plugins since we launched ChatGPT (and many developers are experimenting with similar ideas) because they unlock a vast range of possible use cases. We\u2019re starting with a small set of users and are planning to gradually roll out larger-scale access as we learn more (for plugin developers, ChatGPT users, and after an alpha period, API users who would like to integrate plugins into their products). We\u2019re excited to build a community shaping the future of the human\u2013AI interaction paradigm.\n\nPlugin developers who have been invited off our waitlist can use our documentation to build a plugin for ChatGPT, which then lists the enabled plugins in the prompt shown to the language model as well as documentation to instruct the model how to use each. The first plugins have been created by Expedia, FiscalNote, Instacart, KAYAK, Klarna, Milo, OpenTable, Shopify, Slack, Speak, Wolfram, and Zapier.\n\n[Image]\n\nExpedia Bring your trip plans to life\u2014get there, stay there, find things to see and do.\n\n[Image]\n\nFiscalNote Provides and enables access to select market-leading, real-time data sets for legal, political, and regulatory data and information.\n\n[Image]\n\nInstacart Order from your favorite local grocery stores.\n\n[Image]\n\nKAYAK Search for flights, stays and rental cars.

We\u2019ve also open-sourced the code for a knowledge base retrieval plugin, to be self-hosted by any developer with information with which they\u2019d like to augment ChatGPT.\n\nToday, we will begin extending plugin alpha access to users and developers from our waitlist. While we will initially prioritize a small number of developers and ChatGPT Plus users, we plan to roll out larger-scale access over time.  \n\n[Image: Example Of How To Use ChatGPT Plugins]\n\nExample of how to use ChatGPT plugins 00:59\n\n## Overview \n\nLanguage models today, while useful for a variety of tasks, are still limited. The only information they can learn from is their training data. This information can be out-of-date and is one-size fits all across applications. Furthermore, the only thing language models can do out-of-the-box is emit text. This text can contain useful instructions, but to actually follow these instructions you need another process.\n\nThough not a perfect analogy, plugins can be \u201ceyes and ears\u201d for language models, giving them access to information that is too recent, too personal, or too specific to be included in the training data. In response to a user\u2019s explicit request, plugins can also enable language models to perform safe, constrained actions on their behalf, increasing the usefulness of the system overall.\n\nWe expect that open standards will emerge to unify the ways in which applications expose an AI-facing interface. We are working on an early attempt at what such a standard might look like, and we\u2019re looking for feedback from developers interested in building with us.\n\nToday, we\u2019re beginning to gradually enable existing plugins from our early collaborators for ChatGPT users, beginning with ChatGPT Plus subscribers. We\u2019re also beginning to roll out the ability for developers to create their own plugins for ChatGPT.\n\nIn the coming months, as we learn from deployment and continue to improve our safety systems, we\u2019ll iterate on this protocol, and we plan to enable developers using OpenAI models to integrate plugins into their own applications beyond ChatGPT.  \n\n## Safety and broader implications \n\nConnecting language models to external tools introduces new opportunities as well as significant new risks.\n\nPlugins offer the potential to tackle various challenges associated with large language models, including \u201challucinations,\u201d keeping up with recent events, and accessing (with permission) proprietary information sources. By integrating explicit access to external data\u2014such as up-to-date information online, code-based calculations, or custom plugin-retrieved information\u2014language models can strengthen their responses with evidence-based references.\n\nThese references not only enhance the model\u2019s utility but also enable users to assess the trustworthiness of the model\u2019s output and double-check its accuracy, potentially mitigating risks related to overreliance as discussed in our recent GPT-4 system card. Lastly, the value of plugins may go well beyond addressing existing limitations by helping users with a variety of new use cases, ranging from browsing product catalogs to booking flights or ordering food.\n\nAt the same time, there\u2019s a risk that plugins could increase safety challenges by taking harmful or unintended actions, increasing the capabilities of bad actors who would defraud, mislead, or abuse others. By increasing the range of possible applications, plugins may raise the risk of negative consequences from mistaken or misaligned actions taken by the model in new domains. From day one, these factors have guided the development of our plugin platform, and we have implemented several safeguards.\n\n> From day one, these factors have guided the development of our plugin platform, and we have implemented several safeguards.\n\nWe\u2019ve performed red-teaming exercises, both internally and with external collaborators, that have revealed a number of possible concerning scenarios.

The only information they can learn from is their training data. This information can be out-of-date and is one-size fits all across applications. Furthermore, the only thing language models can do out-of-the-box is emit text. This text can contain useful instructions, but to actually follow these instructions you need another process.\n\nThough not a perfect analogy, plugins can be \u201ceyes and ears\u201d for language models, giving them access to information that is too recent, too personal, or too specific to be included in the training data. In response to a user\u2019s explicit request, plugins can also enable language models to perform safe, constrained actions on their behalf, increasing the usefulness of the system overall.\n\nWe expect that open standards will emerge to unify the ways in which applications expose an AI-facing interface. We are working on an early attempt at what such a standard might look like, and we\u2019re looking for feedback from developers interested in building with us.\n\nToday, we\u2019re beginning to gradually enable existing plugins from our early collaborators for ChatGPT users, beginning with ChatGPT Plus subscribers. We\u2019re also beginning to roll out the ability for developers to create their own plugins for ChatGPT.\n\nIn the coming months, as we learn from deployment and continue to improve our safety systems, we\u2019ll iterate on this protocol, and we plan to enable developers using OpenAI models to integrate plugins into their own applications beyond ChatGPT.  \n\n## Safety and broader implications \n\nConnecting language models to external tools introduces new opportunities as well as significant \u301051\u2020new risks\u2020cdn.openai.com\u3011.\n\nPlugins offer the potential to tackle various challenges associated with large language models, including \u201challucinations,\u201d keeping up with recent events, and accessing (with permission) proprietary information sources. By integrating explicit access to external data\u2014such as up-to-date information online, code-based calculations, or custom plugin-retrieved information\u2014language models can strengthen their responses with evidence-based references.\n\nThese references not only enhance the model\u2019s utility but also enable users to assess the trustworthiness of the model\u2019s output and double-check its accuracy, potentially mitigating risks related to overreliance as discussed in our recent GPT-4 \u301051\u2020system card\u2020cdn.openai.com\u3011. Lastly, the value of plugins may go well beyond addressing existing limitations by helping users with a variety of new use cases, ranging from browsing product catalogs to booking flights or ordering food.\n\nAt the same time, there\u2019s a risk that plugins could increase safety challenges by taking harmful or unintended actions, increasing the capabilities of bad actors who would defraud, mislead, or abuse others. By increasing the range of possible applications, plugins may raise the risk of negative consequences from mistaken or misaligned actions taken by the model in new domains. From day one, these factors have guided the development of our plugin platform, and we have implemented several safeguards.\n\n> From day one, these factors have guided the development of our plugin platform, and we have implemented several safeguards.\n\nWe\u2019ve performed red-teaming exercises, both internally and with external collaborators, that have revealed a number of possible concerning scenarios. For example, our red teamers discovered ways for plugins\u2014if released without safeguards\u2014to perform sophisticated prompt injection, send fraudulent and spam emails, bypass safety restrictions, or misuse information sent to the plugin. We\u2019re using these findings to inform safety-by-design mitigations that restrict risky plugin behaviors and improve transparency of how and when they're operating as part of the user experience. We're also using these findings to inform our decision to gradually deploy access to plugins.\n\nIf you\u2019re a researcher interested in studying safety risks or mitigations in this area, we encourage you to make use of our \u301052\u2020Researcher\nVisible: 0% - 38%",

The only information they can learn from is their training data. This information can be out-of-date and is one-size fits all across applications. Furthermore, the only thing language models can do out-of-the-box is emit text. This text can contain useful instructions, but to actually follow these instructions you need another process.\n\nThough not a perfect analogy, plugins can be \u201ceyes and ears\u201d for language models, giving them access to information that is too recent, too personal, or too specific to be included in the training data. In response to a user\u2019s explicit request, plugins can also enable language models to perform safe, constrained actions on their behalf, increasing the usefulness of the system overall.\n\nWe expect that open standards will emerge to unify the ways in which applications expose an AI-facing interface. We are working on an early attempt at what such a standard might look like, and we\u2019re looking for feedback from developers interested in building with us.\n\nToday, we\u2019re beginning to gradually enable existing plugins from our early collaborators for ChatGPT users, beginning with ChatGPT Plus subscribers. We\u2019re also beginning to roll out the ability for developers to create their own plugins for ChatGPT.\n\nIn the coming months, as we learn from deployment and continue to improve our safety systems, we\u2019ll iterate on this protocol, and we plan to enable developers using OpenAI models to integrate plugins into their own applications beyond ChatGPT.  \n\n## Safety and broader implications \n\nConnecting language models to external tools introduces new opportunities as well as significant \u301051\u2020new risks\u2020cdn.openai.com\u3011.\n\nPlugins offer the potential to tackle various challenges associated with large language models, including \u201challucinations,\u201d keeping up with recent events, and accessing (with permission) proprietary information sources. By integrating explicit access to external data\u2014such as up-to-date information online, code-based calculations, or custom plugin-retrieved information\u2014language models can strengthen their responses with evidence-based references.\n\nThese references not only enhance the model\u2019s utility but also enable users to assess the trustworthiness of the model\u2019s output and double-check its accuracy, potentially mitigating risks related to overreliance as discussed in our recent GPT-4 \u301051\u2020system card\u2020cdn.openai.com\u3011. Lastly, the value of plugins may go well beyond addressing existing limitations by helping users with a variety of new use cases, ranging from browsing product catalogs to booking flights or ordering food.\n\nAt the same time, there\u2019s a risk that plugins could increase safety challenges by taking harmful or unintended actions, increasing the capabilities of bad actors who would defraud, mislead, or abuse others. By increasing the range of possible applications, plugins may raise the risk of negative consequences from mistaken or misaligned actions taken by the model in new domains. From day one, these factors have guided the development of our plugin platform, and we have implemented several safeguards.\n\n> From day one, these factors have guided the development of our plugin platform, and we have implemented several safeguards.\n\nWe\u2019ve performed red-teaming exercises, both internally and with external collaborators, that have revealed a number of possible concerning scenarios. For example, our red teamers discovered ways for plugins\u2014if released without safeguards\u2014to perform sophisticated prompt injection, send fraudulent and spam emails, bypass safety restrictions, or misuse information sent to the plugin. We\u2019re using these findings to inform safety-by-design mitigations that restrict risky plugin behaviors and improve transparency of how and when they're operating as part of the user experience. We're also using these findings to inform our decision to gradually deploy access to plugins.\n\nIf you\u2019re a researcher interested in studying safety risks or mitigations in this area, we encourage you to make use of our \u301052\u2020Researcher\nVisible: 0% - 38%",

We\u2019re also beginning to roll out the ability for developers to create their own plugins for ChatGPT.\n\nIn the coming months, as we learn from deployment and continue to improve our safety systems, we\u2019ll iterate on this protocol, and we plan to enable developers using OpenAI models to integrate plugins into their own applications beyond ChatGPT.  \n\n## Safety and broader implications \n\nConnecting language models to external tools introduces new opportunities as well as significant new risks.\n\nPlugins offer the potential to tackle various challenges associated with large language models, including \u201challucinations,\u201d keeping up with recent events, and accessing (with permission) proprietary information sources. By integrating explicit access to external data\u2014such as up-to-date information online, code-based calculations, or custom plugin-retrieved information\u2014language models can strengthen their responses with evidence-based references.\n\nThese references not only enhance the model\u2019s utility but also enable users to assess the trustworthiness of the model\u2019s output and double-check its accuracy, potentially mitigating risks related to overreliance as discussed in our recent GPT-4 system card. Lastly, the value of plugins may go well beyond addressing existing limitations by helping users with a variety of new use cases, ranging from browsing product catalogs to booking flights or ordering food.\n\nAt the same time, there\u2019s a risk that plugins could increase safety challenges by taking harmful or unintended actions, increasing the capabilities of bad actors who would defraud, mislead, or abuse others. By increasing the range of possible applications, plugins may raise the risk of negative consequences from mistaken or misaligned actions taken by the model in new domains. From day one, these factors have guided the development of our plugin platform, and we have implemented several safeguards.\n\n> From day one, these factors have guided the development of our plugin platform, and we have implemented several safeguards.\n\nWe\u2019ve performed red-teaming exercises, both internally and with external collaborators, that have revealed a number of possible concerning scenarios. For example, our red teamers discovered ways for plugins\u2014if released without safeguards\u2014to perform sophisticated prompt injection, send fraudulent and spam emails, bypass safety restrictions, or misuse information sent to the plugin. We\u2019re using these findings to inform safety-by-design mitigations that restrict risky plugin behaviors and improve transparency of how and when they're operating as part of the user experience. We're also using these findings to inform our decision to gradually deploy access to plugins.\n\nIf you\u2019re a researcher interested in studying safety risks or mitigations in this area, we encourage you to make use of our Researcher\nVisible: 0% - 38%",

The only information they can learn from is their training data. This information can be out-of-date and is one-size fits all across applications. Furthermore, the only thing language models can do out-of-the-box is emit text. This text can contain useful instructions, but to actually follow these instructions you need another process.\n\nThough not a perfect analogy, plugins can be \u201ceyes and ears\u201d for language models, giving them access to information that is too recent, too personal, or too specific to be included in the training data. In response to a user\u2019s explicit request, plugins can also enable language models to perform safe, constrained actions on their behalf, increasing the usefulness of the system overall.\n\nWe expect that open standards will emerge to unify the ways in which applications expose an AI-facing interface. We are working on an early attempt at what such a standard might look like, and we\u2019re looking for feedback from developers interested in building with us.\n\nToday, we\u2019re beginning to gradually enable existing plugins from our early collaborators for ChatGPT users, beginning with ChatGPT Plus subscribers. We\u2019re also beginning to roll out the ability for developers to create their own plugins for ChatGPT.\n\nIn the coming months, as we learn from deployment and continue to improve our safety systems, we\u2019ll iterate on this protocol, and we plan to enable developers using OpenAI models to integrate plugins into their own applications beyond ChatGPT.  \n\n## Safety and broader implications \n\nConnecting language models to external tools introduces new opportunities as well as significant \u301051\u2020new risks\u2020cdn.openai.com\u3011.\n\nPlugins offer the potential to tackle various challenges associated with large language models, including \u201challucinations,\u201d keeping up with recent events, and accessing (with permission) proprietary information sources. By integrating explicit access to external data\u2014such as up-to-date information online, code-based calculations, or custom plugin-retrieved information\u2014language models can strengthen their responses with evidence-based references.\n\nThese references not only enhance the model\u2019s utility but also enable users to assess the trustworthiness of the model\u2019s output and double-check its accuracy, potentially mitigating risks related to overreliance as discussed in our recent GPT-4 \u301051\u2020system card\u2020cdn.openai.com\u3011. Lastly, the value of plugins may go well beyond addressing existing limitations by helping users with a variety of new use cases, ranging from browsing product catalogs to booking flights or ordering food.\n\nAt the same time, there\u2019s a risk that plugins could increase safety challenges by taking harmful or unintended actions, increasing the capabilities of bad actors who would defraud, mislead, or abuse others. By increasing the range of possible applications, plugins may raise the risk of negative consequences from mistaken or misaligned actions taken by the model in new domains. From day one, these factors have guided the development of our plugin platform, and we have implemented several safeguards.\n\n> From day one, these factors have guided the development of our plugin platform, and we have implemented several safeguards.\n\nWe\u2019ve performed red-teaming exercises, both internally and with external collaborators, that have revealed a number of possible concerning scenarios. For example, our red teamers discovered ways for plugins\u2014if released without safeguards\u2014to perform sophisticated prompt injection, send fraudulent and spam emails, bypass safety restrictions, or misuse information sent to the plugin. We\u2019re using these findings to inform safety-by-design mitigations that restrict risky plugin behaviors and improve transparency of how and when they're operating as part of the user experience. We're also using these findings to inform our decision to gradually deploy access to plugins.\n\nIf you\u2019re a researcher interested in studying safety risks or mitigations in this area, we encourage you to make use of our \u301052\u2020Researcher\nVisible: 0% - 38%",

We\u2019re starting with a small set of users and are planning to gradually roll out larger-scale access as we learn more (for plugin developers, ChatGPT users, and after an alpha period, API users who would like to integrate plugins into their products). We\u2019re excited to build a community shaping the future of the human\u2013AI interaction paradigm.\n\nPlugin developers who have been invited off our waitlist can use our documentation to build a plugin for ChatGPT, which then lists the enabled plugins in the prompt shown to the language model as well as documentation to instruct the model how to use each. The first plugins have been created by Expedia, FiscalNote, Instacart, KAYAK, Klarna, Milo, OpenTable, Shopify, Slack, Speak, Wolfram, and Zapier.\n\n[Image]\n\nExpedia Bring your trip plans to life\u2014get there, stay there, find things to see and do.\n\n[Image]\n\nFiscalNote Provides and enables access to select market-leading, real-time data sets for legal, political, and regulatory data and information.\n\n[Image]\n\nInstacart Order from your favorite local grocery stores.\n\n[Image]\n\nKAYAK Search for flights, stays and rental cars.

The only information they can learn from is their training data. This information can be out-of-date and is one-size fits all across applications. Furthermore, the only thing language models can do out-of-the-box is emit text. This text can contain useful instructions, but to actually follow these instructions you need another process.\n\nThough not a perfect analogy, plugins can be \u201ceyes and ears\u201d for language models, giving them access to information that is too recent, too personal, or too specific to be included in the training data. In response to a user\u2019s explicit request, plugins can also enable language models to perform safe, constrained actions on their behalf, increasing the usefulness of the system overall.\n\nWe expect that open standards will emerge to unify the ways in which applications expose an AI-facing interface. We are working on an early attempt at what such a standard might look like, and we\u2019re looking for feedback from developers interested in building with us.\n\nToday, we\u2019re beginning to gradually enable existing plugins from our early collaborators for ChatGPT users, beginning with ChatGPT Plus subscribers. We\u2019re also beginning to roll out the ability for developers to create their own plugins for ChatGPT.\n\nIn the coming months, as we learn from deployment and continue to improve our safety systems, we\u2019ll iterate on this protocol, and we plan to enable developers using OpenAI models to integrate plugins into their own applications beyond ChatGPT.  \n\n## Safety and broader implications \n\nConnecting language models to external tools introduces new opportunities as well as significant \u301051\u2020new risks\u2020cdn.openai.com\u3011.\n\nPlugins offer the potential to tackle various challenges associated with large language models, including \u201challucinations,\u201d keeping up with recent events, and accessing (with permission) proprietary information sources. By integrating explicit access to external data\u2014such as up-to-date information online, code-based calculations, or custom plugin-retrieved information\u2014language models can strengthen their responses with evidence-based references.\n\nThese references not only enhance the model\u2019s utility but also enable users to assess the trustworthiness of the model\u2019s output and double-check its accuracy, potentially mitigating risks related to overreliance as discussed in our recent GPT-4 \u301051\u2020system card\u2020cdn.openai.com\u3011. Lastly, the value of plugins may go well beyond addressing existing limitations by helping users with a variety of new use cases, ranging from browsing product catalogs to booking flights or ordering food.\n\nAt the same time, there\u2019s a risk that plugins could increase safety challenges by taking harmful or unintended actions, increasing the capabilities of bad actors who would defraud, mislead, or abuse others. By increasing the range of possible applications, plugins may raise the risk of negative consequences from mistaken or misaligned actions taken by the model in new domains. From day one, these factors have guided the development of our plugin platform, and we have implemented several safeguards.\n\n> From day one, these factors have guided the development of our plugin platform, and we have implemented several safeguards.\n\nWe\u2019ve performed red-teaming exercises, both internally and with external collaborators, that have revealed a number of possible concerning scenarios. For example, our red teamers discovered ways for plugins\u2014if released without safeguards\u2014to perform sophisticated prompt injection, send fraudulent and spam emails, bypass safety restrictions, or misuse information sent to the plugin. We\u2019re using these findings to inform safety-by-design mitigations that restrict risky plugin behaviors and improve transparency of how and when they're operating as part of the user experience. We're also using these findings to inform our decision to gradually deploy access to plugins.\n\nIf you\u2019re a researcher interested in studying safety risks or mitigations in this area, we encourage you to make use of our \u301052\u2020Researcher\nVisible: 0% - 38%",

We\u2019re starting with a small set of users and are planning to gradually roll out larger-scale access as we learn more (for plugin developers, ChatGPT users, and after an alpha period, API users who would like to integrate plugins into their products). We\u2019re excited to build a community shaping the future of the human\u2013AI interaction paradigm.\n\nPlugin developers who have been invited off our waitlist can use our \u301034\u2020documentation\u2020platform.openai.com\u3011 to build a plugin for ChatGPT, which then lists the enabled plugins in the prompt shown to the language model as well as documentation to instruct the model how to use each.

The only information they can learn from is their training data. This information can be out-of-date and is one-size fits all across applications. Furthermore, the only thing language models can do out-of-the-box is emit text. This text can contain useful instructions, but to actually follow these instructions you need another process.\n\nThough not a perfect analogy, plugins can be \u201ceyes and ears\u201d for language models, giving them access to information that is too recent, too personal, or too specific to be included in the training data. In response to a user\u2019s explicit request, plugins can also enable language models to perform safe, constrained actions on their behalf, increasing the usefulness of the system overall.\n\nWe expect that open standards will emerge to unify the ways in which applications expose an AI-facing interface. We are working on an early attempt at what such a standard might look like, and we\u2019re looking for feedback from developers interested in building with us.\n\nToday, we\u2019re beginning to gradually enable existing plugins from our early collaborators for ChatGPT users, beginning with ChatGPT Plus subscribers. We\u2019re also beginning to roll out the ability for developers to create their own plugins for ChatGPT.\n\nIn the coming months, as we learn from deployment and continue to improve our safety systems, we\u2019ll iterate on this protocol, and we plan to enable developers using OpenAI models to integrate plugins into their own applications beyond ChatGPT.  \n\n## Safety and broader implications \n\nConnecting language models to external tools introduces new opportunities as well as significant \u301051\u2020new risks\u2020cdn.openai.com\u3011.\n\nPlugins offer the potential to tackle various challenges associated with large language models, including \u201challucinations,\u201d keeping up with recent events, and accessing (with permission) proprietary information sources. By integrating explicit access to external data\u2014such as up-to-date information online, code-based calculations, or custom plugin-retrieved information\u2014language models can strengthen their responses with evidence-based references.\n\nThese references not only enhance the model\u2019s utility but also enable users to assess the trustworthiness of the model\u2019s output and double-check its accuracy, potentially mitigating risks related to overreliance as discussed in our recent GPT-4 \u301051\u2020system card\u2020cdn.openai.com\u3011. Lastly, the value of plugins may go well beyond addressing existing limitations by helping users with a variety of new use cases, ranging from browsing product catalogs to booking flights or ordering food.\n\nAt the same time, there\u2019s a risk that plugins could increase safety challenges by taking harmful or unintended actions, increasing the capabilities of bad actors who would defraud, mislead, or abuse others. By increasing the range of possible applications, plugins may raise the risk of negative consequences from mistaken or misaligned actions taken by the model in new domains. From day one, these factors have guided the development of our plugin platform, and we have implemented several safeguards.\n\n> From day one, these factors have guided the development of our plugin platform, and we have implemented several safeguards.\n\nWe\u2019ve performed red-teaming exercises, both internally and with external collaborators, that have revealed a number of possible concerning scenarios. For example, our red teamers discovered ways for plugins\u2014if released without safeguards\u2014to perform sophisticated prompt injection, send fraudulent and spam emails, bypass safety restrictions, or misuse information sent to the plugin. We\u2019re using these findings to inform safety-by-design mitigations that restrict risky plugin behaviors and improve transparency of how and when they're operating as part of the user experience. We're also using these findings to inform our decision to gradually deploy access to plugins.\n\nIf you\u2019re a researcher interested in studying safety risks or mitigations in this area, we encourage you to make use of our \u301052\u2020Researcher\nVisible: 0% - 38%",

We\u2019re starting with a small set of users and are planning to gradually roll out larger-scale access as we learn more (for plugin developers, ChatGPT users, and after an alpha period, API users who would like to integrate plugins into their products). We\u2019re excited to build a community shaping the future of the human\u2013AI interaction paradigm.\n\nPlugin developers who have been invited off our waitlist can use our documentation to build a plugin for ChatGPT, which then lists the enabled plugins in the prompt shown to the language model as well as documentation to instruct the model how to use each. The first plugins have been created by Expedia, FiscalNote, Instacart, KAYAK, Klarna, Milo, OpenTable, Shopify, Slack, Speak, Wolfram, and Zapier.\n\n[Image]\n\nExpedia Bring your trip plans to life\u2014get there, stay there, find things to see and do.\n\n[Image]\n\nFiscalNote Provides and enables access to select market-leading, real-time data sets for legal, political, and regulatory data and information.\n\n[Image]\n\nInstacart Order from your favorite local grocery stores.\n\n[Image]\n\nKAYAK Search for flights, stays and rental cars.

However, I can guide you through the process of creating a checklist in a document or spreadsheet based on the information you have.\n\nIf you're using a program like Microsoft Word or Google Docs, you can create a bulleted list to serve as a checklist. Here's a simple example based on the courses you asked about:\n\n1. Advanced Data Analytics\n2. Data Cleaning\n3. Predictive Modeling\n4. Exploratory Data Analysis\n5. The Data Analytics Journey\n6. Data Visualization - Representation and Reporting\n\nIn a spreadsheet program like Excel or Google Sheets, you could create a table with two columns. The first column would contain the name of each course, and the second column could be used to check off each course as it's completed.\n\nHere's an example of what that might look like:\n\n| Course                                   | Completed |\n|------------------------------------------|-----------|\n| Advanced Data Analytics                  |           |\n| Data Cleaning                            |           |\n| Predictive Modeling                      |           |\n| Exploratory Data Analysis                |           |\n| The Data Analytics Journey               |           |\n| Data Visualization - Representation and Reporting |           |\n\nIn either case, you would manually check off each item as it's completed. If you're using a digital document, you could do this by typing an \"X\" or some other indicator in the appropriate place. If you're using a physical document, you could check off each item with a pen or pencil.\n\nI hope this helps! If you need further assistance, feel free to ask."

You'll work in the browser version of Visual Studio Code, which is initially the default editor for GitHub Codespaces. After trying out this quickstart you can use Codespaces in other editors, and you can change the default editor. Links are provided at the end of this guide.\n\nFrom this quickstart, you'll learn how to create a codespace, connect to a forwarded port to view your running application, publish your codespace to a new repository, and personalize your setup with extensions.\n\nFor more information on exactly how GitHub Codespaces works, see the companion guide \"\u30107\u2020Deep dive into GitHub Codespaces\u3011.\"\n\n## \u301011\u2020Creating your codespace\u3011\n\n  1. Navigate to the \u301018\u2020github/haikus-for-codespaces\u2020github.com\u3011 template repository.\n\n  2. Click Use this template, then click Open in a codespace.\n\n[Image: Screenshot of the \"Use this template\" button and the dropdown menu expanded to show the \"Open in a codespace\" option.]\n\n## \u301012\u2020Running the application\u3011\n\nOnce your codespace is created, the template repository will be automatically cloned into it. Now you can run the application and launch it in a browser.\n\n  1. When the terminal becomes available, enter the command `npm run dev`. This example uses a Node.js project, and this command runs the script labeled \"dev\" in the `package.json` file, which starts up the web application defined in the sample repository.\n\n[Image: Screenshot of the Terminal in VS Code with the \"npm run dev\" command entered.]\n\nIf you're following along with a different application type, enter the corresponding start command for that project.\n\n  2. When your application starts, the codespace recognizes the port the application is running on and displays a pop-up message to let you know that the port has been forwarded.\n\n[Image: Screenshot of the pop-up message: \"Your application running on port 3000 is available.\" Below this is a green button, labeled \"Open in Browser.\"]\n\n  3. Click Open in Browser to view your running application in a new tab.\n\n## \u301013\u2020Edit the application and view changes\u3011\n\n  1. Switch back to your codespace and open the `haikus.json` file by clicking it in the Explorer.\n\n  2. Edit the `text` field of the first haiku to personalize the application with your own haiku.\n\n  3. Go back to the running application tab in your browser and refresh to see your changes.\n\nIf you've closed the browser tab, click the Ports tab in VS Code, hover over the Local Address value for the running port, and click the Open in Browser icon.\n\n[Image: Screenshot of the \"Ports\" panel. The \"Ports\" tab and a globe icon, which opens the forwarded port in a browser, are highlighted with orange outlines.]\n\n## \u301014\u2020Committing and pushing your changes\u3011\n\nNow that you've made a few changes, you can use the integrated terminal or the source view to publish your work to a new repository.\n\n  1. In the Activity Bar, click the Source Control view.\n\n[Image: Screenshot of the VS Code Activity Bar with the source control button highlighted with an orange outline.]\n\n  2. To stage your changes, click  next to the `haikus.json` file, or next to Changes if you've changed multiple files and you want to stage them all.\n\n[Image: Screenshot of the \"Source control\" side bar with the staging button (a plus sign), to the right of \"Changes,\" highlighted with a dark orange outline.]\n\n  3. To commit your staged changes, type a commit message describing the change you've made, then click Commit.\n\n[Image: Screenshot of the \"Source control\" side bar. A commit message, with \"Change haiku text and styles\" entered, and the \"Commit\" button are highlighted with an orange outline.]\n\n  4. Click Publish Branch.\n\n[Image: Screenshot of the \"Source control\" side bar showing the \"Publish Branch\" button.]\n\n  5. In the \"Repository Name\" dropdown, type a name for your new repository, then select Publish to GitHub private repository or Publish to GitHub public repository.\n\n[Image: Screenshot of the repository name dropdown in VS Code. Two options are shown, for publishing to a private or a public repository.]\n\nThe owner of the new repository will be the GitHub account with which you created the codespace.\n\n  6. In the pop-up that appears in the lower right corner of the editor, click Open on GitHub  to view the new repository on GitHub.com. In the new repository, view the `haikus.json` file and check that the change you made in your codespace has been successfully pushed to the repository.\n\n[Image: Screenshot of a confirmation message for a successfully published repository, showing the \"Open on GitHub\" button.]\n\n## \u301015\u2020Personalizing with an extension\u3011\n\nWhen you connect to a codespace using the browser, or the Visual Studio Code desktop application, you can access the Visual Studio Code Marketplace directly from the editor. For this example, you'll install a VS Code extension that alters the theme, but you can install any extension that's useful for your workflow.\n\n  1. In the Activity Bar, click the Extensions icon.\n\n[Image: Screenshot of the Activity Bar. The Extensions icon is highlighted with an orange outline.]\n\n  2. In the search bar, type `fairyfloss` and click Install.\n\n[Image: Screenshot of the \"Extensions: Marketplace\" side bar. \"fairyfloss\" is entered into the search box and, below it, the \"fairyfloss\" extension is displayed, with an \"Install\" button.]\n\n  3. Select the `fairyfloss` theme by selecting it from the list.\n\n[Image: Screenshot of the \"Select Color Theme\" dropdown, with the \"fairyfloss\" theme selected.]\n\n### \u301019\u2020About Settings Sync\u3011\n\nYou can enable Settings Sync to sync extensions and other settings across devices and instances of VS Code. Your synced settings are cached in the cloud. If Settings Sync is turned on in a codespace, any updates you make to your settings in the codespace are pushed to the cloud, and any updates you push to the cloud from elsewhere are pulled into your codespace.

You'll work in the browser version of Visual Studio Code, which is initially the default editor for GitHub Codespaces. After trying out this quickstart you can use Codespaces in other editors, and you can change the default editor. Links are provided at the end of this guide.\n\nFrom this quickstart, you'll learn how to create a codespace, connect to a forwarded port to view your running application, publish your codespace to a new repository, and personalize your setup with extensions.\n\nFor more information on exactly how GitHub Codespaces works, see the companion guide \"Deep dive into GitHub Codespaces.\"\n\n## Creating your codespace\n\n  1. Navigate to the github/haikus-for-codespaces template repository.\n\n  2. Click Use this template, then click Open in a codespace.\n\n[Image: Screenshot of the \"Use this template\" button and the dropdown menu expanded to show the \"Open in a codespace\" option.]\n\n## Running the application\n\nOnce your codespace is created, the template repository will be automatically cloned into it. Now you can run the application and launch it in a browser.\n\n  1. When the terminal becomes available, enter the command `npm run dev`. This example uses a Node.js project, and this command runs the script labeled \"dev\" in the `package.json` file, which starts up the web application defined in the sample repository.\n\n[Image: Screenshot of the Terminal in VS Code with the \"npm run dev\" command entered.]\n\nIf you're following along with a different application type, enter the corresponding start command for that project.\n\n  2. When your application starts, the codespace recognizes the port the application is running on and displays a pop-up message to let you know that the port has been forwarded.\n\n[Image: Screenshot of the pop-up message: \"Your application running on port 3000 is available.\" Below this is a green button, labeled \"Open in Browser.\"]\n\n  3. Click Open in Browser to view your running application in a new tab.\n\n## Edit the application and view changes\n\n  1. Switch back to your codespace and open the `haikus.json` file by clicking it in the Explorer.\n\n  2. Edit the `text` field of the first haiku to personalize the application with your own haiku.\n\n  3. Go back to the running application tab in your browser and refresh to see your changes.\n\nIf you've closed the browser tab, click the Ports tab in VS Code, hover over the Local Address value for the running port, and click the Open in Browser icon.\n\n[Image: Screenshot of the \"Ports\" panel. The \"Ports\" tab and a globe icon, which opens the forwarded port in a browser, are highlighted with orange outlines.]\n\n## Committing and pushing your changes\n\nNow that you've made a few changes, you can use the integrated terminal or the source view to publish your work to a new repository.\n\n  1. In the Activity Bar, click the Source Control view.\n\n[Image: Screenshot of the VS Code Activity Bar with the source control button highlighted with an orange outline.]\n\n  2. To stage your changes, click  next to the `haikus.json` file, or next to Changes if you've changed multiple files and you want to stage them all.\n\n[Image: Screenshot of the \"Source control\" side bar with the staging button (a plus sign), to the right of \"Changes,\" highlighted with a dark orange outline.]\n\n  3. To commit your staged changes, type a commit message describing the change you've made, then click Commit.\n\n[Image: Screenshot of the \"Source control\" side bar. A commit message, with \"Change haiku text and styles\" entered, and the \"Commit\" button are highlighted with an orange outline.]\n\n  4. Click Publish Branch.\n\n[Image: Screenshot of the \"Source control\" side bar showing the \"Publish Branch\" button.]\n\n  5. In the \"Repository Name\" dropdown, type a name for your new repository, then select Publish to GitHub private repository or Publish to GitHub public repository.\n\n[Image: Screenshot of the repository name dropdown in VS Code. Two options are shown, for publishing to a private or a public repository.]\n\nThe owner of the new repository will be the GitHub account with which you created the codespace.\n\n  6. In the pop-up that appears in the lower right corner of the editor, click Open on GitHub  to view the new repository on GitHub.com. In the new repository, view the `haikus.json` file and check that the change you made in your codespace has been successfully pushed to the repository.\n\n[Image: Screenshot of a confirmation message for a successfully published repository, showing the \"Open on GitHub\" button.]\n\n## Personalizing with an extension\n\nWhen you connect to a codespace using the browser, or the Visual Studio Code desktop application, you can access the Visual Studio Code Marketplace directly from the editor. For this example, you'll install a VS Code extension that alters the theme, but you can install any extension that's useful for your workflow.\n\n  1. In the Activity Bar, click the Extensions icon.\n\n[Image: Screenshot of the Activity Bar. The Extensions icon is highlighted with an orange outline.]\n\n  2. In the search bar, type `fairyfloss` and click Install.\n\n[Image: Screenshot of the \"Extensions: Marketplace\" side bar. \"fairyfloss\" is entered into the search box and, below it, the \"fairyfloss\" extension is displayed, with an \"Install\" button.]\n\n  3. Select the `fairyfloss` theme by selecting it from the list.\n\n[Image: Screenshot of the \"Select Color Theme\" dropdown, with the \"fairyfloss\" theme selected.]\n\n### About Settings Sync\n\nYou can enable Settings Sync to sync extensions and other settings across devices and instances of VS Code. Your synced settings are cached in the cloud. If Settings Sync is turned on in a codespace, any updates you make to your settings in the codespace are pushed to the cloud, and any updates you push to the cloud from elsewhere are pulled into your codespace. For more information, see \"Personalizing GitHub Codespaces for your account.\"\n\n## Next steps\n\nYou've successfully created, personalized, and run your first application within a codespace but there's so much more to explore!

template or choose a template specially designed for the type of work you want to do. @GitHub\n  * Opening an existing codespace You can reopen a codespace that you have closed or stopped and return to your work. @GitHub\n  * Personalizing GitHub Codespaces for your account You can personalize GitHub Codespaces by using a dotfiles repository on GitHub or by using Settings Sync. @GitHub\n  * Using GitHub Codespaces in Visual Studio Code You can develop in your codespace directly in Visual Studio Code by connecting the GitHub Codespaces extension with your account on GitHub. @GitHub\n  * Using GitHub Codespaces in your JetBrains IDE You can use the JetBrains Gateway to connect to your codespace and work in your favorite JetBrains IDE. @GitHub\n\nExplore guides \n\n## All GitHub Codespaces

Use the tabs in this article to display instructions for each of these ways of creating a codespace.\n\nYou can use GitHub Codespaces on your personal GitHub.com account, with the quota of free use included each month for accounts on the Free and Pro plans. You can continue using GitHub Codespaces beyond your monthly included storage and compute usage by providing payment details and setting a spending limit. For more information, see \"\u301032\u2020About billing for GitHub Codespaces\u3011.\"\n\nOrganizations can enable members and outside collaborators to create and use codespaces at the organization's expense. For more information, see \"\u301033\u2020Enabling GitHub Codespaces for your organization\u3011.\"\n\nYour ability to create codespaces from organization-owned repositories depends on several factors, including the repository's visibility and the settings of the organization or its parent enterprise. For more information, see \"\u301034\u2020Troubleshooting creation and deletion of codespaces\u3011.\"\n\nIf you're starting a new project, you might want to create a codespace from a template and publish to a repository on GitHub later. For more information, see \"\u30107\u2020Creating a codespace from a template\u3011.\"\n\nNote: If you use a JetBrains IDE, you can use GitHub CLI to create a codespace. You can then use the JetBrains Gateway application to open the codespace in a JetBrains IDE. For more information, see \"\u301021\u2020Using GitHub Codespaces in your JetBrains IDE\u3011.\"\n\nIf you create a codespace from a repository, the codespace will be associated with a specific branch, which cannot be empty. You can create more than one codespace per repository or even per branch.\n\nYou can see every available codespace that you have created at \u301035\u2020github.com/codespaces\u2020github.com\u3011.\n\n### \u301036\u2020The codespace creation process\u3011\n\nWhen you create a codespace, a number of steps happen to create and connect you to your development environment:\n\n  * Step 1: VM and storage are assigned to your codespace.\n  * Step 2: Container is created and your repository is cloned.\n  * Step 3: You can connect to the codespace.\n  * Step 4: Codespace continues with post-creation setup.\n\nFor more information on what happens when you create a codespace, see \"\u301037\u2020Deep dive into GitHub Codespaces\u3011.\"\n\nFor more information on the lifecycle of a codespace, see \"\u301038\u2020The codespace lifecycle\u3011.\"\n\nIf you want to use Git hooks for your codespace, then you should set up hooks using the `devcontainer.json` lifecycle scripts, such as `postCreateCommand`. These get executed during step 4, above. For information about the lifecycle scripts, see the \u301039\u2020dev containers specification\u2020containers.dev\u3011 on the Development Containers website. Since your codespace container is created after the repository is cloned, any \u301040\u2020git template directory\u2020git-scm.com\u3011 configured in the container image will not apply to your codespace. Hooks must instead be installed after the codespace is created.\n\nYou can edit code, debug, and use Git commands while developing in a codespace with VS Code. For more information, see the \u301041\u2020VS Code documentation\u2020code.visualstudio.com\u3011.\n\nTo speed up codespace creation, repository administrators can enable GitHub Codespaces prebuilds for a repository. For more information, see \"\u301042\u2020About GitHub Codespaces prebuilds\u3011.\"\n\n## \u301026\u2020Creating a codespace for a repository\u3011\n\n  1. On GitHub.com, navigate to the main page of the repository.\n\n  2. Under the repository name, select the branch dropdown menu, which is labeled with the name of the current branch, then click the branch you want to create a codespace for.\n\n[Image: Screenshot of the expanded branch dropdown menu, listing various branches. The dropdown menu, labeled with a branch icon and \"trunk,\" is highlighted with a dark orange outline.]\n\n  3. Click the  Code button, then click the Codespaces tab.\n\nA message is displayed at the bottom of the dialog telling you who will pay for the codespace.\n\n[Image: Screenshot of Codespaces dialog. The message showing who will pay for the codespace is highlighted with a dark orange outline.]\n\n  4. Create your codespace, either using the default options, or after configuring advanced options:\n\n    * Use the default options\n\nTo create a codespace using the default options, click .   \n\n    * Configure advanced options\n\nTo configure advanced options for your codespace, such as a different machine type or a particular `devcontainer.json` file:\n\n      1. At the top right of the Codespaces tab, select  and click New with options.\n\n[Image: Screenshot of the options dropdown in the \"Codespaces\" tab, with the option \"New with options\" highlighted.]\n\n      2. On the options page for your codespace, choose your preferred options from the dropdown menus.\n\n[Image: Screenshot of the advanced options page with buttons for \"Branch,\" \"Dev container configuration,\" \"Region,\" and \"Machine type.\"]\n\nThe options page may also display the names of one or more secrets that it's recommended you create in your Codespaces settings. For more information, see \"\u301027\u2020Recommended secrets\u3011.\"\n\nNotes\n\n        * You can bookmark the options page to give you a quick way to create a codespace for this repository and branch.\n        * The \u301043\u2020https://github.com/codespaces/new\u2020github.com\u3011 page provides a quick way to create a codespace for any repository and branch. You can get to this page quickly by typing `codespace.new` into your browser's address bar.\n        * For more information about dev container configuration files, see \"\u301044\u2020Introduction to dev containers\u3011.\"\n        * For more information about machine types, see \"\u301045\u2020Changing the machine type for your codespace\u3011.\"\n        * Your choice of available machine types may be limited by a number of factors. These can include a policy configured for your organization, or a minimum machine type specification for your repository. For more information, see \"\u301046\u2020Restricting access to machine types\u3011\" and \"\u301047\u2020Setting a minimum specification for codespace machines\u3011.\"\n\n      3. Click Create codespace.\n\n## \u301027\u2020Recommended secrets\u3011\n\nThe names of user-defined secrets may be displayed on the advanced options page when you create a codespace. This will happen if recommended secrets have been specified in the dev container configuration you have selected.\n\n[Image: Screenshot of the \"Create codespace\" page with four recommended secrets highlighted with a dark orange outline.]\n\nEntering values for these secrets, when you're prompted to do so, is recommended because it's likely your project will need values for these secrets. However, supplying values is not required for you to create a codespace. You can set these secrets within the codespace if you prefer.\n\nIf you enter a value for a recommended secret, the secret will available in the new codespace. When you click Create codespace, the secret is also added to your personal settings for Codespaces, so you will not need to enter a value for the secret in future when you create a codespace for this repository.\n\nIf the name of a secret is shown with a checkbox that is unavailable for selection, and no input box, this is because you already have a secret of this name configured in your personal settings for Codespaces, and you have associated it with this repository. If you've created a secret of this name but have not associated it with this repository, the checkbox will be available\nVisible: 0% - 64%",

Use the tabs in this article to display instructions for each of these ways of creating a codespace.\n\nYou can use GitHub Codespaces on your personal GitHub.com account, with the quota of free use included each month for accounts on the Free and Pro plans. You can continue using GitHub Codespaces beyond your monthly included storage and compute usage by providing payment details and setting a spending limit. For more information, see \"About billing for GitHub Codespaces.\"\n\nOrganizations can enable members and outside collaborators to create and use codespaces at the organization's expense. For more information, see \"Enabling GitHub Codespaces for your organization.\"\n\nYour ability to create codespaces from organization-owned repositories depends on several factors, including the repository's visibility and the settings of the organization or its parent enterprise. For more information, see \"Troubleshooting creation and deletion of codespaces.\"\n\nIf you're starting a new project, you might want to create a codespace from a template and publish to a repository on GitHub later. For more information, see \"Creating a codespace from a template.\"\n\nNote: If you use a JetBrains IDE, you can use GitHub CLI to create a codespace. You can then use the JetBrains Gateway application to open the codespace in a JetBrains IDE. For more information, see \"Using GitHub Codespaces in your JetBrains IDE.\"\n\nIf you create a codespace from a repository, the codespace will be associated with a specific branch, which cannot be empty. You can create more than one codespace per repository or even per branch.\n\nYou can see every available codespace that you have created at github.com/codespaces.\n\n### The codespace creation process\n\nWhen you create a codespace, a number of steps happen to create and connect you to your development environment:\n\n  * Step 1: VM and storage are assigned to your codespace.\n  * Step 2: Container is created and your repository is cloned.\n  * Step 3: You can connect to the codespace.\n  * Step 4: Codespace continues with post-creation setup.\n\nFor more information on what happens when you create a codespace, see \"Deep dive into GitHub Codespaces.\"\n\nFor more information on the lifecycle of a codespace, see \"The codespace lifecycle.\"\n\nIf you want to use Git hooks for your codespace, then you should set up hooks using the `devcontainer.json` lifecycle scripts, such as `postCreateCommand`. These get executed during step 4, above. For information about the lifecycle scripts, see the dev containers specification on the Development Containers website. Since your codespace container is created after the repository is cloned, any git template directory configured in the container image will not apply to your codespace. Hooks must instead be installed after the codespace is created.\n\nYou can edit code, debug, and use Git commands while developing in a codespace with VS Code. For more information, see the VS Code documentation.\n\nTo speed up codespace creation, repository administrators can enable GitHub Codespaces prebuilds for a repository. For more information, see \"About GitHub Codespaces prebuilds.\"\n\n## Creating a codespace for a repository\n\n  1. On GitHub.com, navigate to the main page of the repository.\n\n  2. Under the repository name, select the branch dropdown menu, which is labeled with the name of the current branch, then click the branch you want to create a codespace for.\n\n[Image: Screenshot of the expanded branch dropdown menu, listing various branches. The dropdown menu, labeled with a branch icon and \"trunk,\" is highlighted with a dark orange outline.]\n\n  3. Click the  Code button, then click the Codespaces tab.\n\nA message is displayed at the bottom of the dialog telling you who will pay for the codespace.\n\n[Image: Screenshot of Codespaces dialog. The message showing who will pay for the codespace is highlighted with a dark orange outline.]\n\n  4. Create your codespace, either using the default options, or after configuring advanced options:\n\n    * Use the default options\n\nTo create a codespace using the default options, click .   \n\n    * Configure advanced options\n\nTo configure advanced options for your codespace, such as a different machine type or a particular `devcontainer.json` file:\n\n      1. At the top right of the Codespaces tab, select  and click New with options.\n\n[Image: Screenshot of the options dropdown in the \"Codespaces\" tab, with the option \"New with options\" highlighted.]\n\n      2. On the options page for your codespace, choose your preferred options from the dropdown menus.\n\n[Image: Screenshot of the advanced options page with buttons for \"Branch,\" \"Dev container configuration,\" \"Region,\" and \"Machine type.\"]\n\nThe options page may also display the names of one or more secrets that it's recommended you create in your Codespaces settings. For more information, see \"Recommended secrets.\"\n\nNotes\n\n        * You can bookmark the options page to give you a quick way to create a codespace for this repository and branch.\n        * The https://github.com/codespaces/new page provides a quick way to create a codespace for any repository and branch. You can get to this page quickly by typing `codespace.new` into your browser's address bar.\n        * For more information about dev container configuration files, see \"Introduction to dev containers.\"\n        * For more information about machine types, see \"Changing the machine type for your codespace.\"\n        * Your choice of available machine types may be limited by a number of factors. These can include a policy configured for your organization, or a minimum machine type specification for your repository. For more information, see \"Restricting access to machine types\" and \"Setting a minimum specification for codespace machines.\"\n\n      3. Click Create codespace.\n\n## Recommended secrets\n\nThe names of user-defined secrets may be displayed on the advanced options page when you create a codespace. This will happen if recommended secrets have been specified in the dev container configuration you have selected.\n\n[Image: Screenshot of the \"Create codespace\" page with four recommended secrets highlighted with a dark orange outline.]\n\nEntering values for these secrets, when you're prompted to do so, is recommended because it's likely your project will need values for these secrets. However, supplying values is not required for you to create a codespace. You can set these secrets within the codespace if you prefer.\n\nIf you enter a value for a recommended secret, the secret will available in the new codespace. When you click Create codespace, the secret is also added to your personal settings for Codespaces, so you will not need to enter a value for the secret in future when you create a codespace for this repository.\n\nIf the name of a secret is shown with a checkbox that is unavailable for selection, and no input box, this is because you already have a secret of this name configured in your personal settings for Codespaces, and you have associated it with this repository. If you've created a secret of this name but have not associated it with this repository, the checkbox will be available\nVisible: 0% - 64%",

The Free and Pro plans for personal accounts include free use of GitHub Codespaces up to a fixed amount of usage every month.\n\nCharges are billed to an organization or enterprise when all of the following are true:\n\n  * The repository from which a codespace is started (or the parent repository, in the case of a forked repository) is owned by an organization.\n  * The organization is configured to be billed for codespaces created from the repository or forks of the repository.\n  * The user creating the codespace belongs to the organization, or is an outside collaborator affiliated with the organization, and the organization has chosen to pay for this user's use of organization-owned codespaces.\n\nOtherwise use of GitHub Codespaces applies to the personal account of the person who created the codespace, and either consumes some of the monthly included usage for their personal account, or their account is billed according to their usage in excess of their included quotas.\n\nFor information about how to configure an organization to be billed for codespace usage, see \"\u301020\u2020Enabling GitHub Codespaces for your organization\u3011.\" The Free, Team, and Enterprise plans for organization and enterprise accounts do not include any free use of GitHub Codespaces.\n\n## \u30108\u2020Monthly included storage and core hours for personal accounts\u3011\n\nThe following storage and core hours of usage are included, free of charge, for personal accounts:\n\nAccount plan Storage per month Core hours per month   \nGitHub Free for personal accounts 15 GB-month 120   \nGitHub Pro 20 GB-month 180  \n\nNotes\n\n  * The GB-month unit of storage is a time-based measurement, 1 GB-month being 1 GB of storage usage for one whole month. The disk space used by all of your codespaces and prebuilds is assessed once an hour and your current GB-month usage is recalculated. Therefore, while you have codespaces and prebuilds, your GB-month usage will increase throughout the month. For example, if the storage totals 15 GB, and remains unchanged throughout your monthly billing cycle, then you will have used 7.5 GB halfway through the month, and 15 GB at the end of the month. For more information, see \"\u301012\u2020About billing for storage usage\u3011\" later in this article.\n  * A \"core hour\" is a measure used for included compute usage. To calculate core hours, multiply the number of hours for which a codespace has been active by the multiplier in the pricing table later in this article. For the basic machine types, the multiplier is the number of processor cores in the machine that hosts the codespace. For example, if you use a 2-core machine for your codespace and it's active for an hour, you have used 2 core hours. If you use an 8-core machine for an hour, you have used 8 core hours. If you use an 8-core machine for two hours, you have used 16 core hours.\n\nYou will be notified by email when you have used 75%, 90%, and 100% of your included quotas. Notifications are also displayed in a \"toast\" message within VS Code and the VS Code web client. You can turn off email notifications if required. For more information, see \"\u301021\u2020Managing the spending limit for GitHub Codespaces\u3011.\"\n\nWhen a personal account has used all of either the included storage or compute usage (whichever is reached first), and has no spending limit configured, use of GitHub Codespaces will be blocked. You must set up a payment method and a spending limit to continue using GitHub Codespaces during the current billing month. At the beginning of the next monthly billing cycle the included usage is reset.

For more information, see \"\u30105\u2020Viewing your GitHub Codespaces usage\u3011.\"\n\nIf you are blocked from resuming a codespace and you want to continue to work on changes you have made in your codespace, you can do any of the following:\n\n  * Add a payment method and a spending limit greater than $0 USD.\n  * Export the changes from the codespace to a branch. For more information, see \"\u301022\u2020Exporting changes to a branch\u3011.\"\n  * Wait for your monthly included usage to reset at the start of the next monthly billing cycle.\n\nIf you have used all of either your included storage usage or your included compute usage, and you have set up a payment method and a spending limit, any further use of codespaces owned by your personal account will incur charges for whichever type of usage has no remaining included quota.

Costs for GitHub Codespaces are always billed monthly, even if your account is otherwise billed annually.\n\nBilling for GitHub Codespaces shares your account's existing payment method, and receipt. For more information, see \"\u301024\u2020Viewing your subscriptions and billing date\u3011.\"\n\nIf you are an organization owner, you can connect an Azure Subscription ID to your organization account to enable and pay for GitHub Codespaces usage. For more information, see \"\u301025\u2020Connecting an Azure subscription\u3011.\"\n\n## \u301011\u2020About billing for compute usage\u3011\n\nThe compute usage of a codespace is the length of time for which that codespace is active multiplied by the multiplier in the pricing table for the machine type of the codespace. Total compute usage is calculated by summing the time used by all codespaces billable to a particular account. These totals are reported to the billing service every hour, and are billed monthly.\n\nAs an example, if a codespace is active for 1 hour and 15 minutes, then the compute cost will be the hourly cost of the codespace, as determined by its machine type, multiplied by 1.25.\n\nYou can control compute usage by stopping your codespaces.

The Free and Pro plans for personal accounts include free use of GitHub Codespaces up to a fixed amount of usage every month.\n\nCharges are billed to an organization or enterprise when all of the following are true:\n\n  * The repository from which a codespace is started (or the parent repository, in the case of a forked repository) is owned by an organization.\n  * The organization is configured to be billed for codespaces created from the repository or forks of the repository.\n  * The user creating the codespace belongs to the organization, or is an outside collaborator affiliated with the organization, and the organization has chosen to pay for this user's use of organization-owned codespaces.\n\nOtherwise use of GitHub Codespaces applies to the personal account of the person who created the codespace, and either consumes some of the monthly included usage for their personal account, or their account is billed according to their usage in excess of their included quotas.\n\nFor information about how to configure an organization to be billed for codespace usage, see \"Enabling GitHub Codespaces for your organization.\" The Free, Team, and Enterprise plans for organization and enterprise accounts do not include any free use of GitHub Codespaces.\n\n## Monthly included storage and core hours for personal accounts\n\nThe following storage and core hours of usage are included, free of charge, for personal accounts:\n\nAccount plan Storage per month Core hours per month   \nGitHub Free for personal accounts 15 GB-month 120   \nGitHub Pro 20 GB-month 180  \n\nNotes\n\n  * The GB-month unit of storage is a time-based measurement, 1 GB-month being 1 GB of storage usage for one whole month. The disk space used by all of your codespaces and prebuilds is assessed once an hour and your current GB-month usage is recalculated. Therefore, while you have codespaces and prebuilds, your GB-month usage will increase throughout the month. For example, if the storage totals 15 GB, and remains unchanged throughout your monthly billing cycle, then you will have used 7.5 GB halfway through the month, and 15 GB at the end of the month. For more information, see \"About billing for storage usage\" later in this article.\n  * A \"core hour\" is a measure used for included compute usage. To calculate core hours, multiply the number of hours for which a codespace has been active by the multiplier in the pricing table later in this article. For the basic machine types, the multiplier is the number of processor cores in the machine that hosts the codespace. For example, if you use a 2-core machine for your codespace and it's active for an hour, you have used 2 core hours. If you use an 8-core machine for an hour, you have used 8 core hours. If you use an 8-core machine for two hours, you have used 16 core hours.\n\nYou will be notified by email when you have used 75%, 90%, and 100% of your included quotas. Notifications are also displayed in a \"toast\" message within VS Code and the VS Code web client. You can turn off email notifications if required. For more information, see \"Managing the spending limit for GitHub Codespaces.\"\n\nWhen a personal account has used all of either the included storage or compute usage (whichever is reached first), and has no spending limit configured, use of GitHub Codespaces will be blocked. You must set up a payment method and a spending limit to continue using GitHub Codespaces during the current billing month. At the beginning of the next monthly billing cycle the included usage is reset. Storage will not be billed while use of GitHub Codespaces is blocked.\n\nYou can view details of your usage for the current month at any time. For more information, see \"Viewing your GitHub Codespaces usage.\"\n\nIf you are blocked from resuming a codespace and you want to continue to work on changes you have made in your codespace, you can do any of the following:\n\n  * Add a payment method and a spending limit greater than $0 USD.\n  * Export the changes from the codespace to a branch. For more information, see \"Exporting changes to a branch.\"\n  * Wait for your monthly included usage to reset at the start of the next monthly billing cycle.\n\nIf you have used all of either your included storage usage or your included compute usage, and you have set up a payment method and a spending limit, any further use of codespaces owned by your personal account will incur charges for whichever type of usage has no remaining included quota. You will not be charged for the other type of usage until you have also used all of its included quota.\n\nFor tips on making your allowed usage go further, see \"Getting the most out of your included usage.\"\n\n## Pricing for paid usage\n\nA GitHub Codespaces instance (a \"codespace\") incurs charges for compute time, while it is active, and for the amount of disk space the codespace occupies, while it exists.

The Free and Pro plans for personal accounts include free use of GitHub Codespaces up to a fixed amount of usage every month.\n\nCharges are billed to an organization or enterprise when all of the following are true:\n\n  * The repository from which a codespace is started (or the parent repository, in the case of a forked repository) is owned by an organization.\n  * The organization is configured to be billed for codespaces created from the repository or forks of the repository.\n  * The user creating the codespace belongs to the organization, or is an outside collaborator affiliated with the organization, and the organization has chosen to pay for this user's use of organization-owned codespaces.\n\nOtherwise use of GitHub Codespaces applies to the personal account of the person who created the codespace, and either consumes some of the monthly included usage for their personal account, or their account is billed according to their usage in excess of their included quotas.\n\nFor information about how to configure an organization to be billed for codespace usage, see \"\u301020\u2020Enabling GitHub Codespaces for your organization\u3011.\" The Free, Team, and Enterprise plans for organization and enterprise accounts do not include any free use of GitHub Codespaces.\n\n## \u30108\u2020Monthly included storage and core hours for personal accounts\u3011\n\nThe following storage and core hours of usage are included, free of charge, for personal accounts:\n\nAccount plan Storage per month Core hours per month   \nGitHub Free for personal accounts 15 GB-month 120   \nGitHub Pro 20 GB-month 180  \n\nNotes\n\n  * The GB-month unit of storage is a time-based measurement, 1 GB-month being 1 GB of storage usage for one whole month. The disk space used by all of your codespaces and prebuilds is assessed once an hour and your current GB-month usage is recalculated. Therefore, while you have codespaces and prebuilds, your GB-month usage will increase throughout the month. For example, if the storage totals 15 GB, and remains unchanged throughout your monthly billing cycle, then you will have used 7.5 GB halfway through the month, and 15 GB at the end of the month. For more information, see \"\u301012\u2020About billing for storage usage\u3011\" later in this article.\n  * A \"core hour\" is a measure used for included compute usage. To calculate core hours, multiply the number of hours for which a codespace has been active by the multiplier in the pricing table later in this article. For the basic machine types, the multiplier is the number of processor cores in the machine that hosts the codespace. For example, if you use a 2-core machine for your codespace and it's active for an hour, you have used 2 core hours. If you use an 8-core machine for an hour, you have used 8 core hours. If you use an 8-core machine for two hours, you have used 16 core hours.\n\nYou will be notified by email when you have used 75%, 90%, and 100% of your included quotas. Notifications are also displayed in a \"toast\" message within VS Code and the VS Code web client. You can turn off email notifications if required. For more information, see \"\u301021\u2020Managing the spending limit for GitHub Codespaces\u3011.\"\n\nWhen a personal account has used all of either the included storage or compute usage (whichever is reached first), and has no spending limit configured, use of GitHub Codespaces will be blocked. You must set up a payment method and a spending limit to continue using GitHub Codespaces during the current billing month. At the beginning of the next monthly billing cycle the included usage is reset. Storage will not be billed while use of GitHub Codespaces is blocked.\n\nYou can view details of your usage for the current month at any time. For more information, see \"\u30105\u2020Viewing your GitHub Codespaces usage\u3011.\"\n\nIf you are blocked from resuming a codespace and you want to continue to work on changes you have made in your codespace, you can do any of the following:\n\n  * Add a payment method and a spending limit greater than $0 USD.\n  * Export the changes from the codespace to a branch. For more information, see \"\u301022\u2020Exporting changes to a branch\u3011.\"\n  * Wait for your monthly included usage to reset at the start of the next monthly billing cycle.\n\nIf you have used all of either your included storage usage or your included compute usage, and you have set up a payment method and a spending limit, any further use of codespaces owned by your personal account will incur charges for whichever type of usage has no remaining included quota. You will not be charged for the other type of usage until you have also used all of its included quota.\n\nFor tips on making your allowed usage go further, see \"\u301023\u2020Getting the most out of your included usage\u3011.\"\n\n## \u30109\u2020Pricing for paid usage\u3011\n\nA GitHub Codespaces instance (a \"codespace\") incurs charges for compute time, while it is active, and for the amount of disk space the codespace occupies, while it exists. The compute cost is proportional to the number of processor cores in the machine type you choose for your codespace, as shown in the following table. For example, the compute cost of using a codespace for an hour on a 16-core machine is eight times greater than a 2-core machine.\n\nComponent Machine type Unit of measure Included usage multiplier Price   \nCodespaces compute 2 core 1 hour 2$0.18   \nCodespaces compute 4 core 1 hour 4$0.36   \nCodespaces compute 8 core 1 hour 8$0.72   \nCodespaces compute 16 core 1 hour 16$1.44   \nCodespaces compute 32 core 1 hour 32$2.88   \nCodespaces storage Storage 1 GB-month Not applicable$0.07  \n\nFor more information about the GB-month unit of measure, see \"\u301012\u2020About billing for storage usage\u3011.\"\n\nIf you enable prebuilding of codespaces this will incur additional charges. For more information, see \"\u301013\u2020About billing for Codespaces prebuilds\u3011.\"\n\n## \u301010\u2020About your bill for GitHub Codespaces\u3011\n\nGitHub Codespaces is billed in US dollars (USD) according to the amount of compute time and storage space your codespaces use. Costs for GitHub Codespaces are always billed monthly, even if your account is otherwise billed annually.\n\nBilling for GitHub Codespaces shares your account's existing payment method, and receipt. For more information, see \"\u301024\u2020Viewing your subscriptions and billing date\u3011.\"\n\nIf you are an organization owner, you can connect an Azure Subscription ID to your organization account to enable and pay for GitHub Codespaces usage. For more information, see \"\u301025\u2020Connecting an Azure subscription\u3011.\"\n\n## \u301011\u2020About billing for compute usage\u3011\n\nThe compute usage of a codespace is the length of time for which that codespace is active multiplied by the multiplier in the pricing table for the machine type of the codespace. Total compute usage is calculated by summing the time used by all codespaces billable to a particular account. These totals are reported to the billing service every hour, and are billed monthly.\n\nAs an example, if a codespace is active for 1 hour and 15 minutes, then the compute cost will be the hourly cost of the codespace, as determined by its machine type, multiplied by 1.25.\n\nYou can control compute usage by stopping your codespaces. For information, see \"\u301026\u2020Stopping and starting a codespace\u3011.\" Codespaces are stopped automatically after a configurable period of inactivity. The timeout period can be configured by the user, or at the organization level. For more information, see \"\u301027\u2020Setting your timeout period for GitHub Codespaces\u3011\" and \"\u301028\u2020Restricting the idle timeout period\u3011.\"\n\n## \u301012\u2020About billing for storage usage\u3011\n\nFor GitHub Codespaces billing purposes, storage comprises the disk space used by all of the codespaces and prebuilds in your account. This includes any files you use in a codespace, such as cloned repositories, configuration files, data loaded to the codespace (for example as input or output of the software running in the repository), and extensions, among others. Storage is billed for all of your existing codespaces, regardless of whether they are active or inactive with the exception of\nVisible: 3% - 45%",

From my current knowledge, once you are done editing your files in GitHub Codespaces, you would typically follow the standard git process: \n\n1. `git add .` to stage the changes you have made. \n2. `git commit -m \"Your message here\"` to commit these changes with an appropriate message. \n3. `git push origin your-branch-name` to push these changes to the branch you are working on in your GitHub repository.\n\nHowever, I was unable to find specific documentation or guides related to this during the browsing session. I recommend referring to GitHub's official documentation or help forums for the most accurate information. \n\nIf you have further questions or need assistance with anything else, feel free to ask!"

Using square brackets:\n\n```python\ndf['column_name']\n```\n\n2. Using the dot operator, which only works if the column name doesn't contain spaces or special characters:\n\n```python\ndf.column_name\n```\n\nHere is an example:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Create a simple dataframe\ndata = {\n    'Name': ['"

Here is an example:\n\n```python\n# Select two columns\nselected_columns = df[['column_name1', 'column_name2']]\n```\n\nIn this example, `column_name1` and `column_name2` are the names of the columns you want to select. You would replace these with the names of the columns you're interested in.\n\nThe result of this operation is a new DataFrame that only contains the selected columns. For instance, if your original DataFrame (`df`) looks like this:\n\n```\n   column_name1  column_name2  column_name3\n0            1             4             7\n1            2             5             8\n2            3             6             9\n```\n\nAfter selecting `column_name1` and `column_name2`, the new DataFrame (`selected_columns`) would look like this:\n\n```\n   column_name1  column_name2\n0            1             4\n1            2             5\n2            3             6\n```\n\nIn this way, you can select as many columns as you want from a DataFrame without selecting all of them."

On the other hand, if you set `inplace=False` (or if you don't provide this parameter, since `False` is the default value), the function will return a new DataFrame and the original DataFrame will remain unchanged.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# create a DataFrame\ndf = pd.DataFrame({\n   'A': [1, 2, 3],\n   'B': [4, 5, 6],\n})\n\nprint(df)\n\ndf.replace(1, 10, inplace=True)\n\nprint(df)\n```\n\nIn this example, after calling `replace(1, 10, inplace=True)` on the DataFrame, the original DataFrame `df` is modified:\n\n```\n   A  B\n0  1  4\n1  2  5\n2  3  6\n\n   A  B\n0 10  4\n1  2  5\n2  3  6\n```\n\nBut if you used `inplace=False`:\n\n```python\ndf2 = df.replace(1, 10, inplace=False)\n\nprint(df)\nprint(df2)\n```\n\n`df` remains unchanged, and the replacement is performed in the new DataFrame `df2`:\n\n```\n   A  B\n0  1  4\n1  2  5\n2  3  6\n\n   A  B\n0 10  4\n1  2  5\n2  3  6\n```"

                            "Alright, based on the ingredients you've mentioned, I propose a BBQ Chicken & Andouille Sausage Quinoa Bowl. Here's a recipe:\n\n**BBQ Chicken & Andouille Sausage Quinoa Bowl**\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n- 1 Andouille sausage\n- 2 Chicken breasts\n- 1 cup Quinoa\n- 1 large Jersey sweet potato\n- 1 can Crushed tomatoes\n- 1 cup BBQ sauce\n- 1 cup Frozen spinach\n- 1 cup Frozen broccoli\n- 1 cup of your choice of legumes (e.g. black beans, chickpeas, lentils)\n- Salt, pepper, and other spices to taste (garlic powder, onion powder, smoked paprika would work well here)\n- Olive oil for saut\u00e9ing\n\n**Directions:**\n\n1. Start by cooking your quinoa. Rinse the quinoa under cold water and drain. Add 2 cups of water to a pot, bring it to a boil, add your quinoa and reduce heat. Simmer until the quinoa is tender and the water has absorbed, about 15-20 minutes.\n\n2. While your quinoa is cooking, cube your chicken breasts and andouille sausage. Also peel and cube your sweet potato into bite-sized pieces.\n\n3. Heat a large skillet with a drizzle of olive oil over medium-high heat. Add your chicken and sausage to the pan and cook until the chicken is cooked through and the sausage is nicely browned.\n\n4. Remove the meat from the pan and set aside. In the same pan, add a bit more olive oil if needed and add your sweet potatoes. Cook until they are tender and slightly caramelized.\n\n5. While your sweet potatoes are cooking, defrost your frozen spinach and broccoli. You can do this in the microwave according to the package instructions.\n\n6. When your sweet potatoes are done, add the crushed tomatoes, BBQ sauce, and legumes to the pan. Stir well and let this simmer for a few minutes until it's heated through.\n\n7. Now add back in your chicken and sausage, along with your defrosted spinach and broccoli. Stir well and let everything cook together for a few more minutes.\n\n8. Taste and adjust the seasoning as needed.\n\n9. To serve, spoon a generous amount of quinoa into bowls and top with the BBQ chicken, sausage, and vegetable mixture.\n\nEnjoy your hearty, homemade BBQ Chicken & Andouille Sausage Quinoa Bowl! This is a very flexible recipe, so feel free to adjust according to your tastes or what you have available."

Therefore, to cook 1 pound of quinoa, you would use about 4.5 cups of water. \n\nHere's a simple method:\n\n1. Rinse the quinoa under cold water in a fine-mesh sieve until the water runs clear.\n2. Combine the rinsed quinoa and the water in a pot.\n3. Bring the mixture to a boil over medium-high heat, then decrease the heat to maintain a gentle simmer. Cook until the quinoa has absorbed all of the water, about 15 to 20 minutes. \n4. Remove the pot from heat, cover, and let the quinoa steam for 5 minutes. This step gives the quinoa time to pop open and the beautiful spiral appears.\n5. After 5 minutes, remove the lid and fluff the quinoa gently with a fork. \n\nRemember, these ratios and times can be slightly different depending on the specific brand of quinoa, so it's always a good idea to check the package instructions too."

                            "I have severe executive function disorder and ADD. I need non-medical advice on how to motivate myself to work. The tricky part is, my favorite thing to do, literally, is to learn and work on problems. When I have free time and energy it is all I want to do. Learning and working is like heaven to me. \nBut then I get thrown to the opposite end of the spectrum. Where I simply can't work. My brain can't organize the motivation. It's like work and learning goes from my favorite things to do, and easy to do enthusiastically, to impossible to do. It like going colorblind or dyslexic or paralyzed out of nowhere. Nothin I do can motivate me to engage. It seems like an insurmountable task and I become so overwhelmed and distracted.  I still WANT to do the work, I WANT to learn, but I become mentally paralyzed and get stressed thinking about starting. It is horrible and makes me sad. I need tools in my productivity toolbelt to help me \"get back into\" when I am having difficult times. Because when it gets bad, ANY work because impossible for my brain to wrap itself around to get going. It is really crippling. \nPeople often tell me to start small, or use a reminder, or an app. But they are missing the point, I can overcome the fear to use those either. Please advice as best you can.\n\n\n"

                            "I'm sorry to hear about the struggles you're facing. It's clear that you're passionate about learning and problem-solving, but the challenges posed by executive function disorder and ADD can make it difficult to maintain consistent productivity. Here are some strategies that might help:\n\n1. **Break Tasks Down**: This is a common piece of advice, but it's worth repeating. When you're feeling overwhelmed, try to break your tasks down into the smallest possible steps. This might mean breaking a task down into steps that seem absurdly small, but that's okay. The goal is to make each step feel manageable.\n\n2. **Visualize Success**: Before you start working on a task, take a moment to visualize yourself successfully completing it. This can help to reduce the anxiety and overwhelm you feel when you think about starting the task.\n\n3. **Mindfulness and Meditation**: Mindfulness exercises and meditation can help to reduce stress and anxiety, and can improve focus and attention. There are many apps and online resources available that can guide you through these exercises.\n\n4. **Physical Activity**: Regular physical activity can help to reduce symptoms of ADD and improve executive function. This doesn't necessarily mean you need to start a rigorous exercise routine - even a short walk can be beneficial.\n\n5. **Create a Routine**: Having a consistent daily routine can help to reduce the cognitive load of decision-making and can make it easier to start tasks. Try to create a routine that includes regular times for work, rest, meals, and physical activity.\n\n6. **Use External Tools**: Even though you mentioned that using reminders or apps can be challenging, there are some tools that might be helpful. For example, a visual timer can help you to see how much time you have left to work on a task, which can make the task feel more manageable. There are also apps that can help you to break tasks down into smaller steps, or that can guide you through mindfulness exercises.\n\n7. **Seek Support**: Consider seeking support from a coach or therapist who specializes in executive function disorder and ADD. They can provide personalized strategies and support to help you manage your symptoms.\n\n8. **Self-Compassion**: It's important to be kind to yourself and to recognize that what you're experiencing is a result of your disorder, not a personal failing. Try to celebrate your successes, no matter how small they might seem.\n\nRemember, it's okay to have bad days and it's okay to ask for help. You're not alone in this, and there are resources and strategies available that can help."

                            "Absolutely, I'd be happy to help you create a more specific plan. Let's take a few of the strategies I mentioned and break them down into more detailed steps. \n\n1. **Break Tasks Down**: \n    - Identify a task you need to complete.\n    - Write down every step involved in completing that task, no matter how small. For example, if the task is \"write a report,\" the steps might include \"choose a topic,\" \"research the topic,\" \"write an outline,\" \"write the introduction,\" etc.\n    - When you're ready to start working, focus only on the first step. Try to put the rest of the steps out of your mind for now.\n\n2. **Visualize Success**: \n    - Before you start working on a task, close your eyes and take a few deep breaths.\n    - Picture yourself starting the task. Visualize each step you need to take.\n    - Imagine yourself successfully completing the task. Picture how you'll feel when the task is done.\n\n3. **Mindfulness and Meditation**: \n    - Choose a time each day to practice mindfulness or meditation. This could be first thing in the morning, during a lunch break, or before bed.\n    - Use an app or online resource to guide you through a mindfulness exercise or meditation. Some popular options include Headspace, Calm, and Insight Timer.\n    - Try to make this a daily habit. Even a few minutes each day can be beneficial.\n\n4. **Physical Activity**: \n    - Choose a type of physical activity that you enjoy. This could be walking, running, yoga, dancing, etc.\n    - Schedule time each day for this activity. Try to make it a consistent part of your routine.\n    - If you're feeling overwhelmed or stuck, take a short break to move your body. Even a few minutes of physical activity can help to clear your mind.\n\n5. **Create a Routine**: \n    - Write down everything you need to do each day, including work tasks, meals, physical activity, rest, etc.\n    - Try to schedule these activities at the same time each day. This can help to create a sense of predictability and control.\n    - Be flexible with your routine. If something isn't working, it's okay to make changes.\n\n6. **Use External Tools**: \n    - Choose a tool or app to help you manage your tasks. This could be a visual timer, a to-do list app, a mindfulness app, etc.\n    - Spend some time learning how to use the tool or app. It might be helpful to watch tutorials or read user reviews to get a sense of how it works.\n    - Try to incorporate the tool or app into your daily routine.\n\n7. **Seek Support**: \n    - Research therapists or coaches in your area who specialize in executive function disorder and ADD.\n    - Schedule an appointment to discuss your symptoms and challenges.\n    - Be open and honest about your experiences. The more information you provide, the better they'll be able to help you.\n\n8. **Self-Compassion**: \n    - When you're feeling overwhelmed or frustrated, take a moment to remind yourself that what you're experiencing is not your fault.\n    - Celebrate your successes, no matter how small. This could be as simple as acknowledging to yourself that you did a good job, or you could reward yourself with a treat or a break.\n    - Try to be patient with yourself. Change takes time, and it's okay to have setbacks.\n\nRemember, these are just suggestions. Feel free to modify these steps to better suit your needs and preferences."

Children with traits which are undiagnosed may not receive effective support and are often identified as exhibiting challenging behaviour. In the UK, children with undiagnosed Special Educational Needs (SEN) are more likely to experience school exclusion. Common across each condition are challenges to executive function associated with emotional regulation (hot-executive function). This study explored the relationship between characteristics of Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorder, Oppositional Defiance Disorder, Autistic-Like Traits, and hot executive functions on the helpfulness of reward-based interventions for children with suspected or diagnosed FASD.

Between-group comparisons showed no significant difference in the reporting of Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorder characteristics, Oppositional Defiance Disorder characteristics, Autistic-Like Traits, and executive function, regardless of diagnostic state.

Long-term use of MA is associated with mental disorders, executive dysfunction, aggressive behaviors, and impulsivity among patients with MUD. However, identifying which factors may be more closely associated with relapse has not been investigated. Thus, we aimed to investigate the psychological factors and the history of MA use that may influence MA relapse. Methods This cross-sectional study included 168 male MUD patients (MUD group) and 65 healthy male residents (control group). Each patient was evaluated with self-report measures of executive dysfunction, psychopathological symptoms, impulsiveness, aggressiveness, and history of MA use. Data were analyzed with t-tests, analyses of variance, and correlation and regression analyses. Results The MUD group reported greater executive dysfunction, psychopathological symptoms, impulsivity, and aggression than the control group. Lower age of first MA use was associated both with having relapsed one or more times and with having relapsed two or more times; greater executive dysfunction was associated only with having relapsed two or more times. Conclusion Patients with MUD reported worse executive function and mental health. Current results also suggest that lower age of first MA use may influence relapse rate in general, while executive dysfunction may influence repeated relapse in particular. The present results add to the literature concerning factors that may increase the risk of relapse in individuals with MUD.\",\n      \"cited_by_count\": 2,\n      \"creators\": [\n        \"Linlin Mu\",\n        \"Yan Wang\",\n        \"Li-Jin Wang\",\n        \"Ling Xia\",\n        \"Wei Zhao\",\n        \"Pei-Pei Song\",\n        \"Jun-da Li\",\n        \"Wenjuan Wang\",\n        \"Lin Zhu\",\n        \"Hao Li\",\n        \"Yujing Wang\",\n        \"Hua-Jun Tang\",\n        \"Lei Zhang\",\n        \"Xun Song\",\n        \"Wenli Shao\",\n        \"Xiao-Chu Zhang\",\n        \"Huashan Xu\",\n        \"Dongliang Jiao\"\n      ],\n      \"doi\": \"10.3389/fpsyt.2022.971825\",\n      \"landing_page_url\": \"https://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.971825\",\n      \"pdf_url\": \"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.971825/pdf\",\n      \"publicationDate\": \"2022-10-13\",\n      \"title\": \"Associations of executive function and age of first use of methamphetamine with methamphetamine relapse\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"abstract\": \"Introduction Remission from major depressive disorder (MDD) is associated with residual symptoms related to reduced functioning, quality of life, and relapse risk. Previous studies have raised questions about mechanisms involved-in and affected by cognitive training. This study investigated the associations and changes among depressive symptoms, rumination, processing speed (PS), executive functioning (EF), and emotional working memory (e-WM) pre- post computerized working memory training (CWMT). Method Twenty-nine remitted participants were included in a pre- post pilot study of within-subject effects of online CWMT. A total of 20 participants completed the intervention and pre- post tests of EF and PS, e-WM, in addition to symptom and rumination measures. Associations between changes in symptoms and cognition were investigated pre- post. Associations between improvements in CWMT, depression history, and changes in cognition were explored. Hypotheses and statistics were preregistered before data were analyzed. Results Manipulation of negatively valanced stimuli in e-WM showed an inverse association with rumination pre-intervention, but the association disappeared post-intervention. Cognitive functioning improved in most conditions with largest effects in EF. Symptoms did not change in the remitted sample. CWMT improvements were related to improvements in some aspects of EF and PS, but also to worse self-reported attention. Depression history was related to less improvement in EF. Limitations Sample size was small and there was dropout from the study. There was no control group, thus precluding practice and placebo effects and causal relationships. Conclusions Computerized WM training improves cognitive functions and could influence associations between e-WM and rumination. This could counteract functional impairment following MDD.\",\n      \"cited_by_count\": 2,\n      \"creators\": [\n        \"E. Ronold\",\n        \"J. Joormann\",\n        \"\\u00c5.

                            "That sounds like a great plan! Let's start by creating a basic structure for your day, and then we can add in specific strategies for when you get stuck. Here's a sample routine:\n\n**Morning:**\n\n- **8:00 AM - 9:00 AM**: Wake up, perform morning hygiene routine, have a healthy breakfast.\n- **9:00 AM - 9:30 AM**: Mindfulness or meditation exercise to start the day with a clear mind.\n- **9:30 AM - 11:00 AM**: First study/learning session.\n\n**Midday:**\n\n- **11:00 AM - 11:30 AM**: Break. This could involve a short walk, a snack, or any other activity that helps you relax and reset.\n- **11:30 AM - 1:00 PM**: Second study/learning session.\n- **1:00 PM - 2:00 PM**: Lunch break. Try to eat a balanced meal to keep your energy levels up for the rest of the day.\n\n**Afternoon:**\n\n- **2:00 PM - 3:30 PM**: Third study/learning session.\n- **3:30 PM - 4:00 PM**: Break. Again, do something that helps you relax and reset.\n- **4:00 PM - 5:30 PM**: Fourth study/learning session.\n\n**Evening:**\n\n- **5:30 PM - 6:30 PM**: Physical activity. This could be a workout, a yoga session, or just a walk outside.\n- **6:30 PM - 7:30 PM**: Free time. Use this time to do something you enjoy, like reading, watching TV, or pursuing a hobby.\n- **7:30 PM - 8:30 PM**: Dinner.\n- **8:30 PM - 10:00 PM**: Relaxation time. This could involve reading, watching TV, or any other relaxing activity.\n- **10:00 PM**: Start preparing for bed. Try to maintain a consistent sleep schedule to ensure you're well-rested for the next day.\n\nWhen you get stuck during a study/learning session, here are some strategies you could use:\n\n1. **Take a short break**: Stand up, stretch, or take a short walk. This can help to reset your focus.\n\n2. **Change your environment**: If possible, try moving to a different location. A change of scenery can sometimes help to break through a mental block.\n\n3. **Practice mindfulness**: Take a few minutes to practice a mindfulness exercise. This can help to clear your mind and reduce feelings of overwhelm.\n\n4. **Break the task down**: If you're feeling overwhelmed by a task, try breaking it down into smaller, more manageable parts.\n\n5. **Visualize success**: Close your eyes and visualize yourself successfully completing the task. This can help to reduce anxiety and increase motivation.\n\nRemember, this is just a starting point. Feel free to adjust this schedule and these strategies to better suit your needs and preferences."

Here's a basic structure you could use:\n\n1. **Date**: This is where you'll record the date of each study session.\n\n2. **Task**: This is where you'll write a brief description of the task you worked on.\n\n3. **Start Time** and **End Time**: These columns are for recording when you started and finished each task.\n\n4. **Duration**: This is where you'll record how long you spent on each task. You can calculate this by subtracting the start time from the end time.\n\n5. **Breaks**: This is where you'll record any breaks you took during the task. You can note the duration of the break and what you did during the break (e.g., took a walk, meditated, etc.).\n\n6. **Notes**: This is a space for any additional notes you want to make about the task. You could record how you felt before and after the task, any challenges you encountered, or any strategies that were particularly helpful.\n\nHere's what this might look like in practice:\n\n| Date | Task | Start Time | End Time | Duration | Breaks | Notes |\n|------|------|------------|----------|----------|--------|-------|\n| 6/20 | Read chapter 1 | 9:30 AM | 11:00 AM | 1.5 hours | 10 min walk at 10:15 AM | Felt focused and engaged. Used visualization before starting. |\n\nYou can create this log in any spreadsheet program, like Google Sheets or Excel. At the end of each day, you can review your log to see what you accomplished and to identify any patterns or trends in your productivity. This can help you adjust your routine and strategies as needed."

                            "Absolutely, let's create specific action plans for each of these scenarios:\n\n**1. Feeling Overwhelmed and Can't Start Studying:**\n\n- **Step 1**: Take a moment to acknowledge your feelings. It's okay to feel overwhelmed.\n- **Step 2**: Practice a short mindfulness exercise. This could be a few minutes of deep breathing, a guided meditation, or simply sitting quietly and focusing on your senses.\n- **Step 3**: Break down your study tasks into smaller, more manageable parts. If you're not sure where to start, just choose one small task that seems doable.\n- **Step 4**: Visualize yourself successfully completing this small task. Try to imagine how you'll feel when it's done.\n- **Step 5**: Start with this small task. Don't worry about the rest of your study tasks for now. Just focus on this one thing.\n\n**2. Feeling Confused as to Where to Start Work or What to Accomplish When It All Looks the Same (i.e. Overcoming / Preventing Analysis Paralysis):**\n\n- **Step 1**: Take a moment to acknowledge your confusion. It's okay to not know where to start.\n- **Step 2**: Write down all of the tasks you need to complete. Don't worry about organizing them yet, just get them all down on paper.\n- **Step 3**: Look at your list and choose one task that seems important and doable. If you're not sure which task to choose, just pick one at random. The important thing is to make a decision and stick with it.\n- **Step 4**: Break this task down into smaller parts. Choose one part to start with.\n- **Step 5**: Focus on this one part of the task. Don't worry about the rest of the task or the other tasks on your list for now.\n\n**3. Feeling Distracted with Something Else Besides Work:**\n\n- **Step 1**: Acknowledge the distraction. Trying to ignore it might just make it more persistent.\n- **Step 2**: Decide if the distraction is something that needs to be addressed right now. If it's not urgent, write it down on a \"distractions\" list to deal with later.\n- **Step 3**: Practice a short mindfulness exercise to help refocus your attention on your work.\n- **Step 4**: Choose one small task to focus on. Try to fully engage with this task for a set amount of time (e.g., 20 minutes).\n- **Step 5**: After the set amount of time, take a short break. During this break, you can address one item from your \"distractions\" list if necessary.\n\n**4. Feeling Unmotivated to Start Work:**\n\n- **Step 1**: Acknowledge your lack of motivation. It's okay to not feel motivated all the time.\n- **Step 2**: Try to identify any underlying feelings that might be contributing to your lack of motivation. Are you tired? Stressed? Bored?\n- **Step 3**: Take a short break to address these underlying feelings. This could involve taking a short nap, doing a stress-relieving activity, or switching to a more interesting task.\n- **Step 4**: Visualize yourself successfully completing a task. Try to imagine how you'll feel when it's done.\n- **Step 5**: Choose one small task to start with. Don't worry about completing the whole task, just focus on getting started.\n\nRemember, these are just suggestions. Feel free to modify these steps to better suit your needs and preferences. The important thing is to have a plan in place for when these scenarios arise, so you're not left feeling stuck or overwhelmed."

According to research, \u301040\u2020five\u2020vitamu.com\u3011 factors that are responsible for radiology errors are:\n\n    * Heavy workload \n    * Visual fatigue \n    * Mental fatigue \n    * Inattentional blindness \n    * Lack of expertise \n\nAI algorithms can be trained to analyze medical images and identify patterns and abnormalities that may be missed by human eyes. This not only saves time, but it also helps to improve the accuracy of diagnoses and treatment plans.\n\nIn this article, we\u2019ll explore how AI can be used in medical imaging and top medical imaging companies.\n\n## How is AI used in medical imaging?\n\nAim of medical imaging is to capture abnormalities using image processing and machine learning techniques. Application areas can be divided into sub-branches such as the diagnosis of various diseases and medical operation planning. The top applications of AI-powered medical imaging are:\n\n### 1. Revealing cardiovascular abnormalities\n\nAccording to an\u301041\u2020 article\u2020www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\u3011 published by Frontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine Journal in 2019, the integration of AI into cardiac imaging will accelerate the process of the image analysis which is a repetitive task that can be automated, therefore healthcare professionals engaged in this work can focus on more important tasks.\n\n### 2. Prediction of Alzheimer\u2019s disease\n\nThe Radiologic Society of America\u301042\u2020 suggests\u2020www.rsna.org\u3011 that advances in AI can lead to predicting Alzheimer\u2019s disease years before it occurs by the identification of metabolic brain changes.\n\n### 3. Cancer detection\n\nIn early 2020, the Google health team \u301043\u2020announced\u2020www.wsj.com\u3011 that they developed an AI-based imaging system that outperformed medical professionals in detecting breast cancer.\n\n### 4. Treatment revaluation\n\nThis is mostly used for cancer patients undergoing treatment to check if the treatment is working effectively and diminishing the size of the tumor.\n\n### 5. Surgical Planning\n\nMedical imaging also allows for the segmentation of the image related to the surgical area so that the algorithm can do the planning for healthcare professionals automatically. Surgical planning with the help of medical imaging can saves time in surgeries.\n\nCheck our comprehensive article on the \u301044\u2020use of AI in radiology\u3011.\n\n## How mature are medical imaging applications?\n\nAI medical imaging applications give great results in research projects and pilots like this one for \u301045\u2020breast cancer\u2020www.nytimes.com\u3011 or \u301046\u2020pancreatic cancer\u2020www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\u3011. However, its use in the field is not common yet. This is because the FDA approval process can take years and the applications that were previously approved did not provide significant benefits. A computer-aided cancer detection software, approved by the FDA in 1998, was reported to cost more than $400M and did not show any significant improvement in a \u301047\u2020study\u2020www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\u3011.\n\nHowever, the future of AI-powered medical imaging is bright and new advancements happen continuously.

According to research, five factors that are responsible for radiology errors are:\n\n    * Heavy workload \n    * Visual fatigue \n    * Mental fatigue \n    * Inattentional blindness \n    * Lack of expertise \n\nAI algorithms can be trained to analyze medical images and identify patterns and abnormalities that may be missed by human eyes. This not only saves time, but it also helps to improve the accuracy of diagnoses and treatment plans.\n\nIn this article, we\u2019ll explore how AI can be used in medical imaging and top medical imaging companies.\n\n## How is AI used in medical imaging?\n\nAim of medical imaging is to capture abnormalities using image processing and machine learning techniques. Application areas can be divided into sub-branches such as the diagnosis of various diseases and medical operation planning. The top applications of AI-powered medical imaging are:\n\n### 1. Revealing cardiovascular abnormalities\n\nAccording to an article published by Frontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine Journal in 2019, the integration of AI into cardiac imaging will accelerate the process of the image analysis which is a repetitive task that can be automated, therefore healthcare professionals engaged in this work can focus on more important tasks.\n\n### 2. Prediction of Alzheimer\u2019s disease\n\nThe Radiologic Society of America suggests that advances in AI can lead to predicting Alzheimer\u2019s disease years before it occurs by the identification of metabolic brain changes.\n\n### 3. Cancer detection\n\nIn early 2020, the Google health team announced that they developed an AI-based imaging system that outperformed medical professionals in detecting breast cancer.\n\n### 4. Treatment revaluation\n\nThis is mostly used for cancer patients undergoing treatment to check if the treatment is working effectively and diminishing the size of the tumor.\n\n### 5. Surgical Planning\n\nMedical imaging also allows for the segmentation of the image related to the surgical area so that the algorithm can do the planning for healthcare professionals automatically. Surgical planning with the help of medical imaging can saves time in surgeries.\n\nCheck our comprehensive article on the use of AI in radiology.\n\n## How mature are medical imaging applications?\n\nAI medical imaging applications give great results in research projects and pilots like this one for breast cancer or pancreatic cancer. However, its use in the field is not common yet. This is because the FDA approval process can take years and the applications that were previously approved did not provide significant benefits. A computer-aided cancer detection software, approved by the FDA in 1998, was reported to cost more than $400M and did not show any significant improvement in a study.\n\nHowever, the future of AI-powered medical imaging is bright and new advancements happen continuously. For instance, in November 2020, the Technical University of Munich has developed a machine learning model for detecting diabetes induced eye diseases as accurately as humans. \n\n## How can AI-powered medical imaging technologies be used during the COVID-19 outbreak?\n\nMedical imaging is one of the AI-powered solutions that is on an uptrend with the COVID-19 pandemic.

This not only saves time, but it also helps to improve the accuracy of diagnoses and treatment plans.\n\nIn this article, we\u2019ll explore how AI can be used in medical imaging and top medical imaging companies.\n\n## How is AI used in medical imaging?\n\nAim of medical imaging is to capture abnormalities using image processing and machine learning techniques. Application areas can be divided into sub-branches such as the diagnosis of various diseases and medical operation planning. The top applications of AI-powered medical imaging are:\n\n### 1. Revealing cardiovascular abnormalities\n\nAccording to an article published by Frontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine Journal in 2019, the integration of AI into cardiac imaging will accelerate the process of the image analysis which is a repetitive task that can be automated, therefore healthcare professionals engaged in this work can focus on more important tasks.\n\n### 2. Prediction of Alzheimer\u2019s disease\n\nThe Radiologic Society of America suggests that advances in AI can lead to predicting Alzheimer\u2019s disease years before it occurs by the identification of metabolic brain changes.\n\n### 3. Cancer detection\n\nIn early 2020, the Google health team announced that they developed an AI-based imaging system that outperformed medical professionals in detecting breast cancer.\n\n### 4. Treatment revaluation\n\nThis is mostly used for cancer patients undergoing treatment to check if the treatment is working effectively and diminishing the size of the tumor.\n\n### 5. Surgical Planning\n\nMedical imaging also allows for the segmentation of the image related to the surgical area so that the algorithm can do the planning for healthcare professionals automatically. Surgical planning with the help of medical imaging can saves time in surgeries.\n\nCheck our comprehensive article on the use of AI in radiology.\n\n## How mature are medical imaging applications?\n\nAI medical imaging applications give great results in research projects and pilots like this one for breast cancer or pancreatic cancer. However, its use in the field is not common yet. This is because the FDA approval process can take years and the applications that were previously approved did not provide significant benefits. A computer-aided cancer detection software, approved by the FDA in 1998, was reported to cost more than $400M and did not show any significant improvement in a study.\n\nHowever, the future of AI-powered medical imaging is bright and new advancements happen continuously. For instance, in November 2020, the Technical University of Munich has developed a machine learning model for detecting diabetes induced eye diseases as accurately as humans. \n\n## How can AI-powered medical imaging technologies be used during the COVID-19 outbreak?\n\nMedical imaging is one of the AI-powered solutions that is on an uptrend with the COVID-19 pandemic. Due to the rapid increase in the number of patients, the analysis and interpretation of patients\u2019 chest scan results became a problem. A Chinese company, Huiying Medical has developed an AI-powered imaging diagnostic solution to detect the virus in the early stage with 96% accuracy. \n\n[Image: huiying medical]Source: Intel\n\nPneumonia is a serious complication of COVID-19 and results in patients requiring ventilator support. In collaborative research by the University of California San Diego health department and AWS, a model was built to analyze chest images of patients at risk of pneumonia. The model was trained to identify patients infected with Covid-19 by using AI-powered medical imaging. The algorithm was trained on 22,000 notations by human radiologists. The algorithm performs color-coded maps that indicate the probability of pneumonia.\n\n## Leading medical imaging companies\n\nWe prepared a sortable list of all AI-powered medical imaging companies and their product with an indication of whether they have a free trial/community edition.\n\n    * IBM Watson is one of the pioneers in healthcare applications powered by Artificial Intelligence.

While these systems showed promise, they were limited in adapting and generalizing to new data.\n\nThe emergence of machine learning (ML) and artificial neural networks (ANNs) in the 1980s and 1990s provided a more flexible and adaptive approach to medical image analysis. However, the limited computing power and lack of large datasets held back the true potential of these techniques.\n\n### Key milestones and breakthroughs in AI-driven imaging\n\nThe game-changer for AI in medical imaging came with the development of deep learning algorithms and the proliferation of graphics processing units (GPUs) in the early 2010s.\n\nThis enabled large-scale convolutional neural networks (CNNs) training on massive datasets, leading to unprecedented image recognition and analysis advancements. Some key milestones and breakthroughs in AI-driven medical imaging include:\n\n#### AlexNet (2012)\n\nA deep CNN that significantly outperformed traditional methods in the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge, sparking increased interest in deep learning for image analysis.\n\n#### U-Net (2015)\n\nA CNN architecture designed explicitly for biomedical image segmentation allows for precisely identifying regions of interest within medical images.\n\n#### The rise of transfer learning (mid-2010s)\n\nUsing pre-trained CNNs as feature extractors for medical imaging tasks facilitated the rapid development and deployment of AI models, even with limited datasets.\n\n#### Generative adversarial networks (GANs) (2014)\n\nGANs opened new avenues for synthetic medical image generation, data augmentation, and image-to-image translation tasks, further enhancing the capabilities of AI-driven medical imaging.\n\n#### FDA approvals of AI-driven medical imaging solutions (late 2010s)\n\nRegulatory bodies' approval of several AI-powered medical imaging solutions marked a turning point, paving the way for increased adoption in clinical settings.\n\nThese breakthroughs have set the stage for AI-driven medical imaging to significantly impact healthcare diagnostics, potentially revolutionizing how medical professionals diagnose and treat various diseases and conditions.\n\n## Future of AI-driven Medical Imaging\n\nThe future of AI-driven medical imaging holds immense promise, with emerging technologies and research poised to revolutionize healthcare diagnostics further.\n\nBy embracing these advancements and addressing challenges and limitations, the medical community can unlock the full potential of AI-driven medical imaging to improve patient care and outcomes.\n\n### Emerging technologies and research\n\nAs AI continues to evolve, new techniques and technologies are being developed that have the potential to enhance AI-driven medical imaging further. Some emerging areas of research include:\n\n  * Explainable AI (XAI): Developing AI models that can provide clear and understandable explanations for their decisions, improving trust and acceptance among medical professionals.\n\n  * Federated learning: A distributed approach to training AI models, which allows for the use of data from multiple institutions without compromising privacy or security.\n\n  * Multimodal AI: Integrating information from different imaging modalities (e.g., MRI, CT, PET) and other data sources (e.g., genomics, electronic health records) to improve diagnostic performance and provide a more comprehensive understanding of a patient's condition.\n\n### Potential collaboration with other advanced technologies\n\nIntegrating AI-driven medical imaging with other advanced technologies can lead to new and innovative applications in healthcare diagnostics. Some possible synergies include:\n\n  * Augmented reality (AR): Combining AI-driven medical imaging with AR can provide real-time, context-aware visualizations during surgical procedures or interventions, improving precision and reducing the risk of complications.\n\n  * 3D printing: AI algorithms can generate patient-specific 3D models based on medical imaging data, which can be printed in surgical planning, patient education, or creating personalized medical devices.\n\n  * Robotics and automation: AI-driven medical imaging can play a crucial role in developing intelligent surgical robots, automated biopsy systems, and other devices that can assist healthcare professionals in performing complex tasks with increased accuracy and efficiency.\n\n### The evolving role of radiologists and other healthcare professionals\n\nThe increasing adoption of AI-driven medical imaging will likely change the position of radiologists and other healthcare professionals involved in diagnostic imaging.\n\nRather than being replaced by AI, these professionals will need to adapt and collaborate with these new technologies, focusing on tasks that require human expertise, such as complex case analysis, treatment planning, and patient care.\n\nAdditionally, they must develop new skills in data science, AI ethics, and algorithm validation to ensure the responsible and effective use of AI-driven medical imaging in clinical practice.\n\n## Key Techniques and Technologies in AI-driven Medical Imaging\n\nThese key techniques and technologies have accelerated the development and application of AI-driven medical imaging, potentially enhancing diagnostic accuracy, efficiency, and patient care significantly.\n\n### Machine learning and deep learning algorithms\n\nMachine learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence that teaches computers to learn from data, identify patterns, and make predictions or decisions. ML algorithms have been used in medical imaging for image classification, segmentation, and registration tasks.\n\nDeep learning, a subfield of ML, focuses on artificial neural networks (ANNs) with multiple layers that can automatically learn complex, hierarchical representations of input data.\n\n### Convolutional neural networks (CNNs)\n\nCNNs are a type of deep learning architecture specifically designed for image analysis. They consist of multiple layers, including convolutional, pooling, and fully connected layers, which work together to learn and extract features from images.\n\nCNNs have achieved state-of-the-art performance in various medical imaging tasks, such as detecting tumors, identifying lung nodules, and diagnosing retinal diseases.\n\n### Generative adversarial networks (GANs)\n\nGANs are a class of deep learning models that consist of two neural networks, a generator and a discriminator, which compete against each other in a game-theoretic framework. The generator learns to create synthetic images, while the discriminator learns to distinguish between authentic and generated images.\n\nGANs have been used in medical imaging for data augmentation, image synthesis, and image-to-image translation, improving the quality and versatility of available datasets.\n\n### Transfer learning and reinforcement learning\n\nTransfer learning is a technique that leverages pre-trained models, often trained on large-scale general-purpose datasets,\nVisible: 0% - 64%",

It has an anonymizing library that removes patient-related tags from the DICOM image\u301017\u2020source\u3011.\n\n2. **FViewer DICOM Online Viewer**: Provides several viewing options, multiple format support, and features that might not be found in other viewers like a tabbed browser per image\u301018\u2020source\u3011.\n\n3. **PostDICOM**: Provides 50GB free space for uploading, organizing, and sharing DICOM files. It supports multiple modalities/DICOM file extensions with advanced display features and viewing options\u301019\u2020source\u3011.\n\n4. **OHIF Viewer**: An open-source web viewer with advanced viewing options, layout, DICOM tags browser, and more. It can be installed by institutions or hospitals for their custom needs\u301020\u2020source\u3011.\n\n5. **Med3Web**: An open-source web-based DICOM viewer that supports advanced 3D visualization including surface and volume rendering\u301021\u2020source\u3011.\n\n6. **DICOMGo**: Comes with a set of advanced features packed in its simple, easy-to-use interface. It can be used without registration\u301022\u2020source\u3011.\n\nOther options that were mentioned but with less detail include Papaya Viewer, Weasis DICOM Viewer, DICOM-web, DICOM Viewer by Rubo Medical Imaging, and Box DICOM Viewer\u301022\u2020source\u3011.\n\nIn terms of AI diagnostics, I couldn't find explicit information for these specific DICOM viewers. However, AI is being utilized in the field of medical imaging, with notable companies like IBM Watson, Butterfly Network, Arterys, Gauss Surgical Inc., and Zebra Medical Vision developing solutions that leverage AI to improve diagnostics and patient outcomes\u30109\u2020source\u3011. \n\nThe integration of AI diagnostics with DICOM viewers is a complex process that may not be present in all viewers, especially free ones. It would likely require a specialized viewer developed by a company actively working in the AI healthcare space. If you are specifically interested in AI-powered diagnostics, you may need to look for specialized software that integrates AI capabilities and DICOM viewing."

                            "It sounds like you're interested in exploring AI-powered medical imaging tools that can analyze DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine) files. These tools use machine learning algorithms to identify patterns in medical images that may be indicative of specific conditions or diseases.\n\nAs of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021, there were several AI-powered medical imaging tools available, but most of them were designed for use by healthcare professionals and required a license or subscription. Additionally, these tools were typically integrated into a hospital's existing imaging systems and were not generally available for individual testing or experimentation.\n\nHowever, there are some open-source projects and platforms that you might be able to use for testing purposes. Here are a few examples:\n\n1. **MONAI**: The Medical Open Network for AI (MONAI) is an open-source project that provides tools and frameworks for healthcare research. It includes support for DICOM files and has several pre-trained models that you can use.\n\n2. **NiftyNet**: NiftyNet is another open-source project that provides tools for medical imaging. It includes support for a wide range of medical imaging modalities, including DICOM.\n\n3. **Google's Cloud Healthcare API**: This API includes methods for storing, accessing, and analyzing medical data, including DICOM files. It also includes pre-trained models for certain types of analysis.\n\n4. **NVIDIA Clara**: NVIDIA's Clara platform includes tools for medical imaging and genomics. It includes support for DICOM files and has several pre-trained models that you can use.\n\nPlease note that while these tools can provide valuable insights, they are not intended to replace professional medical advice. Any findings should be confirmed by a healthcare professional.\n\nAlso, it's important to remember that AI models are only as good as the data they're trained on. If the models you're testing haven't been trained on data that's similar to your DICOM sets, they may not perform well.\n\nFinally, when working with medical data, it's crucial to ensure that all data is anonymized and handled in accordance with relevant privacy laws and regulations."

Given this, I am not able to provide a detailed comparison of ToneX and Amplitube 5 at this time. However, I can tell you that both ToneX and Amplitube 5 are products by IK Multimedia and are designed to provide high-quality sound modeling for musicians, with ToneX offering a hardware pedal and Amplitube 5 being a software-based solution.\n\nI recommend accessing IK Multimedia's official website or other reliable music technology review sites for a comprehensive list of Amplitube 5's features. I apologize for any inconvenience and am here to assist further if needed."

While the class material may not be necessary, there are some resources that you should probably take a look at before jumping into the project, because the way I did it turned out to be a bit of a mistake. I started working my way through, one step at a time, and the final portion of the project is actually not about data cleaning about about performing a principal component analysis in Python or R, whichever you choose to code in. This, I was less familiar with, and as I found resources to guide me through this, I found that the \"guide\" for the class project was quite a bit more specific than the \"official\" project rubric, which I found to be overly vague and had interpreted in some ways that conflicted with the \"guide\" to what they were apparently looking for. \n\nSo, for anyone else taking this class, I would strongly suggest starting with \u301078\u2020taking a look at what I referred to as the \"secret\" rubric\u2020westerngovernorsuniversity-my.sharepoint.com\u3011. If you read through the \"official\" project rubric in the performance assessment page, you'll probably have some questions because it is not very detailed or specific about what is expected from you or what limitations exist on your cleaning of the dataset you choose. The guide will address all of this in much more detail. There are also a series of four lectures by Dr Middleton, the first three of which address the data cleaning element of the course, all of which I skipped. \u301079\u20201\u2020wgu.hosted.panopto.com\u3011 \u301080\u20202\u2020wgu.hosted.panopto.com\u3011 \u301081\u20203\u2020wgu.hosted.panopto.com\u3011\n\nFor the cleaning itself, previous courses that I've done specified certain things that needed fixed, but this class did not. As best I could tell in the hospital dataset, there were no outliers to drop (though you should verify and demonstrate this), and you should address missing values in whatever way that you feel appropriate, as long as you justify your process. I think I took a bit of an unusual approach to this, but I still got credit and passed the performance assessment. Besides that, the main thing that needed done was fixing columns that had incorrect datatypes, and fixing the data to match the correct datatype. \n\nThe cleaning itself ended up being really easy - the hardest part was breaking everything down in the overly detailed way that the PA required. For example, rather than just seeing \"oh, zip codes are stored as integers, that needs fixed\" and doing so, you have to provide code to identify the issue, then write up how you're going to fix it, then provide code to fix the issue, then verify the issue is fixed. While that is all something that normally gets done in an iterative process, having it all distinctly broken up into different sections of the report feels awkward, because you're spending so much more time talking about fixing the issue rather than just doing it. \n\nThe real challenge of this PA comes at the very end, with the Principal Component Analysis. While this isn't actually about Data Cleaning, this is apparently a concept that they wanted to build in so that students could gain some familiarity with it. I hadn't done anything with PCA before, so this was new to me. This concept (and the associated code) is covered to at least some degree in the course materials in Lesson 7, so that might be worth taking a look at. I enjoyed \u301082\u2020Dr Middleton's fourth and final class lecture\u2020wgu.hosted.panopto.com\u3011, which really did a great job of breaking down both the concept and the code inside of an hour (the last 20-30 minutes is Q & A that I skipped). \u301083\u2020This article by Matt Brems on Towards Data Science\u2020towardsdatascience.com\u3011 was also useful for breaking down the concept in a really informative way. This ended up being fairly simple to do in the long run (the code provided in Dr. Middleton's lectures is pretty simple), but it was definitely the main thing that slowed me down here. \n\nAs for the submission of your PA, the \"guide\" that I linked above definitely speaks to APA format and implies a separate formal report from your code. Personally, I wrote the entire thing up in a Jupyter Notebook, allowing me to weave markdown cells and code cells to tell the narrative of my project while also demonstrating my working code. For my video, I opened up the notebook, hit restart kernel and run all, and then talked through the entire report, demonstrating that all of the code had reset and executed without issue. I had wondered if my PA might not be rejected because I specifically did not use APA formatting, but it passed without issue. I did save the .ipynb as a PDF and then submitted both (along with the cleaned dataset in CSV\nVisible: 14% - 78%",

While the class material may not be necessary, there are some resources that you should probably take a look at before jumping into the project, because the way I did it turned out to be a bit of a mistake. I started working my way through, one step at a time, and the final portion of the project is actually not about data cleaning about about performing a principal component analysis in Python or R, whichever you choose to code in. This, I was less familiar with, and as I found resources to guide me through this, I found that the \"guide\" for the class project was quite a bit more specific than the \"official\" project rubric, which I found to be overly vague and had interpreted in some ways that conflicted with the \"guide\" to what they were apparently looking for. \n\nSo, for anyone else taking this class, I would strongly suggest starting with taking a look at what I referred to as the \"secret\" rubric. If you read through the \"official\" project rubric in the performance assessment page, you'll probably have some questions because it is not very detailed or specific about what is expected from you or what limitations exist on your cleaning of the dataset you choose. The guide will address all of this in much more detail. There are also a series of four lectures by Dr Middleton, the first three of which address the data cleaning element of the course, all of which I skipped. 1 2 3\n\nFor the cleaning itself, previous courses that I've done specified certain things that needed fixed, but this class did not. As best I could tell in the hospital dataset, there were no outliers to drop (though you should verify and demonstrate this), and you should address missing values in whatever way that you feel appropriate, as long as you justify your process. I think I took a bit of an unusual approach to this, but I still got credit and passed the performance assessment. Besides that, the main thing that needed done was fixing columns that had incorrect datatypes, and fixing the data to match the correct datatype. \n\nThe cleaning itself ended up being really easy - the hardest part was breaking everything down in the overly detailed way that the PA required. For example, rather than just seeing \"oh, zip codes are stored as integers, that needs fixed\" and doing so, you have to provide code to identify the issue, then write up how you're going to fix it, then provide code to fix the issue, then verify the issue is fixed. While that is all something that normally gets done in an iterative process, having it all distinctly broken up into different sections of the report feels awkward, because you're spending so much more time talking about fixing the issue rather than just doing it. \n\nThe real challenge of this PA comes at the very end, with the Principal Component Analysis. While this isn't actually about Data Cleaning, this is apparently a concept that they wanted to build in so that students could gain some familiarity with it. I hadn't done anything with PCA before, so this was new to me. This concept (and the associated code) is covered to at least some degree in the course materials in Lesson 7, so that might be worth taking a look at. I enjoyed Dr Middleton's fourth and final class lecture, which really did a great job of breaking down both the concept and the code inside of an hour (the last 20-30 minutes is Q & A that I skipped). This article by Matt Brems on Towards Data Science was also useful for breaking down the concept in a really informative way. This ended up being fairly simple to do in the long run (the code provided in Dr. Middleton's lectures is pretty simple), but it was definitely the main thing that slowed me down here. \n\nAs for the submission of your PA, the \"guide\" that I linked above definitely speaks to APA format and implies a separate formal report from your code. Personally, I wrote the entire thing up in a Jupyter Notebook, allowing me to weave markdown cells and code cells to tell the narrative of my project while also demonstrating my working code. For my video, I opened up the notebook, hit restart kernel and run all, and then talked through the entire report, demonstrating that all of the code had reset and executed without issue. I had wondered if my PA might not be rejected because I specifically did not use APA formatting, but it passed without issue. I did save the .ipynb as a PDF and then submitted both (along with the cleaned dataset in CSV\nVisible: 14% - 78%",

While the class material may not be necessary, there are some resources that you should probably take a look at before jumping into the project, because the way I did it turned out to be a bit of a mistake. I started working my way through, one step at a time, and the final portion of the project is actually not about data cleaning about about performing a principal component analysis in Python or R, whichever you choose to code in. This, I was less familiar with, and as I found resources to guide me through this, I found that the \"guide\" for the class project was quite a bit more specific than the \"official\" project rubric, which I found to be overly vague and had interpreted in some ways that conflicted with the \"guide\" to what they were apparently looking for. \n\nSo, for anyone else taking this class, I would strongly suggest starting with taking a look at what I referred to as the \"secret\" rubric. If you read through the \"official\" project rubric in the performance assessment page, you'll probably have some questions because it is not very detailed or specific about what is expected from you or what limitations exist on your cleaning of the dataset you choose. The guide will address all of this in much more detail. There are also a series of four lectures by Dr Middleton, the first three of which address the data cleaning element of the course, all of which I skipped. 1 2 3\n\nFor the cleaning itself, previous courses that I've done specified certain things that needed fixed, but this class did not. As best I could tell in the hospital dataset, there were no outliers to drop (though you should verify and demonstrate this), and you should address missing values in whatever way that you feel appropriate, as long as you justify your process. I think I took a bit of an unusual approach to this, but I still got credit and passed the performance assessment. Besides that, the main thing that needed done was fixing columns that had incorrect datatypes, and fixing the data to match the correct datatype. \n\nThe cleaning itself ended up being really easy - the hardest part was breaking everything down in the overly detailed way that the PA required. For example, rather than just seeing \"oh, zip codes are stored as integers, that needs fixed\" and doing so, you have to provide code to identify the issue, then write up how you're going to fix it, then provide code to fix the issue, then verify the issue is fixed. While that is all something that normally gets done in an iterative process, having it all distinctly broken up into different sections of the report feels awkward, because you're spending so much more time talking about fixing the issue rather than just doing it. \n\nThe real challenge of this PA comes at the very end, with the Principal Component Analysis. While this isn't actually about Data Cleaning, this is apparently a concept that they wanted to build in so that students could gain some familiarity with it. I hadn't done anything with PCA before, so this was new to me. This concept (and the associated code) is covered to at least some degree in the course materials in Lesson 7, so that might be worth taking a look at. I enjoyed Dr Middleton's fourth and final class lecture, which really did a great job of breaking down both the concept and the code inside of an hour (the last 20-30 minutes is Q & A that I skipped). This article by Matt Brems on Towards Data Science was also useful for breaking down the concept in a really informative way. This ended up being fairly simple to do in the long run (the code provided in Dr. Middleton's lectures is pretty simple), but it was definitely the main thing that slowed me down here. \n\nAs for the submission of your PA, the \"guide\" that I linked above definitely speaks to APA format and implies a separate formal report from your code. Personally, I wrote the entire thing up in a Jupyter Notebook, allowing me to weave markdown cells and code cells to tell the narrative of my project while also demonstrating my working code. For my video, I opened up the notebook, hit restart kernel and run all, and then talked through the entire report, demonstrating that all of the code had reset and executed without issue. I had wondered if my PA might not be rejected because I specifically did not use APA formatting, but it passed without issue. I did save the .ipynb as a PDF and then submitted both (along with the cleaned dataset in CSV\nVisible: 14% - 78%",

While the class material may not be necessary, there are some resources that you should probably take a look at before jumping into the project, because the way I did it turned out to be a bit of a mistake. I started working my way through, one step at a time, and the final portion of the project is actually not about data cleaning about about performing a principal component analysis in Python or R, whichever you choose to code in. This, I was less familiar with, and as I found resources to guide me through this, I found that the \"guide\" for the class project was quite a bit more specific than the \"official\" project rubric, which I found to be overly vague and had interpreted in some ways that conflicted with the \"guide\" to what they were apparently looking for. \n\nSo, for anyone else taking this class, I would strongly suggest starting with taking a look at what I referred to as the \"secret\" rubric. If you read through the \"official\" project rubric in the performance assessment page, you'll probably have some questions because it is not very detailed or specific about what is expected from you or what limitations exist on your cleaning of the dataset you choose. The guide will address all of this in much more detail. There are also a series of four lectures by Dr Middleton, the first three of which address the data cleaning element of the course, all of which I skipped. 1 2 3\n\nFor the cleaning itself, previous courses that I've done specified certain things that needed fixed, but this class did not. As best I could tell in the hospital dataset, there were no outliers to drop (though you should verify and demonstrate this), and you should address missing values in whatever way that you feel appropriate, as long as you justify your process. I think I took a bit of an unusual approach to this, but I still got credit and passed the performance assessment. Besides that, the main thing that needed done was fixing columns that had incorrect datatypes, and fixing the data to match the correct datatype. \n\nThe cleaning itself ended up being really easy - the hardest part was breaking everything down in the overly detailed way that the PA required. For example, rather than just seeing \"oh, zip codes are stored as integers, that needs fixed\" and doing so, you have to provide code to identify the issue, then write up how you're going to fix it, then provide code to fix the issue, then verify the issue is fixed. While that is all something that normally gets done in an iterative process, having it all distinctly broken up into different sections of the report feels awkward, because you're spending so much more time talking about fixing the issue rather than just doing it. \n\nThe real challenge of this PA comes at the very end, with the Principal Component Analysis. While this isn't actually about Data Cleaning, this is apparently a concept that they wanted to build in so that students could gain some familiarity with it. I hadn't done anything with PCA before, so this was new to me.

Personally, I wrote the entire thing up in a Jupyter Notebook, allowing me to weave markdown cells and code cells to tell the narrative of my project while also demonstrating my working code. For my video, I opened up the notebook, hit restart kernel and run all, and then talked through the entire report, demonstrating that all of the code had reset and executed without issue. I had wondered if my PA might not be rejected because I specifically did not use APA formatting, but it passed without issue.

                            "I found several discussions about the D206 - Data Cleaning course's Performance Assessment (PA) from Western Governors University (WGU) on Reddit. Here are the main insights:\n\n1. **Principal Component Analysis (PCA):** This was mentioned as the first \"hard\" topic, and the math can be heavy. There's a recommendation to follow the book and let the libraries do the work. The topic was emphasized in several posts, with one person noting that the final part of the PA is not about data cleaning but about performing a PCA. They also recommended Dr. Middleton's fourth and final class lecture for understanding this concept, as well as an article by Matt Brems on Towards Data Science\u30107\u2020source\u3011\u30109\u2020source\u3011\u301020\u2020source\u3011\u301024\u2020source\u3011.\n\n2. **Data Cleaning:**\n   - For identifying anomalies, one user recommended using the box and whiskers plot graph, which is easy to identify and point out. It was suggested to use Python and Pycharm for this, which are popular and easy to troubleshoot\u30108\u2020source\u3011.\n   - Another person said that the cleaning was straightforward but that it was time-consuming to break everything down in the detailed manner required by the PA. For instance, one has to provide code to identify an issue, write up how they'll fix it, provide code to fix the issue, then verify that the issue is fixed\u301023\u2020source\u3011.\n   - It was noted that the class does not specify certain things that need fixing. In the hospital dataset, for example, there were no outliers to drop (though this should be verified), and you should address missing values in a way that you feel is appropriate as long as you justify your process\u301022\u2020source\u3011.\n\n3. **Research Question:** Some users had their research question rejected because it did not involve all variables or it was a correlation question. It appears that the research question needs to be in line with the data set used and the variables chosen for analysis\u301011\u2020source\u3011\u301012\u2020source\u3011\u301013\u2020source\u3011\u301014\u2020source\u3011.\n\n4. **Course Guide and Rubric:** There was a suggestion to start with what one user referred to as the \"secret\" rubric. The official project rubric in the performance assessment page was described as not very detailed or specific, while the guide addresses all of this in much more detail. There are also a series of four lectures by Dr. Middleton, the first three of which address the data cleaning element of the course\u301021\u2020source\u3011.\n\n5. **Submission Format:** One user wrote their entire project in a Jupyter Notebook, weaving markdown cells and code cells to tell the project's narrative while also demonstrating the working code. Despite the guide implying a separate formal report from the code, this user's submission in the Jupyter Notebook format passed without issue\u301025\u2020source\u3011.\n\nPlease note that these are individual experiences and interpretations, and actual course requirements or expectations may vary. Always refer to the official course materials and instructions provided by WGU for the most accurate information. If you want more specific information or additional insights, let me know, and I'll be happy to assist further!"

While the class material may not be necessary, there are some resources that you should probably take a look at before jumping into the project, because the way I did it turned out to be a bit of a mistake. I started working my way through, one step at a time, and the final portion of the project is actually not about data cleaning about about performing a principal component analysis in Python or R, whichever you choose to code in. This, I was less familiar with, and as I found resources to guide me through this, I found that the \"guide\" for the class project was quite a bit more specific than the \"official\" project rubric, which I found to be overly vague and had interpreted in some ways that conflicted with the \"guide\" to what they were apparently looking for",

While this isn't actually about Data Cleaning, this is apparently a concept that they wanted to build in so that students could gain some familiarity with it. I hadn't done anything with PCA before, so this was new to me. This concept (and the associated code) is covered to at least some degree in the course materials in Lesson 7, so that might be worth taking a look at. I enjoyed Dr Middleton's fourth and final class lecture, which really did a great job of breaking down both the concept and the code inside of an hour (the last 20-30 minutes is Q & A that I skipped). This article by Matt Brems on Towards Data Science was also useful for breaking down the concept in a really informative way. This ended up being fairly simple to do in the long run (the code provided in Dr. Middleton's lectures is pretty simple), but it was definitely the main thing that slowed me down here",

If you read through the \"official\" project rubric in the performance assessment page, you'll probably have some questions because it is not very detailed or specific about what is expected from you or what limitations exist on your cleaning of the dataset you choose. The guide will address all of this in much more detail. There are also a series of four lectures by Dr Middleton, the first three of which address the data cleaning element of the course, all of which I skipped",

Personally, I wrote the entire thing up in a Jupyter Notebook, allowing me to weave markdown cells and code cells to tell the narrative of my project while also demonstrating my working code. For my video, I opened up the notebook, hit restart kernel and run all, and then talked through the entire report, demonstrating that all of the code had reset and executed without issue. I had wondered if my PA might not be rejected because I specifically did not use APA formatting, but it passed without issue",

                            "If you're experiencing inconsistent paragraph indentation in Microsoft Word, it could be due to formatting or settings within your document. Here are a few possible reasons and solutions:\n\n1. Different styles: Check if the lines with inconsistent indentation have different paragraph styles applied. In Word, styles determine the formatting for different elements of the document. Make sure all paragraphs have the same style applied to maintain consistent indentation.\n\n2. Manual formatting: If you have manually adjusted the indentation for certain lines, they may not align properly. Select the entire paragraph and reset the indentation to the desired setting using the ruler or the paragraph settings.\n\n3. Hanging indent: Word offers a feature called \"hanging indent\" that is commonly used in reference lists or bibliographies. It indents the second and subsequent lines of a paragraph while keeping the first line flush with the left margin. Make sure you're not using hanging indent inadvertently.\n\n4. Formatting conflicts: It's possible that conflicting formatting is causing the issue. Check if there are any tables, text boxes, or other elements within or around the affected paragraphs that could be interfering with the indentation. Remove or adjust those elements as necessary.\n\n5. Section breaks: If you have section breaks in your document, they can affect the indentation settings for different sections. Ensure that the indentation settings are consistent throughout the entire document.\n\nBy addressing these potential issues, you should be able to resolve any inconsistencies in paragraph indentation in Microsoft Word."

                            "Sure, I can help with that. APA (American Psychological Association) style is often used to cite sources in the social sciences. Here's the general format for APA citations.\n\n1. Book: \nAuthor's Last name, First Initial. Middle Initial. (Year of Publication). Title of work: Subtitle. Publisher.\n\nExample: \nSmith, J. K. (2020). The journey to AI: Understanding the future. Fantastic Press.\n\n2. Journal Article: \nAuthor's Last name, First Initial. Middle Initial. (Year of Publication). Title of article. Title of Journal, Volume number(Issue number), page range.\n\nExample: \nSmith, J. K., & Jones, R. L. (2020). The effects of artificial intelligence on society. Journal of Tech Studies, 45(2), 123-145.\n\n3. Website: \nAuthor's Last name, First Initial. Middle Initial. (Year, Month Date of Publication). Title of webpage/article. Site Name. URL\n\nExample: \nSmith, J. K. (2020, August 20). Understanding artificial intelligence. Tech Insights. https://www.techinsights.com/understanding-ai.html\n\nPlease note that if a source doesn't have an author, you can start the citation with the title of the work. If there's no date, you can use (n.d.) which stands for no date. Also, in the latest version of APA (7th edition), it is no longer required to include the place of publication for books. \n\nFinally, all entries should be double-spaced, and the first line should be flush with the left margin. Subsequent lines should be indented half an inch (this is called a hanging indent). For electronic sources such as websites, include the URL at the end of the reference. Also, it's important to note that the titles of books and journals should be in italics.\n\nThis is just a general guide, and there might be additional rules or exceptions based on the type of source you're citing. It's always a good idea to consult the official APA Style Guide or a trusted online resource to ensure you're following the most current guidelines."

In APA style, in-text citations usually follow direct quotes or paraphrased information to indicate the source. If all your data is from one source, you could state this explicitly in your paper.\n\nFor example:\n\n\"All data used in this study were retrieved from the Western Governors University's virtual machine (https://lrps.wgu.edu/provision/271283956, n.d.).\"\n\nThen, in your reference list, you would include the full citation:\n\nhttps://lrps.wgu.edu/provision/271283956.

Retrieved June 15, 2023, from https://lrps.wgu.edu/provision/271283956\n\nRemember, the in-text citation should correspond to the entry in your reference list, helping the reader identify and match the sources. If the source is unique, like a specific VM or software, it's always a good idea to provide as much detail as possible to help your reader understand the nature of the source."

In APA format, it's typical to include this kind of information to indicate the medium or format of the source.\n\nFor instance, you might see \"[Film]\" or \"[Television series]\" in an APA citation for a movie or TV show, or \"[Ebook]\" for an electronic book. This helps the reader understand what type of source you're referring to, which can be particularly helpful when the citation doesn't clearly convey this (for example, when citing a URL that might not clearly indicate the nature of the content).\n\nSo, \"[Software]\" in your citation is indicating that the source you're referencing is software\u2014in this case, a virtual machine you accessed via a URL. This informs the reader that the source you're citing isn't a typical website, article, or book, but a piece of software."
