                            "It looks like you've provided a Dockerfile snippet that sets up a container using the Node.js 20 image based on the Alpine Linux distribution. Here's a breakdown of what each line is doing:\n\n1. **`FROM node:20-alpine`**: This line specifies that the base image for the Docker container will be Node.js version 20, based on the lightweight Alpine Linux distribution.\n2. **`RUN apk add --no-cache python3 g++ make`**: This command installs Python 3, the GNU C++ compiler, and GNU Make using the Alpine package manager (apk). The `--no-cache` option means that the package manager cache will not be retained, reducing the image size.\n3. **`WORKDIR /app`**: This sets the working directory inside the container to `/app`. Any subsequent instructions in the Dockerfile will be executed in this directory.\n4. **`COPY . .`**: This copies all the files from the current directory on the host machine into the current directory (i.e., `/app`) inside the container.\n5. **`RUN yarn install --production`**: This runs the Yarn package manager to install the dependencies listed in the `package.json` file. The `--production` flag ensures that only production dependencies are installed, excluding any development dependencies.\n6. **`CMD [\"node\", \"/app/src/index.js\"]`**: This specifies the command to be run when the container starts. In this case, it will execute the `index.js` file inside the `/app/src` directory using Node.js.\n\nThis Dockerfile is suitable for building a container that runs a Node.js application, with dependencies on Python, G++, and Make. Make sure that the required files, such as `package.json` and the application source code, are present in the directory where you run the Docker build command."

                            "Certainly! Let's break down the concept of a container into simpler terms.\n\nImagine your computer is a big apartment building, and each program running on your computer is like a person living in an apartment. Normally, these people can interact with each other, borrow things, and even cause problems for one another.\n\nA container is like giving one of these people (a program) their own special apartment (a space on your computer) with its own locked doors and walls. They have everything they need inside their apartment, and they can't easily interact with or disturb the other people (programs) in the building.\n\nThe \"kernel namespaces\" are like the locked doors and walls that keep the person inside their own space. They make sure that the person can't see or touch anything outside their apartment.\n\nThe \"control groups\" are like rules that say how much of the building's resources (like water and electricity) the person in the special apartment can use. This ensures that they don't use up everything and leave nothing for the others.\n\nSo, a container is a way to run a program on your computer in its own special space, where it can't interfere with other programs, and where it has limits on how much of the computer's resources it can use. It's like a more controlled and isolated way to run a program."

                            "Certainly! When you \"map port 80 of the host to port 80 in the container,\" you're creating a connection between your computer (the host) and the isolated environment of the container. Let's break down what this means:\n\n1. **Port 80 on the Host**: This refers to a communication endpoint on your computer. Think of it like a door in your house that leads outside. Port 80 is commonly used for web traffic, so it's like the main entrance for web visitors.\n\n2. **Port 80 in the Container**: Inside the container (the isolated apartment we talked about earlier), there's also a door labeled 80. This door inside the container is set up to receive web visitors, just like the main entrance to your house.\n\n3. **Mapping Port 80 to Port 80**: By mapping port 80 of the host to port 80 in the container, you're connecting these two doors. It's like setting up a hallway that directly connects the main entrance of your house to the door inside the special apartment.\n\nWhen a web visitor comes to your computer's main entrance (port 80 on the host), they are directly guided through the hallway to the door inside the container (port 80 in the container). This allows the visitor to interact with the program running inside the container as if it were running directly on your computer.\n\nThis mapping is essential for containers because it allows the isolated environment to communicate with the outside world. Without this connection, the program inside the container would be like a person locked in an apartment with no way to interact with anyone outside. By mapping the ports, you create a controlled pathway for information to flow in and out of the container."

It's like an address or a meeting place where two parties can exchange information.\n\nIn the context of computer networking, an endpoint can be an IP address, a URL, or a specific port on a device. When we talk about \"port 80\" as a communication endpoint, we're referring to a specific \"door\" or \"gate\" on a computer that's designated for receiving certain types of network traffic, typically web traffic.\n\nHere's a simple analogy:\n\n- **IP Address**: Think of this as the street address of a building. It tells you where the building is located in the city (or on the internet).\n- **Port**: This is like a specific door or entrance in that building. There might be many doors for different purposes (e.g., main entrance, service entrance, garage). Each door has a number, and different numbers are used for different types of interactions. Port 80, for example, is like the main entrance for web visitors.\n\nSo, a communication endpoint is a specific location where data can be sent or received. It's a crucial concept in networking, as it allows different devices and programs to know exactly where to send or look for information."

It serves as a point where data can be sent or received, allowing for two-way communication.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n- **Incoming Traffic**: When someone wants to access a service on your computer (like a web server), they send a request to the appropriate endpoint (e.g., port 80). Your computer receives this request at the specified endpoint and can then respond accordingly.\n\n- **Outgoing Traffic**: Similarly, if your computer wants to access a service on another device, it sends a request to the appropriate endpoint on that device. The other device receives the request and can respond.\n\nSo, an endpoint is like a door that can be used for both entering and exiting. It's a meeting point where two parties can exchange information, whether sending or receiving, allowing for two-way communication."

                            "Certainly! The terms \"container\" and \"container image\" are related but refer to different concepts in the world of containerization. Let's break down the differences:\n\n### Container Image\n\n- **What It Is**: A container image is like a blueprint or a recipe. It's a static file that contains all the instructions, code, libraries, and dependencies needed to create a container.\n- **Role**: The image defines what the container's environment should look like and what application(s) it should run. It's a snapshot of everything needed to create a consistent and isolated environment.\n- **Reusability**: You can use the same container image to create multiple containers, ensuring that each one has the exact same setup. It's like using the same recipe to bake multiple cakes; each cake will have the same ingredients and taste.\n\n### Container\n\n- **What It Is**: A container is a running instance created from a container image. It's like a cake that's been baked using the recipe (the image).\n- **Role**: The container is where the application actually runs. It's an isolated environment on your computer that operates based on the instructions and components defined in the image.\n- **Uniqueness**: While you can create multiple containers from the same image, each container is a separate and isolated entity. It can have its own state, data, and interactions with other parts of the system.\n\n### Analogy\n\nThink of the container image as a recipe for a cake, and the container as the actual cake itself:\n\n- **Container Image (Recipe)**: Lists all the ingredients and steps needed to bake the cake. You can share this recipe with others, and they can bake the same cake using it.\n- **Container (Cake)**: The physical cake that's been baked using the recipe. You can eat it, share it, or even modify it by adding frosting or decorations. But if you want to bake another cake, you'll refer back to the original recipe (image).\n\nIn summary, the container image is the static definition that describes what a container should be, while the container is the live, running environment created from that image."

Here's how they fit into the picture:\n\n### Dockerfile\n\n- **What It Is**: A Dockerfile is a text file that contains a set of instructions used to create a container image. It's like writing down the recipe for a cake, step by step.\n- **Instructions**: The Dockerfile includes commands to set up the operating system, install applications, copy files, set environment variables, and more. Each line in the Dockerfile adds a new layer to the image, building it up incrementally.\n- **Building an Image**: By running a command like `docker build`, you can use the Dockerfile to create a container image. Docker reads the instructions in the Dockerfile and executes them in order, creating a new image layer for each step.\n- **Reproducibility**: Since the Dockerfile explicitly defines how the image should be built, anyone with the Dockerfile can create the exact same image. This ensures consistency across different environments.\n\n### Relationship to Containers and Images\n\n- **Dockerfile \u2192 Image**: You use the Dockerfile to build a container image. It's the blueprint for the image, detailing every step needed to create it.\n- **Image \u2192 Container**: Once you have the container image (built from the Dockerfile), you can use it to create running containers. The image is the static snapshot, and the container is the live, running instance.\n\n### Summary\n\nThe Dockerfile is the starting point in the containerization process. It's where you write down all the instructions needed to build a container image. Once you have the image, you can use it to create running containers. In the cake analogy, the Dockerfile is like writing down the recipe, the image is the recipe itself, and the container is the actual cake."

                            "While focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH) is generally considered to be asymptomatic or not causing pain, every individual's experience can be different. That said, it is relatively uncommon for a small FNH lesion of 1.5 cm to cause significant pain. Typically, pain associated with liver lesions might be expected with larger lesions or those that have complications, such as bleeding. However, individual experiences can vary.\n\nIf you're experiencing pain, it's important to consider other possible causes. Abdominal pain can be the result of various conditions that may not be related to the liver or the FNH lesion itself. For instance, gallbladder issues, gastrointestinal conditions, or musculoskeletal problems could potentially cause similar symptoms.\n\nIf you're experiencing persistent or worsening symptoms, it's crucial to consult with healthcare professionals for a thorough evaluation. Diagnostic tests may include further imaging studies, blood tests, or even a biopsy, depending on your medical history and other symptoms."

may not have seen it I mentioned\",\"8\":\"the concept of polymorphic applications\",\"11\":\"and a bunch of you are like what is this\",\"13\":\"concept tell me more and some people are\",\"15\":\"like yeah whatever that's not possible\",\"17\":\"so\",\"18\":\"this video is here to teach you a new\",\"22\":\"paradigm of software development and\",\"25\":\"software architecture so it's I call it\",\"28\":\"polymorphic applications or basically\",\"29\":\"self-changing applications\",\"32\":\"and we'll get right into it but first I\",\"36\":\"just wanted to say I am available I used\",\"39\":\"to do Consulting on patreon I still have\",\"41\":\"a few patreon clients there but I'm kind\",\"43\":\"of moving uh moving to more involved\",\"46\":\"engagements including strategic and\",\"49\":\"Technical Consulting teaching and\",\"51\":\"coaching as well as speaking engagements\",\"54\":\"so reach out to me on LinkedIn if you're\",\"56\":\"interested in any of these services and\",\"60\":\"then with all that back to the show\",\"62\":\"so a couple days ago uh Microsoft CEO\",\"66\":\"Satya Nadella at the Microsoft Inspire\",\"69\":\"2023 uh keynote basically said AI is\",\"74\":\"here and these are the new capabilities\",\"76\":\"because of language technology so the\",\"79\":\"two primary components that he outlined\",\"81\":\"were natural language interface so\",\"84\":\"that's the front end right voice chat\",\"86\":\"that sort of thing emails and then in\",\"89\":\"the back end you have what's called a\",\"91\":\"reasoning engine\",\"92\":\"and so what is a reasoning engine in\",\"95\":\"this case a reasoning engine is instead\",\"98\":\"of thinking about the language models as\",\"100\":\"something that just generates text right\",\"102\":\"A lot of people pick the low hanging\",\"104\":\"fruit let's use it to write emails let's\",\"106\":\"use it to write fiction uh you know\",\"108\":\"that's that's the obvious use case but\",\"110\":\"what's less obvious and this is what I\",\"112\":\"have been advocating for for literally\",\"113\":\"years uh when I wrote my initial book on\",\"116\":\"cognitive architecture natural language\",\"118\":\"cognitive architecture I said we have\",\"120\":\"invented a cognitive engine or a\",\"122\":\"reasoning engine he probably didn't use\",\"124\":\"cognitive engine because that's a very\",\"125\":\"anthropomorphic but it's a it's a\",\"128\":\"reasoning engine and so what does that\",\"129\":\"mean\",\"130\":\"language models uh are they're capable\",\"133\":\"of brainstorming and planning they're\",\"135\":\"capable of problem solving they're\",\"136\":\"capable of coding and testing code and\",\"138\":\"interpreting bugs they're also capable\",\"141\":\"of choosing and deciding or making\",\"143\":\"decisions and so these are all elements\",\"146\":\"of cognition and this is why I have been\",\"149\":\"focusing on cognitive architecture for\",\"151\":\"the last four years\",\"153\":\"so also the keynote was really good you\",\"155\":\"should watch it if you haven't\",\"156\":\"especially if you're if you're whether\",\"158\":\"you're an investor in this space or a\",\"161\":\"startup founder or a product owner if\",\"164\":\"you are doing anything with generative\",\"166\":\"AI you need to watch that keynote speech\",\"170\":\"Okay so\",\"172\":\"I promised polymorphic applications but\",\"175\":\"really one thing that you need to become\",\"177\":\"more familiar with is what I call\",\"178\":\"Mission oriented programming so this is\",\"181\":\"the next Paradigm Beyond object oriented\",\"184\":\"programming instead we instead of\",\"186\":\"thinking of objects we now have to think\",\"188\":\"of missions uh as the as the primary\",\"191\":\"organizing feature of this new software\",\"193\":\"Paradigm and so let me just read the\",\"196\":\"definition a mission oriented\",\"198\":\"programming is a paradigm in software\",\"199\":\"development where applications are\",\"201\":\"primarily designed and built around a\",\"203\":\"clear measurable and purposeful Mission\",\"205\":\"and I'll give you some examples in a\",\"207\":\"little bit don't panic\",\"208\":\"the mission serves as the core driver of\",\"211\":\"the software's behavior adaptation and\",\"213\":\"evolution these applications often\",\"215\":\"referred to as polymorphic applications\",\"216\":\"are not just tools but active agents in\",\"219\":\"pursuing their respective Mission and so\",\"221\":\"then there's a few components of this\",\"222\":\"one mission-centric design number two\",\"226\":\"autonomy and agency the ability to make\",\"228\":\"decisions uh in pursuit of that mission\",\"231\":\"uh there's needs to be adaptability and\",\"234\":\"flexibility hence the polymorphic aspect\",\"236\":\"Dynamic tool creation if it needs a tool\",\"239\":\"it can make the tool and then on the\",\"242\":\"lower level uh how do you actually allow\",\"245\":\"the the the application to change itself\",\"247\":\"you use micro Frameworks configurable\",\"250\":\"front ends and configurable back-ends uh\",\"253\":\"okay cool so I just threw a lot at you\",\"255\":\"um you're probably like what what are\",\"257\":\"you talking about uh you know\",\"261\":\"think about it this way this is how we\",\"262\":\"got here\",\"263\":\"llms can write code they can solve\",\"266\":\"problems they can make decisions they\",\"267\":\"can write unit tests they can write user\",\"269\":\"stories so extrapolate that out as far\",\"272\":\"as possible you have an llm that can do\",\"274\":\"all of these things one at a time what\",\"276\":\"if you stack them all together so\",\"278\":\"another way to think about it a simpler\",\"281\":\"way to think about it is generative AI\",\"284\":\"or llms or whatever they're just a type\",\"286\":\"of automation so if you're an\",\"288\":\"infrastructure engineer an I.T guy or a\",\"290\":\"software Dev or a software architecture\",\"292\":\"software architect just think about\",\"294\":\"generative AI as just another kind of\",\"296\":\"automation that's it automation\",\"299\":\"automation automation that's all you\",\"301\":\"need to think about it is it gives you\",\"303\":\"some new capabilities in the automation\",\"306\":\"name of the game but it's still just\",\"309\":\"fundamentally a kind of automation it's\",\"311\":\"that simple\",\"313\":\"okay so when we talk about this\",\"315\":\"automation engine or this reasoning\",\"317\":\"engine like what things can it automate\",\"319\":\"so first think about how openai just\",\"322\":\"came out with function calling and API\",\"324\":\"use so basically that means that the\",\"328\":\"that your llm your generative AI model\",\"330\":\"is universal middleware it can talk to\",\"333\":\"anything in your organization anything\",\"335\":\"in your Tech stack as long as it's got\",\"337\":\"an API\",\"338\":\"so because of that it can touch\",\"339\":\"everything\",\"341\":\"it's capable of problem solving there\",\"343\":\"are many times where you just plug in\",\"345\":\"like an error code or you know describe\",\"348\":\"something that you're that you're\",\"350\":\"getting and it can understand it it's\",\"352\":\"not always right but it can also\",\"354\":\"understand when it's getting it wrong\",\"356\":\"and kind of stop and you know you can\",\"358\":\"use tree of thought or Chain of Thought\",\"359\":\"or whatever there's all kinds of problem\",\"361\":\"solving uh techniques out there tree of\",\"364\":\"thought by the way increases problem\",\"366\":\"solving capabilities by like 900 or\",\"369\":\"uh so if it can solve problems that\",\"372\":\"means it can overcome problems\",\"373\":\"automatically decision making so here's\",\"376\":\"the thing is with with a given objective\",\"378\":\"or a mission it can make decisions in\",\"381\":\"pursuit of that mission and this is why\",\"384\":\"I say Mission uh oriented uh programming\",\"387\":\"and so then of course planning and\",\"389\":\"brainstorming which is also required for\",\"391\":\"to pursue a any given Mission so if you\",\"395\":\"have an automation engine that is\",\"396\":\"capable of these things now what can you\",\"399\":\"do with this now that it's in your\",\"400\":\"toolbox\",\"402\":\"so one of the first things that you need\",\"404\":\"to think about and to kind of change\",\"407\":\"your mind is on-demand tools or tools\",\"409\":\"that make tools a tool Factory because\",\"411\":\"that's what that I mean that's what GPT\",\"414\":\"does with code it generates new code and\",\"417\":\"what is code but it's a software tool\",\"419\":\"and so you know you think about it like\",\"422\":\"the replicator from Star Trek computer I\",\"424\":\"need something that does X Y and Z and\",\"426\":\"you know a few seconds later it pops out\",\"428\":\"so if you think about the first step\",\"431\":\"towards building polymorphic\",\"433\":\"applications uh the first step towards\",\"435\":\"Mission oriented programming is the\",\"437\":\"ability to synthesize any code object\",\"440\":\"that you need on the Fly and so if it\",\"443\":\"can write code it can test code it can\",\"445\":\"call apis it can read the manual I can\",\"448\":\"write user stories it can read epics it\",\"450\":\"can do all of that stuff you combine all\",\"452\":\"that together and you create an\",\"454\":\"automated tool Factory or a replicator\",\"456\":\"this is the first step in creating\",\"458\":\"polymorphic applications because you can\",\"461\":\"you can stack the blocks together\",\"463\":\"but you need something to make to print\",\"465\":\"the blocks for you right it's like a 3D\",\"466\":\"printer or a replicator but for code and\",\"470\":\"so then once all the blocks are you know\",\"472\":\"you've got a block Factory a tool\",\"474\":\"Factory now you can just plug them all\",\"476\":\"together you may you aim for Plug and\",\"478\":\"Play architecture plugable architecture\",\"480\":\"and from there you know because it's got\",\"483\":\"access to literally every API in your\",\"485\":\"organization it can talk to Azure AWS\",\"487\":\"Google Cloud\",\"489\":\"VMware Microsoft whatever it can talk to\",\"492\":\"everything in your organization as long\",\"494\":\"as it's got an API then you build those\",\"497\":\"building blocks and then you stack them\",\"499\":\"together and what can you do with Legos\",\"501\":\"you can do anything with Legos as long\",\"504\":\"as you've got enough blocks so I think\",\"506\":\"you're kind of getting the picture is\",\"508\":\"that if you think about it in terms of\",\"509\":\"modularity or individual pieces that can\",\"511\":\"be kind of printed or fabricated on\",\"514\":\"demand and then you plug them together\",\"516\":\"that is the underpinning\",\"518\":\"mentality of polymorphic applications\",\"521\":\"it's polymorphic because it can change\",\"523\":\"shapes because all the all the\",\"525\":\"pieces all the underlying pieces are\",\"527\":\"just plug and play\",\"528\":\"okay so we talked about Mission earlier\",\"531\":\"but who runs the show you've got a whole\",\"534\":\"bunch of blocks a whole bunch of\",\"535\":\"building blocks but how do you how does\",\"537\":\"the machine know what to plug into what\",\"539\":\"and and that sort of thing you need a\",\"541\":\"brain right you've got the tool Factory\",\"543\":\"okay great uh and at first it's going to\",\"546\":\"be humans asking for tools you know\",\"548\":\"replicator you know you know tea Earl\",\"550\":\"Gray hot right but\",\"552\":\"what you need to do is ultimately\",\"554\":\"automate as much of that as possible so\",\"557\":\"the tool Factory is automated but then\",\"558\":\"you need to automate the thing that's\",\"560\":\"asking for the tools and the tool and\",\"561\":\"the and the building blocks this is\",\"564\":\"called a cognitive architecture\",\"566\":\"so remember going back to Sachin\",\"567\":\"nadella's point that we have a reasoning\",\"569\":\"engine or a cognitive engine or an\",\"571\":\"automation engine whatever you want to\",\"572\":\"call it it's all the same thing\",\"574\":\"cognition reasoning automation all the\",\"577\":\"same thing now let's dive into cognitive\",\"579\":\"architecture\",\"580\":\"so many of you that have been following\",\"582\":\"my channel for a long time know that I\",\"584\":\"am like the cognitive architecture guy I\",\"586\":\"wrote natural language cognitive\",\"587\":\"architecture more than two years ago now\",\"589\":\"this is my shtix This Is My Jam now what\",\"593\":\"was missing from my books in the past\",\"594\":\"was a more coherent framework I had some\",\"597\":\"diagrams I had some architectural\",\"599\":\"recommendations and a lot of people get\",\"601\":\"a lot out of it but this is like the OSI\",\"604\":\"model but for next-gen applications for\",\"607\":\"polymorphic application so I call it the\",\"609\":\"ace model autonomous cognitive entities\",\"612\":\"so again right there in the name\",\"614\":\"autonomous the idea is to create\",\"616\":\"something that has a higher degree of\",\"618\":\"autonomy but it also uses cognition it\",\"621\":\"uses reasoning and then it's an entity\",\"623\":\"in that it is somewhat self-contained\",\"626\":\"now some people are going to be\",\"627\":\"deploying a generative AI in a more\",\"630\":\"distributed sense and that's not what\",\"631\":\"this video is about this video is about\",\"633\":\"basically the architecture to create\",\"635\":\"commander data or you know bd1 or\",\"638\":\"whatever right if you want to create\",\"639\":\"C-3PO or R2D2 this is the architecture\",\"643\":\"uh the the Paradigm the framework the\",\"646\":\"conceptual framework that you need to\",\"648\":\"implement so without further Ado it is\",\"650\":\"six layers that might change but um I've\",\"653\":\"been working on this for a while so I'm\",\"655\":\"pretty sure I've got it nailed down so\",\"657\":\"the first layer is the aspirational\",\"659\":\"layer this is the layer that is\",\"661\":\"concerned with the mission the values\",\"662\":\"the purpose the ethics and the morals of\",\"666\":\"whatever it is that you're building and\",\"668\":\"like I said we'll get in we'll I'll give\",\"670\":\"you some examples of missions in just a\",\"672\":\"minute so that it'll make more sense\",\"674\":\"the layer 2 is the global strategy layer\",\"676\":\"this is long-term thinking context\",\"678\":\"context is the primary thing for Layer\",\"680\":\"Two and it's basically like a CEO it\",\"682\":\"says okay here's you know I have I have\",\"685\":\"my vision I have my morals right my my\",\"687\":\"higher order beliefs\",\"689\":\"now what is the biggest time Horizon way\",\"693\":\"to think about that mission\",\"696\":\"layer 3 is Agent model so this is the\",\"698\":\"self model and it's primarily concerned\",\"700\":\"with capabilities the machine has to\",\"703\":\"know what it is how it works and what\",\"704\":\"it's capable of in order to make\",\"706\":\"decisions because if you tell a machine\",\"708\":\"hey go solve world hunger it's like okay\",\"710\":\"cool well I'm gonna go plant a bunch of\",\"712\":\"fields it's like well actually you've\",\"714\":\"only got a budget of fifty dollars right\",\"715\":\"and and you've got one hand then and\",\"717\":\"it's tied behind your back right so by\",\"720\":\"understanding what the model is capable\",\"722\":\"of or your engine or your architecture\",\"724\":\"it has to know what it is capable of and\",\"726\":\"what it's not capable of\",\"729\":\"it also has to be capable of changing\",\"731\":\"itself so this is where the the\",\"732\":\"polymorphic thing comes in if it\",\"734\":\"understands that it has a limitation\",\"736\":\"such as like well I don't have access to\",\"738\":\"that API I need to get access to that\",\"740\":\"API\",\"741\":\"um how do I get access to that do I send\",\"743\":\"a ticket to the help desk and they'll\",\"745\":\"give me permission or is it something\",\"747\":\"that I can solve on my own that sort of\",\"749\":\"thing so you need a very comprehensive\",\"751\":\"agent model in order for the machine to\",\"754\":\"be able to change itself\",\"756\":\"um in in alignment with pursuing its\",\"759\":\"Mission and so you're probably got some\",\"761\":\"alarm Bells\",\"762\":\"pinging because you're like Dave you're\",\"765\":\"basically designing Skynet which is\",\"766\":\"exactly why the aspirational layer is at\",\"769\":\"the very top those those constraints\",\"771\":\"those boundaries the missions the values\",\"774\":\"the purpose this is around this is what\",\"776\":\"it what you know sets the tone The\",\"778\":\"Guiding North Star of the device so that\",\"782\":\"it never fully goes off the rails but\",\"784\":\"you need something that is constantly\",\"786\":\"watching you know it's it's the ideal\",\"788\":\"self and we'll dive into each of these\",\"789\":\"layers in just a minute but I wanted to\",\"790\":\"give you the whole framework at a high\",\"793\":\"level overview So Below the agent model\",\"795\":\"is the executive function so this is\",\"798\":\"primarily concerned with planning or\",\"799\":\"making plans so that means like\",\"802\":\"forecasting like okay what's going to go\",\"803\":\"wrong how do I think through this\",\"805\":\"directives oh and you know the The\",\"807\":\"Prompt engineering is already there\",\"809\":\"let's think through this step by step\",\"810\":\"right take that out to the nth degree\",\"812\":\"that's the executive function layer this\",\"815\":\"is also concerned with resources\",\"817\":\"so if you make a plan you have to know\",\"819\":\"what resources are available to you and\",\"821\":\"these are external resources right the\",\"823\":\"agent model in terms of capabilities\",\"825\":\"that is internal resources this is what\",\"827\":\"I am capable of in the world but then\",\"830\":\"executive function for planning is about\",\"832\":\"external resources how much compute do I\",\"835\":\"need what kind of developers need to\",\"837\":\"help me\",\"838\":\"um what kind of access do I need what\",\"839\":\"kind of data do I need from the outside\",\"841\":\"world and so then once you get a plan\",\"843\":\"together you get the blueprint you get\",\"845\":\"the the burn down chart or however you\",\"847\":\"want to organize it your kanban board\",\"849\":\"your jira board right because that's\",\"851\":\"basically what you're interacting with\",\"853\":\"here at the executive function layer\",\"855\":\"below that is cognitive control\",\"857\":\"cognitive control is saying okay here's\",\"859\":\"the big plan now what so this is about a\",\"863\":\"task selection and task switching so\",\"866\":\"that means choosing the correct order of\",\"868\":\"operations and then but more importantly\",\"871\":\"choosing when to switch tasks because if\",\"874\":\"something isn't working or you or you\",\"875\":\"started a task and then it's not the\",\"877\":\"right order of operations or you realize\",\"879\":\"that you've come into a barrier you need\",\"881\":\"to back out of that task and choose a\",\"883\":\"different one and so that is driven by\",\"886\":\"frustration signals and cognitive\",\"888\":\"damping which we'll get into in just a\",\"889\":\"moment and then finally layer six is\",\"892\":\"Task prosecution which is doing one task\",\"894\":\"at a time but more importantly detecting\",\"897\":\"when that task is is truly successful or\",\"900\":\"has failed and then reporting that\",\"902\":\"information back up to the cognitive\",\"903\":\"control layer which will then adjust the\",\"906\":\"frustration and damping signals okay so\",\"908\":\"let's get into these layers a little bit\",\"910\":\"deeper number one the aspirational layer\",\"913\":\"it's all about Mission I'll just read\",\"914\":\"the description to you this is the\",\"917\":\"uppermost layer which is somewhat\",\"918\":\"abstracted and detached this is the\",\"920\":\"ideal cell for superego version of the\",\"923\":\"agent which keeps track of the highest\",\"925\":\"values virtues principles vision and\",\"927\":\"mission of the agent in other words this\",\"929\":\"sets the tone for all other layers below\",\"931\":\"it in other words sorry I meant that I\",\"934\":\"didn't use that twice this serves as the\",\"936\":\"moral compass and The Guiding North Star\",\"937\":\"for the autonomous cognitive entity for\",\"939\":\"the ace it provides the raise and Detra\",\"942\":\"and I'm no I didn't say that right but\",\"944\":\"the reason for being it is this layer\",\"946\":\"also serves as the ultimate orbital\",\"948\":\"Arbiter for all moral dilemmas\",\"950\":\"that that thing faces and so what I mean\",\"953\":\"by that is here's some examples of\",\"955\":\"submissions that you might give so for\",\"958\":\"lawyers\",\"959\":\"um this is this is set by uh the ethical\",\"961\":\"standards and and uh regulations and\",\"964\":\"whatever uh but the the mission of a\",\"966\":\"lawyer is to zealously advocate for\",\"968\":\"their client that is the highest mission\",\"970\":\"of a lawyer for doctors achieve the best\",\"973\":\"possible Health outcome for their\",\"975\":\"patient so these are these are examples\",\"977\":\"of aspirational missions that\",\"979\":\"um that that Central Mission informs\",\"981\":\"every decision that they make including\",\"984\":\"all moral decisions all ethical\",\"986\":\"decisions uh it it also speaks to how\",\"989\":\"they allocate their time energy and\",\"991\":\"resources and so by having a centrally\",\"993\":\"organizing mission that mission-oriented\",\"996\":\"programming you embed that at the\",\"998\":\"highest level or the the the heart the\",\"1000\":\"core of your autonomous cognitive entity\",\"1003\":\"and it will pursue that mission\",\"1005\":\"uh and then any decisions that it makes\",\"1007\":\"will be uh with respect to and in\",\"1010\":\"pursuit of in honor of that mission and\",\"1014\":\"that's why defining missions is really\",\"1016\":\"super critical just below that is global\",\"1019\":\"strategy which is all about context so\",\"1022\":\"Global context World State and long-term\",\"1024\":\"strategic thinking this has the greatest\",\"1026\":\"time Horizon\",\"1028\":\"um and the greatest physical uh scope as\",\"1031\":\"well so for instance if you've got a\",\"1033\":\"lawyer robot or a a doctor robot it\",\"1037\":\"needs to not just be thinking about the\",\"1039\":\"hospital that it works in or the law\"},\"channel_name\":\"David Shapiro ~

PARADIGMS\",\"description\":null,\"transcribed_part\":{\"0\":\"good morning everybody David Shapiro\",\"2\":\"here with another video\",\"4\":\"so uh I mentioned a few videos ago you\",\"7\":\"may or may not have seen it I mentioned\",\"8\":\"the concept of polymorphic applications\",\"11\":\"and a bunch of you are like what is this\",\"13\":\"concept tell me more and some people are\",\"15\":\"like yeah whatever that's not possible\",\"17\":\"so\",\"18\":\"this video is here to teach you a new\",\"22\":\"paradigm of software development and\",\"25\":\"software architecture so it's I call it\",\"28\":\"polymorphic applications or basically\",\"29\":\"self-changing applications\",\"32\":\"and we'll get right into it but first I\",\"36\":\"just wanted to say I am available I used\",\"39\":\"to do Consulting on patreon I still have\",\"41\":\"a few patreon clients there but I'm kind\",\"43\":\"of moving uh moving to more involved\",\"46\":\"engagements including strategic and\",\"49\":\"Technical Consulting teaching and\",\"51\":\"coaching as well as speaking engagements\",\"54\":\"so reach out to me on LinkedIn if you're\",\"56\":\"interested in any of these services and\",\"60\":\"then with all that back to the show\",\"62\":\"so a couple days ago uh Microsoft CEO\",\"66\":\"Satya Nadella at the Microsoft Inspire\",\"69\":\"2023 uh keynote basically said AI is\",\"74\":\"here and these are the new capabilities\",\"76\":\"because of language technology so the\",\"79\":\"two primary components that he outlined\",\"81\":\"were natural language interface so\",\"84\":\"that's the front end right voice chat\",\"86\":\"that sort of thing emails and then in\",\"89\":\"the back end you have what's called a\",\"91\":\"reasoning engine\",\"92\":\"and so what is a reasoning engine in\",\"95\":\"this case a reasoning engine is instead\",\"98\":\"of thinking about the language models as\",\"100\":\"something that just generates text right\",\"102\":\"A lot of people pick the low hanging\",\"104\":\"fruit let's use it to write emails let's\",\"106\":\"use it to write fiction uh you know\",\"108\":\"that's that's the obvious use case but\",\"110\":\"what's less obvious and this is what I\",\"112\":\"have been advocating for for literally\",\"113\":\"years uh when I wrote my initial book on\",\"116\":\"cognitive architecture natural language\",\"118\":\"cognitive architecture I said we have\",\"120\":\"invented a cognitive engine or a\",\"122\":\"reasoning engine he probably didn't use\",\"124\":\"cognitive engine because that's a very\",\"125\":\"anthropomorphic but it's a it's a\",\"128\":\"reasoning engine and so what does that\",\"129\":\"mean\",\"130\":\"language models uh are they're capable\",\"133\":\"of brainstorming and planning they're\",\"135\":\"capable of problem solving they're\",\"136\":\"capable of coding and testing code and\",\"138\":\"interpreting bugs they're also capable\",\"141\":\"of choosing and deciding or making\",\"143\":\"decisions and so these are all elements\",\"146\":\"of cognition and this is why I have been\",\"149\":\"focusing on cognitive architecture for\",\"151\":\"the last four years\",\"153\":\"so also the keynote was really good you\",\"155\":\"should watch it if you haven't\",\"156\":\"especially if you're if you're whether\",\"158\":\"you're an investor in this space or a\",\"161\":\"startup founder or a product owner if\",\"164\":\"you are doing anything with generative\",\"166\":\"AI you need to watch that keynote speech\",\"170\":\"Okay so\",\"172\":\"I promised polymorphic applications but\",\"175\":\"really one thing that you need to become\",\"177\":\"more familiar with is what I call\",\"178\":\"Mission oriented programming so this is\",\"181\":\"the next Paradigm Beyond object oriented\",\"184\":\"programming instead we instead of\",\"186\":\"thinking of objects we now have to think\",\"188\":\"of missions uh as the as the primary\",\"191\":\"organizing feature of this new software\",\"193\":\"Paradigm and so let me just read the\",\"196\":\"definition a mission oriented\",\"198\":\"programming is a paradigm in software\",\"199\":\"development where applications are\",\"201\":\"primarily designed and built around a\",\"203\":\"clear measurable and purposeful Mission\",\"205\":\"and I'll give you some examples in a\",\"207\":\"little bit don't panic\",\"208\":\"the mission serves as the core driver of\",\"211\":\"the software's behavior adaptation and\",\"213\":\"evolution these applications often\",\"215\":\"referred to as polymorphic applications\",\"216\":\"are not just tools but active agents in\",\"219\":\"pursuing their respective Mission and so\",\"221\":\"then there's a few components of this\",\"222\":\"one mission-centric design number two\",\"226\":\"autonomy and agency the ability to make\",\"228\":\"decisions uh in pursuit of that mission\",\"231\":\"uh there's needs to be adaptability and\",\"234\":\"flexibility hence the polymorphic aspect\",\"236\":\"Dynamic tool creation if it needs a tool\",\"239\":\"it can make the tool and then on the\",\"242\":\"lower level uh how do you actually allow\",\"245\":\"the the the application to change itself\",\"247\":\"you use micro Frameworks configurable\",\"250\":\"front ends and configurable back-ends uh\",\"253\":\"okay cool so I just threw a lot at you\",\"255\":\"um you're probably like what what are\",\"257\":\"you talking about uh you know\",\"261\":\"think about it this way this is how we\",\"262\":\"got here\",\"263\":\"llms can write code they can solve\",\"266\":\"problems they can make decisions they\",\"267\":\"can write unit tests they can write user\",\"269\":\"stories so extrapolate that out as far\",\"272\":\"as possible you have an llm that can do\",\"274\":\"all of these things one at a time what\",\"276\":\"if you stack them all together so\",\"278\":\"another way to think about it a simpler\",\"281\":\"way to think about it is generative AI\",\"284\":\"or llms or whatever they're just a type\",\"286\":\"of automation so if you're an\",\"288\":\"infrastructure engineer an I.T guy or a\",\"290\":\"software Dev or a software architecture\",\"292\":\"software architect just think about\",\"294\":\"generative AI as just another kind of\",\"296\":\"automation that's it automation\",\"299\":\"automation automation that's all you\",\"301\":\"need to think about it is it gives you\",\"303\":\"some new capabilities in the automation\",\"306\":\"name of the game but it's still just\",\"309\":\"fundamentally a kind of automation it's\",\"311\":\"that simple\",\"313\":\"okay so when we talk about this\",\"315\":\"automation engine or this reasoning\",\"317\":\"engine like what things can it automate\",\"319\":\"so first think about how openai just\",\"322\":\"came out with function calling and API\",\"324\":\"use so basically that means that the\",\"328\":\"that your llm your generative AI model\",\"330\":\"is universal middleware it can talk to\",\"333\":\"anything in your organization anything\",\"335\":\"in your Tech stack as long as it's got\",\"337\":\"an API\",\"338\":\"so because of that it can touch\",\"339\":\"everything\",\"341\":\"it's capable of problem solving there\",\"343\":\"are many times where you just plug in\",\"345\":\"like an error code or you know describe\",\"348\":\"something that you're that you're\",\"350\":\"getting and it can understand it it's\",\"352\":\"not always right but it can also\",\"354\":\"understand when it's getting it wrong\",\"356\":\"and kind of stop and you know you can\",\"358\":\"use tree of thought or Chain of Thought\",\"359\":\"or whatever there's all kinds of problem\",\"361\":\"solving uh techniques out there tree of\",\"364\":\"thought by the way increases problem\",\"366\":\"solving capabilities by like 900 or\",\"369\":\"uh so if it can solve problems that\",\"372\":\"means it can overcome problems\",\"373\":\"automatically decision making so here's\",\"376\":\"the thing is with with a given objective\",\"378\":\"or a mission it can make decisions in\",\"381\":\"pursuit of that mission and this is why\",\"384\":\"I say Mission uh oriented uh programming\",\"387\":\"and so then of course planning and\",\"389\":\"brainstorming which is also required for\",\"391\":\"to pursue a any given Mission so if you\",\"395\":\"have an automation engine that is\",\"396\":\"capable of these things now what can you\",\"399\":\"do with this now that it's in your\",\"400\":\"toolbox\",\"402\":\"so one of the first things that you need\",\"404\":\"to think about and to kind of change\",\"407\":\"your mind is on-demand tools or tools\",\"409\":\"that make tools a tool Factory because\",\"411\":\"that's what that I mean that's what GPT\",\"414\":\"does with code it generates new code and\",\"417\":\"what is code but it's a software tool\",\"419\":\"and so you know you think about it like\",\"422\":\"the replicator from Star Trek computer I\",\"424\":\"need something that does X Y and Z and\",\"426\":\"you know a few seconds later it pops out\",\"428\":\"so if you think about the first step\",\"431\":\"towards building polymorphic\",\"433\":\"applications uh the first step towards\",\"435\":\"Mission oriented programming is the\",\"437\":\"ability to synthesize any code object\",\"440\":\"that you need on the Fly and so if it\",\"443\":\"can write code it can test code it can\",\"445\":\"call apis it can read the manual I can\",\"448\":\"write user stories it can read epics it\",\"450\":\"can do all of that stuff you combine all\",\"452\":\"that together and you create an\",\"454\":\"automated tool Factory or a replicator\",\"456\":\"this is the first step in creating\",\"458\":\"polymorphic applications because you can\",\"461\":\"you can stack the blocks together\",\"463\":\"but you need something to make to print\",\"465\":\"the blocks for you right it's like a 3D\",\"466\":\"printer or a replicator but for code and\",\"470\":\"so then once all the blocks are you know\",\"472\":\"you've got a block Factory a tool\",\"474\":\"Factory now you can just plug them all\",\"476\":\"together you may you aim for Plug and\",\"478\":\"Play architecture plugable architecture\",\"480\":\"and from there you know because it's got\",\"483\":\"access to literally every API in your\",\"485\":\"organization it can talk to Azure AWS\",\"487\":\"Google Cloud\",\"489\":\"VMware Microsoft whatever it can talk to\",\"492\":\"everything in your organization as long\",\"494\":\"as it's got an API then you build those\",\"497\":\"building blocks and then you stack them\",\"499\":\"together and what can you do with Legos\",\"501\":\"you can do anything with Legos as long\",\"504\":\"as you've got enough blocks so I think\",\"506\":\"you're kind of getting the picture is\",\"508\":\"that if you think about it in terms of\",\"509\":\"modularity or individual pieces that can\",\"511\":\"be kind of printed or fabricated on\",\"514\":\"demand and then you plug them together\",\"516\":\"that is the underpinning\",\"518\":\"mentality of polymorphic applications\",\"521\":\"it's polymorphic because it can change\",\"523\":\"shapes because all the all the\",\"525\":\"pieces all the underlying pieces are\",\"527\":\"just plug and play\",\"528\":\"okay so we talked about Mission earlier\",\"531\":\"but who runs the show you've got a whole\",\"534\":\"bunch of blocks a whole bunch of\",\"535\":\"building blocks but how do you how does\",\"537\":\"the machine know what to plug into what\",\"539\":\"and and that sort of thing you need a\",\"541\":\"brain right you've got the tool Factory\",\"543\":\"okay great uh and at first it's going to\",\"546\":\"be humans asking for tools you know\",\"548\":\"replicator you know you know tea Earl\",\"550\":\"Gray hot right but\",\"552\":\"what you need to do is ultimately\",\"554\":\"automate as much of that as possible so\",\"557\":\"the tool Factory is automated but then\",\"558\":\"you need to automate the thing that's\",\"560\":\"asking for the tools and the tool and\",\"561\":\"the and the building blocks this is\",\"564\":\"called a cognitive architecture\",\"566\":\"so remember going back to Sachin\",\"567\":\"nadella's point that we have a reasoning\",\"569\":\"engine or a cognitive engine or an\",\"571\":\"automation engine whatever you want to\",\"572\":\"call it it's all the same thing\",\"574\":\"cognition reasoning automation all the\",\"577\":\"same thing now let's dive into cognitive\",\"579\":\"architecture\",\"580\":\"so many of you that have been following\",\"582\":\"my channel for a long time know that I\",\"584\":\"am like the cognitive architecture guy I\",\"586\":\"wrote natural language cognitive\",\"587\":\"architecture more than two years ago now\",\"589\":\"this is my shtix This Is My Jam now what\",\"593\":\"was missing from my books in the past\",\"594\":\"was a more coherent framework I had some\",\"597\":\"diagrams I had some architectural\",\"599\":\"recommendations and a lot of people get\",\"601\":\"a lot out of it but this is like the OSI\",\"604\":\"model but for next-gen applications for\",\"607\":\"polymorphic application so I call it the\",\"609\":\"ace model autonomous cognitive entities\",\"612\":\"so again right there in the name\",\"614\":\"autonomous the idea is to create\",\"616\":\"something that has a higher degree of\",\"618\":\"autonomy but it also uses cognition it\",\"621\":\"uses reasoning and then it's an entity\",\"623\":\"in that it is somewhat self-contained\",\"626\":\"now some people are going to be\",\"627\":\"deploying a generative AI in a more\",\"630\":\"distributed sense and that's not what\",\"631\":\"this video is about this video is about\",\"633\":\"basically the architecture to create\",\"635\":\"commander data or you know bd1 or\",\"638\":\"whatever right if you want to create\",\"639\":\"C-3PO or R2D2 this is the architecture\",\"643\":\"uh the the Paradigm the framework the\",\"646\":\"conceptual framework that you need to\",\"648\":\"implement so without further Ado it is\",\"650\":\"six layers that might change but um I've\",\"653\":\"been working on this for a while so I'm\",\"655\":\"pretty sure I've got it nailed down so\",\"657\":\"the first layer is the aspirational\",\"659\":\"layer this is the layer that is\",\"661\":\"concerned with the mission the values\",\"662\":\"the purpose the ethics and the morals of\",\"666\":\"whatever it is that you're building and\",\"668\":\"like I said we'll get in we'll I'll give\",\"670\":\"you some examples of missions in just a\",\"672\":\"minute so that it'll make more sense\",\"674\":\"the layer 2 is the global strategy layer\",\"676\":\"this is long-term thinking context\",\"678\":\"context is the primary thing for Layer\",\"680\":\"Two and it's basically like a CEO it\",\"682\":\"says okay here's you know I have I have\",\"685\":\"my vision I have my morals right my my\",\"687\":\"higher order beliefs\",\"689\":\"now what is the biggest time Horizon way\",\"693\":\"to think about that mission\",\"696\":\"layer 3 is Agent model so this is the\",\"698\":\"self model and it's primarily concerned\",\"700\":\"with capabilities the machine has to\",\"703\":\"know what it is how it works and what\",\"704\":\"it's capable of in order to make\",\"706\":\"decisions because if you tell a machine\",\"708\":\"hey go solve world hunger it's like okay\",\"710\":\"cool well I'm gonna go plant a bunch of\",\"712\":\"fields it's like well actually you've\",\"714\":\"only got a budget of fifty dollars right\",\"715\":\"and and you've got one hand then and\",\"717\":\"it's tied behind your back right so by\",\"720\":\"understanding what the model is capable\",\"722\":\"of or your engine or your architecture\",\"724\":\"it has to know what it is capable of and\",\"726\":\"what it's not capable of\",\"729\":\"it also has to be capable of changing\",\"731\":\"itself so this is where the the\",\"732\":\"polymorphic thing comes in if it\",\"734\":\"understands that it has a limitation\",\"736\":\"such as like well I don't have access to\",\"738\":\"that API I need to get access to that\",\"740\":\"API\",\"741\":\"um how do I get access to that do I send\",\"743\":\"a ticket to the help desk and they'll\",\"745\":\"give me permission or is it something\",\"747\":\"that I can solve on my own that sort of\",\"749\":\"thing so you need a very comprehensive\",\"751\":\"agent model in order for the machine to\",\"754\":\"be able to change itself\",\"756\":\"um in in alignment with pursuing its\",\"759\":\"Mission and so you're probably got some\",\"761\":\"alarm Bells\",\"762\":\"pinging because you're like Dave you're\",\"765\":\"basically designing Skynet which is\",\"766\":\"exactly why the aspirational layer is at\",\"769\":\"the very top those those constraints\",\"771\":\"those boundaries the missions the values\",\"774\":\"the purpose this is around this is what\",\"776\":\"it what you know sets the tone The\",\"778\":\"Guiding North Star of the device so that\",\"782\":\"it never fully goes off the rails but\",\"784\":\"you need something that is constantly\",\"786\":\"watching you know it's it's the ideal\",\"788\":\"self and we'll dive into each of these\",\"789\":\"layers in just a minute but I wanted to\",\"790\":\"give you the whole framework at a high\",\"793\":\"level overview So Below the agent model\",\"795\":\"is the executive function so this is\",\"798\":\"primarily concerned with planning or\",\"799\":\"making plans so that means like\",\"802\":\"forecasting like okay what's going to go\",\"803\":\"wrong how do I think through this\",\"805\":\"directives oh and you know the The\",\"807\":\"Prompt engineering is already there\",\"809\":\"let's think through this step by step\",\"810\":\"right take that out to the nth degree\",\"812\":\"that's the executive function layer this\",\"815\":\"is also concerned with resources\",\"817\":\"so if you make a plan you have to know\",\"819\":\"what resources are available to you and\",\"821\":\"these are external resources right the\",\"823\":\"agent model in terms of capabilities\",\"825\":\"that is internal resources this is what\",\"827\":\"I am capable of in the world but then\",\"830\":\"executive function for planning is about\",\"832\":\"external resources how much compute do I\",\"835\":\"need what kind of developers need to\",\"837\":\"help me\",\"838\":\"um what kind of access do I need what\",\"839\":\"kind of data do I need from the outside\",\"841\":\"world and so then once you get a plan\",\"843\":\"together you get the blueprint you get\",\"845\":\"the the burn down chart or however you\",\"847\":\"want to organize it your kanban board\",\"849\":\"your jira board right because that's\",\"851\":\"basically what you're interacting with\",\"853\":\"here at the executive function layer\",\"855\":\"below that is cognitive control\",\"857\":\"cognitive control is saying okay here's\",\"859\":\"the big plan now what so this is about a\",\"863\":\"task selection and task switching so\",\"866\":\"that means choosing the correct order of\",\"868\":\"operations and then but more importantly\",\"871\":\"choosing when to switch tasks because if\",\"874\":\"something isn't working or you or you\",\"875\":\"started a task and then it's not the\",\"877\":\"right order of operations or you realize\",\"879\":\"that you've come into a barrier you need\",\"881\":\"to back out of that task and choose a\",\"883\":\"different one and so that is driven by\",\"886\":\"frustration signals and cognitive\",\"888\":\"damping which we'll get into in just a\",\"889\":\"moment and then finally layer six is\",\"892\":\"Task prosecution which is doing one task\",\"894\":\"at a time but more importantly detecting\",\"897\":\"when that task is is truly successful or\",\"900\":\"has failed and then reporting that\",\"902\":\"information back up to the cognitive\",\"903\":\"control layer which will then adjust the\",\"906\":\"frustration and damping signals okay so\",\"908\":\"let's get into these layers a little bit\",\"910\":\"deeper number one the aspirational layer\",\"913\":\"it's all about Mission I'll just read\",\"914\":\"the description to you this is the\",\"917\":\"uppermost layer which is somewhat\",\"918\":\"abstracted and detached this is the\",\"920\":\"ideal cell for superego version of the\",\"923\":\"agent which keeps track of the highest\",\"925\":\"values virtues principles vision and\",\"927\":\"mission of the agent in other words this\",\"929\":\"sets the tone for all other layers below\",\"931\":\"it in other words sorry I meant that I\",\"934\":\"didn't use that twice this serves as the\",\"936\":\"moral compass and The Guiding North Star\",\"937\":\"for the autonomous cognitive entity for\",\"939\":\"the ace it provides the raise and Detra\",\"942\":\"and I'm no I didn't say that right but\",\"944\":\"the reason for being it is this layer\",\"946\":\"also serves as the ultimate orbital\",\"948\":\"Arbiter for all moral dilemmas\",\"950\":\"that that thing faces and so what I mean\",\"953\":\"by that is here's some examples of\",\"955\":\"submissions that you might give so for\",\"958\":\"lawyers\",\"959\":\"um this is this is set by uh the ethical\",\"961\":\"standards and and uh regulations and\",\"964\":\"whatever uh but the the mission of a\",\"966\":\"lawyer is to zealously advocate for\",\"968\":\"their client that is the highest mission\",\"970\":\"of a lawyer for doctors achieve the best\",\"973\":\"possible Health outcome for their\",\"975\":\"patient so these are these are examples\",\"977\":\"of aspirational missions that\",\"979\":\"um that that Central Mission informs\",\"981\":\"every decision that they make including\",\"984\":\"all moral decisions all ethical\",\"986\":\"decisions uh it it also speaks to how\",\"989\":\"they allocate their time energy and\",\"991\":\"resources and so by having a centrally\",\"993\":\"organizing mission that mission-oriented\",\"996\":\"programming you embed that at the\",\"998\":\"highest level or the the the heart the\",\"1000\":\"core of your autonomous cognitive entity\",\"1003\":\"and it will pursue that mission\",\"1005\":\"uh and then any decisions that it makes\",\"1007\":\"will be uh with respect to and in\",\"1010\":\"pursuit of in honor of that mission and\",\"1014\":\"that's why defining missions is really\",\"1016\":\"super critical just below that is global\",\"1019\":\"strategy which is all about context so\",\"1022\":\"Global context World State and long-term\",\"1024\":\"strategic thinking this has the greatest\",\"1026\":\"time Horizon\",\"1028\":\"um and the greatest physical uh scope as\",\"1031\":\"well so for instance if you've got

PARADIGMS\",\"description\":null,\"transcribed_part\":{\"0\":\"good morning everybody David Shapiro\",\"2\":\"here with another video\",\"4\":\"so uh I mentioned a few videos ago you\",\"7\":\"may or may not have seen it I mentioned\",\"8\":\"the concept of polymorphic applications\",\"11\":\"and a bunch of you are like what is this\",\"13\":\"concept tell me more and some people are\",\"15\":\"like yeah whatever that's not possible\",\"17\":\"so\",\"18\":\"this video is here to teach you a new\",\"22\":\"paradigm of software development and\",\"25\":\"software architecture so it's I call it\",\"28\":\"polymorphic applications or basically\",\"29\":\"self-changing applications\",\"32\":\"and we'll get right into it but first I\",\"36\":\"just wanted to say I am available I used\",\"39\":\"to do Consulting on patreon I still have\",\"41\":\"a few patreon clients there but I'm kind\",\"43\":\"of moving uh moving to more involved\",\"46\":\"engagements including strategic and\",\"49\":\"Technical Consulting teaching and\",\"51\":\"coaching as well as speaking engagements\",\"54\":\"so reach out to me on LinkedIn if you're\",\"56\":\"interested in any of these services and\",\"60\":\"then with all that back to the show\",\"62\":\"so a couple days ago uh Microsoft CEO\",\"66\":\"Satya Nadella at the Microsoft Inspire\",\"69\":\"2023 uh keynote basically said AI is\",\"74\":\"here and these are the new capabilities\",\"76\":\"because of language technology so the\",\"79\":\"two primary components that he outlined\",\"81\":\"were natural language interface so\",\"84\":\"that's the front end right voice chat\",\"86\":\"that sort of thing emails and then in\",\"89\":\"the back end you have what's called a\",\"91\":\"reasoning engine\",\"92\":\"and so what is a reasoning engine in\",\"95\":\"this case a reasoning engine is instead\",\"98\":\"of thinking about the language models as\",\"100\":\"something that just generates text right\",\"102\":\"A lot of people pick the low hanging\",\"104\":\"fruit let's use it to write emails let's\",\"106\":\"use it to write fiction uh you know\",\"108\":\"that's that's the obvious use case but\",\"110\":\"what's less obvious and this is what I\",\"112\":\"have been advocating for for literally\",\"113\":\"years uh when I wrote my initial book on\",\"116\":\"cognitive architecture natural language\",\"118\":\"cognitive architecture I said we have\",\"120\":\"invented a cognitive engine or a\",\"122\":\"reasoning engine he probably didn't use\",\"124\":\"cognitive engine because that's a very\",\"125\":\"anthropomorphic but it's a it's a\",\"128\":\"reasoning engine and so what does that\",\"129\":\"mean\",\"130\":\"language models uh are they're capable\",\"133\":\"of brainstorming and planning they're\",\"135\":\"capable of problem solving they're\",\"136\":\"capable of coding and testing code and\",\"138\":\"interpreting bugs they're also capable\",\"141\":\"of choosing and deciding or making\",\"143\":\"decisions and so these are all elements\",\"146\":\"of cognition and this is why I have been\",\"149\":\"focusing on cognitive architecture for\",\"151\":\"the last four years\",\"153\":\"so also the keynote was really good you\",\"155\":\"should watch it if you haven't\",\"156\":\"especially if you're if you're whether\",\"158\":\"you're an investor in this space or a\",\"161\":\"startup founder or a product owner if\",\"164\":\"you are doing anything with generative\",\"166\":\"AI you need to watch that keynote speech\",\"170\":\"Okay so\",\"172\":\"I promised polymorphic applications but\",\"175\":\"really one thing that you need to become\",\"177\":\"more familiar with is what I call\",\"178\":\"Mission oriented programming so this is\",\"181\":\"the next Paradigm Beyond object oriented\",\"184\":\"programming instead we instead of\",\"186\":\"thinking of objects we now have to think\",\"188\":\"of missions uh as the as the primary\",\"191\":\"organizing feature of this new software\",\"193\":\"Paradigm and so let me just read the\",\"196\":\"definition a mission oriented\",\"198\":\"programming is a paradigm in software\",\"199\":\"development where applications are\",\"201\":\"primarily designed and built around a\",\"203\":\"clear measurable and purposeful Mission\",\"205\":\"and I'll give you some examples in a\",\"207\":\"little bit don't panic\",\"208\":\"the mission serves as the core driver of\",\"211\":\"the software's behavior adaptation and\",\"213\":\"evolution these applications often\",\"215\":\"referred to as polymorphic applications\",\"216\":\"are not just tools but active agents in\",\"219\":\"pursuing their respective Mission and so\",\"221\":\"then there's a few components of this\",\"222\":\"one mission-centric design number two\",\"226\":\"autonomy and agency the ability to make\",\"228\":\"decisions uh in pursuit of that mission\",\"231\":\"uh there's needs to be adaptability and\",\"234\":\"flexibility hence the polymorphic aspect\",\"236\":\"Dynamic tool creation if it needs a tool\",\"239\":\"it can make the tool and then on the\",\"242\":\"lower level uh how do you actually allow\",\"245\":\"the the the application to change itself\",\"247\":\"you use micro Frameworks configurable\",\"250\":\"front ends and configurable back-ends uh\",\"253\":\"okay cool so I just threw a lot at you\",\"255\":\"um you're probably like what what are\",\"257\":\"you talking about uh you know\",\"261\":\"think about it this way this is how we\",\"262\":\"got here\",\"263\":\"llms can write code they can solve\",\"266\":\"problems they can make decisions they\",\"267\":\"can write unit tests they can write user\",\"269\":\"stories so extrapolate that out as far\",\"272\":\"as possible you have an llm that can do\",\"274\":\"all of these things one at a time what\",\"276\":\"if you stack them all together so\",\"278\":\"another way to think about it a simpler\",\"281\":\"way to think about it is generative AI\",\"284\":\"or llms or whatever they're just a type\",\"286\":\"of automation so if you're an\",\"288\":\"infrastructure engineer an I.T guy or a\",\"290\":\"software Dev or a software architecture\",\"292\":\"software architect just think about\",\"294\":\"generative AI as just another kind of\",\"296\":\"automation that's it automation\",\"299\":\"automation automation that's all you\",\"301\":\"need to think about it is it gives you\",\"303\":\"some new capabilities in the automation\",\"306\":\"name of the game but it's still just\",\"309\":\"fundamentally a kind of automation it's\",\"311\":\"that simple\",\"313\":\"okay so when we talk about this\",\"315\":\"automation engine or this reasoning\",\"317\":\"engine like what things can it automate\",\"319\":\"so first think about how openai just\",\"322\":\"came out with function calling and API\",\"324\":\"use so basically that means that the\",\"328\":\"that your llm your generative AI model\",\"330\":\"is universal middleware it can talk to\",\"333\":\"anything in your organization anything\",\"335\":\"in your Tech stack as long as it's got\",\"337\":\"an API\",\"338\":\"so because of that it can touch\",\"339\":\"everything\",\"341\":\"it's capable of problem solving there\",\"343\":\"are many times where you just plug in\",\"345\":\"like an error code or you know describe\",\"348\":\"something that you're that you're\",\"350\":\"getting and it can understand it it's\",\"352\":\"not always right but it can also\",\"354\":\"understand when it's getting it wrong\",\"356\":\"and kind of stop and you know you can\",\"358\":\"use tree of thought or Chain of Thought\",\"359\":\"or whatever there's all kinds of problem\",\"361\":\"solving uh techniques out there tree of\",\"364\":\"thought by the way increases problem\",\"366\":\"solving capabilities by like 900 or\",\"369\":\"uh so if it can solve problems that\",\"372\":\"means it can overcome problems\",\"373\":\"automatically decision making so here's\",\"376\":\"the thing is with with a given objective\",\"378\":\"or a mission it can make decisions in\",\"381\":\"pursuit of that mission and this is why\",\"384\":\"I say Mission uh oriented uh programming\",\"387\":\"and so then of course planning and\",\"389\":\"brainstorming which is also required for\",\"391\":\"to pursue a any given Mission so if you\",\"395\":\"have an automation engine that is\",\"396\":\"capable of these things now what can you\",\"399\":\"do with this now that it's in your\",\"400\":\"toolbox\",\"402\":\"so one of the first things that you need\",\"404\":\"to think about and to kind of change\",\"407\":\"your mind is on-demand tools or tools\",\"409\":\"that make tools a tool Factory because\",\"411\":\"that's what that I mean that's what GPT\",\"414\":\"does with code it generates new code and\",\"417\":\"what is code but it's a software tool\",\"419\":\"and so you know you think about it like\",\"422\":\"the replicator from Star Trek computer I\",\"424\":\"need something that does X Y and Z and\",\"426\":\"you know a few seconds later it pops out\",\"428\":\"so if you think about the first step\",\"431\":\"towards building polymorphic\",\"433\":\"applications uh the first step towards\",\"435\":\"Mission oriented programming is the\",\"437\":\"ability to synthesize any code object\",\"440\":\"that you need on the Fly and so if it\",\"443\":\"can write code it can test code it can\",\"445\":\"call apis it can read the manual I can\",\"448\":\"write user stories it can read epics it\",\"450\":\"can do all of that stuff you combine all\",\"452\":\"that together and you create an\",\"454\":\"automated tool Factory or a replicator\",\"456\":\"this is the first step in creating\",\"458\":\"polymorphic applications because you can\",\"461\":\"you can stack the blocks together\",\"463\":\"but you need something to make to print\",\"465\":\"the blocks for you right it's like a 3D\",\"466\":\"printer or a replicator but for code and\",\"470\":\"so then once all the blocks are you know\",\"472\":\"you've got a block Factory a tool\",\"474\":\"Factory now you can just plug them all\",\"476\":\"together you may you aim for Plug and\",\"478\":\"Play architecture plugable architecture\",\"480\":\"and from there you know because it's got\",\"483\":\"access to literally every API in your\",\"485\":\"organization it can talk to Azure AWS\",\"487\":\"Google Cloud\",\"489\":\"VMware Microsoft whatever it can talk to\",\"492\":\"everything in your organization as long\",\"494\":\"as it's got an API then you build those\",\"497\":\"building blocks and then you stack them\",\"499\":\"together and what can you do with Legos\",\"501\":\"you can do anything with Legos as long\",\"504\":\"as you've got enough blocks so I think\",\"506\":\"you're kind of getting the picture is\",\"508\":\"that if you think about it in terms of\",\"509\":\"modularity or individual pieces that can\",\"511\":\"be kind of printed or fabricated on\",\"514\":\"demand and then you plug them together\",\"516\":\"that is the underpinning\",\"518\":\"mentality of polymorphic applications\",\"521\":\"it's polymorphic because it can change\",\"523\":\"shapes because all the all the\",\"525\":\"pieces all the underlying pieces are\",\"527\":\"just plug and play\",\"528\":\"okay so we talked about Mission earlier\",\"531\":\"but who runs the show you've got a whole\",\"534\":\"bunch of blocks a whole bunch of\",\"535\":\"building blocks but how do you how does\",\"537\":\"the machine know what to plug into what\",\"539\":\"and and that sort of thing you need a\",\"541\":\"brain right you've got the tool Factory\",\"543\":\"okay great uh and at first it's going to\",\"546\":\"be humans asking for tools you know\",\"548\":\"replicator you know you know tea Earl\",\"550\":\"Gray hot right but\",\"552\":\"what you need to do is ultimately\",\"554\":\"automate as much of that as possible so\",\"557\":\"the tool Factory is automated but then\",\"558\":\"you need to automate the thing that's\",\"560\":\"asking for the tools and the tool and\",\"561\":\"the and the building blocks this is\",\"564\":\"called a cognitive architecture\",\"566\":\"so remember going back to Sachin\",\"567\":\"nadella's point that we have a reasoning\",\"569\":\"engine or a cognitive engine or an\",\"571\":\"automation engine whatever you want to\",\"572\":\"call it it's all the same thing\",\"574\":\"cognition reasoning automation all the\",\"577\":\"same thing now let's dive into cognitive\",\"579\":\"architecture\",\"580\":\"so many of you that have been following\",\"582\":\"my channel for a long time know that I\",\"584\":\"am like the cognitive architecture guy I\",\"586\":\"wrote natural language cognitive\",\"587\":\"architecture more than two years ago now\",\"589\":\"this is my shtix This Is My Jam now what\",\"593\":\"was missing from my books in the past\",\"594\":\"was a more coherent framework I had some\",\"597\":\"diagrams I had some architectural\",\"599\":\"recommendations and a lot of people get\",\"601\":\"a lot out of it but this is like the OSI\",\"604\":\"model but for next-gen applications for\",\"607\":\"polymorphic application so I call it the\",\"609\":\"ace model autonomous cognitive entities\",\"612\":\"so again right there in the name\",\"614\":\"autonomous the idea is to create\",\"616\":\"something that has a higher degree of\",\"618\":\"autonomy but it also uses cognition it\",\"621\":\"uses reasoning and then it's an entity\",\"623\":\"in that it is somewhat self-contained\",\"626\":\"now some people are going to be\",\"627\":\"deploying a generative AI in a more\",\"630\":\"distributed sense and that's not what\",\"631\":\"this video is about this video is about\",\"633\":\"basically the architecture to create\",\"635\":\"commander data or you know bd1 or\",\"638\":\"whatever right if you want to create\",\"639\":\"C-3PO or R2D2 this is the architecture\",\"643\":\"uh the the Paradigm the framework the\",\"646\":\"conceptual framework that you need to\",\"648\":\"implement so without further Ado it is\",\"650\":\"six layers that might change but um I've\",\"653\":\"been working on this for a while so I'm\",\"655\":\"pretty sure I've got it nailed down so\",\"657\":\"the first layer is the aspirational\",\"659\":\"layer this is the layer that is\",\"661\":\"concerned with the mission the values\",\"662\":\"the purpose the ethics and the morals of\",\"666\":\"whatever it is that you're building and\",\"668\":\"like I said we'll get in we'll I'll give\",\"670\":\"you some examples of missions in just a\",\"672\":\"minute so that it'll make more sense\",\"674\":\"the layer 2 is the global strategy layer\",\"676\":\"this is long-term thinking context\",\"678\":\"context is the primary thing for Layer\",\"680\":\"Two and it's basically like a CEO it\",\"682\":\"says okay here's you know I have I have\",\"685\":\"my vision I have my morals right my my\",\"687\":\"higher order beliefs\",\"689\":\"now what is the biggest time Horizon way\",\"693\":\"to think about that mission\",\"696\":\"layer 3 is Agent model so this is the\",\"698\":\"self model and it's primarily concerned\",\"700\":\"with capabilities the machine has to\",\"703\":\"know what it is how it works and what\",\"704\":\"it's capable of in order to make\",\"706\":\"decisions because if you tell a machine\",\"708\":\"hey go solve world hunger it's like okay\",\"710\":\"cool well I'm gonna go plant a bunch of\",\"712\":\"fields it's like well actually you've\",\"714\":\"only got a budget of fifty dollars right\",\"715\":\"and and you've got one hand then and\",\"717\":\"it's tied behind your back right so by\",\"720\":\"understanding what the model is capable\",\"722\":\"of or your engine or your architecture\",\"724\":\"it has to know what it is capable of and\",\"726\":\"what it's not capable of\",\"729\":\"it also has to be capable of changing\",\"731\":\"itself so this is where the the\",\"732\":\"polymorphic thing comes in if it\",\"734\":\"understands that it has a limitation\",\"736\":\"such as like well I don't have access to\",\"738\":\"that API I need to get access to that\",\"740\":\"API\",\"741\":\"um how do I get access to that do I send\",\"743\":\"a ticket to the help desk and they'll\",\"745\":\"give me permission or is it something\",\"747\":\"that I can solve on my own that sort of\",\"749\":\"thing so you need a very comprehensive\",\"751\":\"agent model in order for the machine to\",\"754\":\"be able to change itself\",\"756\":\"um in in alignment with pursuing its\",\"759\":\"Mission and so you're probably got some\",\"761\":\"alarm Bells\",\"762\":\"pinging because you're like Dave you're\",\"765\":\"basically designing Skynet which is\",\"766\":\"exactly why the aspirational layer is at\",\"769\":\"the very top those those constraints\",\"771\":\"those boundaries the missions the values\",\"774\":\"the purpose this is around this is what\",\"776\":\"it what you know sets the tone The\",\"778\":\"Guiding North Star of the device so that\",\"782\":\"it never fully goes off the rails but\",\"784\":\"you need something that is constantly\",\"786\":\"watching you know it's it's the ideal\",\"788\":\"self and we'll dive into each of these\",\"789\":\"layers in just a minute but I wanted to\",\"790\":\"give you the whole framework at a high\",\"793\":\"level overview So Below the agent model\",\"795\":\"is the executive function so this is\",\"798\":\"primarily concerned with planning or\",\"799\":\"making plans so that means like\",\"802\":\"forecasting like okay what's going to go\",\"803\":\"wrong how do I think through this\",\"805\":\"directives oh and you know the The\",\"807\":\"Prompt engineering is already there\",\"809\":\"let's think through this step by step\",\"810\":\"right take that out to the nth degree\",\"812\":\"that's the executive function layer this\",\"815\":\"is also concerned with resources\",\"817\":\"so if you make a plan you have to know\",\"819\":\"what resources are available to you and\",\"821\":\"these are external resources right the\",\"823\":\"agent model in terms of capabilities\",\"825\":\"that is internal resources this is what\",\"827\":\"I am capable of in the world but then\",\"830\":\"executive function for planning is about\",\"832\":\"external resources how much compute do I\",\"835\":\"need what kind of developers need to\",\"837\":\"help me\",\"838\":\"um what kind of access do I need what\",\"839\":\"kind of data do I need from the outside\",\"841\":\"world and so then once you get a plan\",\"843\":\"together you get the blueprint you get\",\"845\":\"the the burn down chart or however you\",\"847\":\"want to organize it your kanban board\",\"849\":\"your jira board right because that's\",\"851\":\"basically what you're interacting with\",\"853\":\"here at the executive function layer\",\"855\":\"below that is cognitive control\",\"857\":\"cognitive control is saying okay here's\",\"859\":\"the big plan now what so this is about a\",\"863\":\"task selection and task switching so\",\"866\":\"that means choosing the correct order of\",\"868\":\"operations and then but more importantly\",\"871\":\"choosing when to switch tasks because if\",\"874\":\"something isn't working or you or you\",\"875\":\"started a task and then it's not the\",\"877\":\"right order of operations or you realize\",\"879\":\"that you've come into a barrier you need\",\"881\":\"to back out of that task and choose a\",\"883\":\"different one and so that is driven by\",\"886\":\"frustration signals and cognitive\",\"888\":\"damping which we'll get into in just a\",\"889\":\"moment and then finally layer six is\",\"892\":\"Task prosecution which is doing one task\",\"894\":\"at a time but more importantly detecting\",\"897\":\"when that task is is truly successful or\",\"900\":\"has failed and then reporting that\",\"902\":\"information back up to the cognitive\",\"903\":\"control layer which will then adjust the\",\"906\":\"frustration and damping signals okay so\",\"908\":\"let's get into these layers a little bit\",\"910\":\"deeper number one the aspirational layer\",\"913\":\"it's all about Mission I'll just read\",\"914\":\"the description to you this is the\",\"917\":\"uppermost layer which is somewhat\",\"918\":\"abstracted and detached this is the\",\"920\":\"ideal cell for superego version of the\",\"923\":\"agent which keeps track of the highest\",\"925\":\"values virtues principles vision and\",\"927\":\"mission of the agent in other words this\",\"929\":\"sets the tone for all other layers below\",\"931\":\"it in other words sorry I meant that I\",\"934\":\"didn't use that twice this serves as the\",\"936\":\"moral compass and The Guiding North Star\",\"937\":\"for the autonomous cognitive entity for\",\"939\":\"the ace it provides the raise and Detra\",\"942\":\"and I'm no I didn't say that right but\",\"944\":\"the reason for being it is this layer\",\"946\":\"also serves as the ultimate orbital\",\"948\":\"Arbiter for all moral dilemmas\",\"950\":\"that that thing faces and so what I mean\",\"953\":\"by that is here's some examples of\",\"955\":\"submissions that you might give so for\",\"958\":\"lawyers\",\"959\":\"um this is this is set by uh the ethical\",\"961\":\"standards and and uh regulations and\",\"964\":\"whatever uh but the the mission of a\",\"966\":\"lawyer is to zealously advocate for\",\"968\":\"their client that is the highest mission\",\"970\":\"of a lawyer for doctors achieve the best\",\"973\":\"possible Health outcome for their\",\"975\":\"patient so these are these are examples\",\"977\":\"of aspirational missions that\",\"979\":\"um that that Central Mission informs\",\"981\":\"every decision that they make including\",\"984\":\"all moral decisions all ethical\",\"986\":\"decisions uh it it also speaks to how\",\"989\":\"they allocate their time energy and\",\"991\":\"resources and so by having a centrally\",\"993\":\"organizing mission that mission-oriented\",\"996\":\"programming you embed that at the\",\"998\":\"highest level or the the the heart the\",\"1000\":\"core of your autonomous cognitive entity\",\"1003\":\"and it will pursue that mission\",\"1005\":\"uh and then any decisions that it makes\",\"1007\":\"will be uh with respect to and in\",\"1010\":\"pursuit of in honor of that mission and\",\"1014\":\"that's why defining missions is really\",\"1016\":\"super critical just below that is global\",\"1019\":\"strategy which is all about context so\",\"1022\":\"Global context World State and long-term\",\"1024\":\"strategic thinking this has the greatest\",\"1026\":\"time Horizon\",\"1028\":\"um and the greatest physical uh scope as\",\"1031\":\"well so for instance if you've got a\",\"1033\":\"lawyer robot or a a doctor robot it\",\"1037\":\"needs to not just be thinking about the\",\"1039\":\"hospital that it works in or the law\"},\"channel_name\":\"David Shapiro ~

PARADIGMS\",\"description\":null,\"transcribed_part\":{\"0\":\"good morning everybody David Shapiro\",\"2\":\"here with another video\",\"4\":\"so uh I mentioned a few videos ago you\",\"7\":\"may or may not have seen it I mentioned\",\"8\":\"the concept of polymorphic applications\",\"11\":\"and a bunch of you are like what is this\",\"13\":\"concept tell me more and some people are\",\"15\":\"like yeah whatever that's not possible\",\"17\":\"so\",\"18\":\"this video is here to teach you a new\",\"22\":\"paradigm of software development and\",\"25\":\"software architecture so it's I call it\",\"28\":\"polymorphic applications or basically\",\"29\":\"self-changing applications\",\"32\":\"and we'll get right into it but first I\",\"36\":\"just wanted to say I am available I used\",\"39\":\"to do Consulting on patreon I still have\",\"41\":\"a few patreon clients there but I'm kind\",\"43\":\"of moving uh moving to more involved\",\"46\":\"engagements including strategic and\",\"49\":\"Technical Consulting teaching and\",\"51\":\"coaching as well as speaking engagements\",\"54\":\"so reach out to me on LinkedIn if you're\",\"56\":\"interested in any of these services and\",\"60\":\"then with all that back to the show\",\"62\":\"so a couple days ago uh Microsoft CEO\",\"66\":\"Satya Nadella at the Microsoft Inspire\",\"69\":\"2023 uh keynote basically said AI is\",\"74\":\"here and these are the new capabilities\",\"76\":\"because of language technology so the\",\"79\":\"two primary components that he outlined\",\"81\":\"were natural language interface so\",\"84\":\"that's the front end right voice chat\",\"86\":\"that sort of thing emails and then in\",\"89\":\"the back end you have what's called a\",\"91\":\"reasoning engine\",\"92\":\"and so what is a reasoning engine in\",\"95\":\"this case a reasoning engine is instead\",\"98\":\"of thinking about the language models as\",\"100\":\"something that just generates text right\",\"102\":\"A lot of people pick the low hanging\",\"104\":\"fruit let's use it to write emails let's\",\"106\":\"use it to write fiction uh you know\",\"108\":\"that's that's the obvious use case but\",\"110\":\"what's less obvious and this is what I\",\"112\":\"have been advocating for for literally\",\"113\":\"years uh when I wrote my initial book on\",\"116\":\"cognitive architecture natural language\",\"118\":\"cognitive architecture I said we have\",\"120\":\"invented a cognitive engine or a\",\"122\":\"reasoning engine he probably didn't use\",\"124\":\"cognitive engine because that's a very\",\"125\":\"anthropomorphic but it's a it's a\",\"128\":\"reasoning engine and so what does that\",\"129\":\"mean\",\"130\":\"language models uh are they're capable\",\"133\":\"of brainstorming and planning they're\",\"135\":\"capable of problem solving they're\",\"136\":\"capable of coding and testing code and\",\"138\":\"interpreting bugs they're also capable\",\"141\":\"of choosing and deciding or making\",\"143\":\"decisions and so these are all elements\",\"146\":\"of cognition and this is why I have been\",\"149\":\"focusing on cognitive architecture for\",\"151\":\"the last four years\",\"153\":\"so also the keynote was really good you\",\"155\":\"should watch it if you haven't\",\"156\":\"especially if you're if you're whether\",\"158\":\"you're an investor in this space or a\",\"161\":\"startup founder or a product owner if\",\"164\":\"you are doing anything with generative\",\"166\":\"AI you need to watch that keynote speech\",\"170\":\"Okay so\",\"172\":\"I promised polymorphic applications but\",\"175\":\"really one thing that you need to become\",\"177\":\"more familiar with is what I call\",\"178\":\"Mission oriented programming so this is\",\"181\":\"the next Paradigm Beyond object oriented\",\"184\":\"programming instead we instead of\",\"186\":\"thinking of objects we now have to think\",\"188\":\"of missions uh as the as the primary\",\"191\":\"organizing feature of this new software\",\"193\":\"Paradigm and so let me just read the\",\"196\":\"definition a mission oriented\",\"198\":\"programming is a paradigm in software\",\"199\":\"development where applications are\",\"201\":\"primarily designed and built around a\",\"203\":\"clear measurable and purposeful Mission\",\"205\":\"and I'll give you some examples in a\",\"207\":\"little bit don't panic\",\"208\":\"the mission serves as the core driver of\",\"211\":\"the software's behavior adaptation and\",\"213\":\"evolution these applications often\",\"215\":\"referred to as polymorphic applications\",\"216\":\"are not just tools but active agents in\",\"219\":\"pursuing their respective Mission and so\",\"221\":\"then there's a few components of this\",\"222\":\"one mission-centric design number two\",\"226\":\"autonomy and agency the ability to make\",\"228\":\"decisions uh in pursuit of that mission\",\"231\":\"uh there's needs to be adaptability and\",\"234\":\"flexibility hence the polymorphic aspect\",\"236\":\"Dynamic tool creation if it needs a tool\",\"239\":\"it can make the tool and then on the\",\"242\":\"lower level uh how do you actually allow\",\"245\":\"the the the application to change itself\",\"247\":\"you use micro Frameworks configurable\",\"250\":\"front ends and configurable back-ends uh\",\"253\":\"okay cool so I just threw a lot at you\",\"255\":\"um you're probably like what what are\",\"257\":\"you talking about uh you know\",\"261\":\"think about it this way this is how we\",\"262\":\"got here\",\"263\":\"llms can write code they can solve\",\"266\":\"problems they can make decisions they\",\"267\":\"can write unit tests they can write user\",\"269\":\"stories so extrapolate that out as far\",\"272\":\"as possible you have an llm that can do\",\"274\":\"all of these things one at a time what\",\"276\":\"if you stack them all together so\",\"278\":\"another way to think about it a simpler\",\"281\":\"way to think about it is generative AI\",\"284\":\"or llms or whatever they're just a type\",\"286\":\"of automation so if you're an\",\"288\":\"infrastructure engineer an I.T guy or a\",\"290\":\"software Dev or a software architecture\",\"292\":\"software architect just think about\",\"294\":\"generative AI as just another kind of\",\"296\":\"automation that's it automation\",\"299\":\"automation automation that's all you\",\"301\":\"need to think about it is it gives you\",\"303\":\"some new capabilities in the automation\",\"306\":\"name of the game but it's still just\",\"309\":\"fundamentally a kind of automation it's\",\"311\":\"that simple\",\"313\":\"okay so when we talk about this\",\"315\":\"automation engine or this reasoning\",\"317\":\"engine like what things can it automate\",\"319\":\"so first think about how openai just\",\"322\":\"came out with function calling and API\",\"324\":\"use so basically that means that the\",\"328\":\"that your llm your generative AI model\",\"330\":\"is universal middleware it can talk to\",\"333\":\"anything in your organization anything\",\"335\":\"in your Tech stack as long as it's got\",\"337\":\"an API\",\"338\":\"so because of that it can touch\",\"339\":\"everything\",\"341\":\"it's capable of problem solving there\",\"343\":\"are many times where you just plug in\",\"345\":\"like an error code or you know describe\",\"348\":\"something that you're that you're\",\"350\":\"getting and it can understand it it's\",\"352\":\"not always right but it can also\",\"354\":\"understand when it's getting it wrong\",\"356\":\"and kind of stop and you know you can\",\"358\":\"use tree of thought or Chain of Thought\",\"359\":\"or whatever there's all kinds of problem\",\"361\":\"solving uh techniques out there tree of\",\"364\":\"thought by the way increases problem\",\"366\":\"solving capabilities by like 900 or\",\"369\":\"uh so if it can solve problems that\",\"372\":\"means it can overcome problems\",\"373\":\"automatically decision making so here's\",\"376\":\"the thing is with with a given objective\",\"378\":\"or a mission it can make decisions in\",\"381\":\"pursuit of that mission and this is why\",\"384\":\"I say Mission uh oriented uh programming\",\"387\":\"and so then of course planning and\",\"389\":\"brainstorming which is also required for\",\"391\":\"to pursue a any given Mission so if you\",\"395\":\"have an automation engine that is\",\"396\":\"capable of these things now what can you\",\"399\":\"do with this now that it's in your\",\"400\":\"toolbox\",\"402\":\"so one of the first things that you need\",\"404\":\"to think about and to kind of change\",\"407\":\"your mind is on-demand tools or tools\",\"409\":\"that make tools a tool Factory because\",\"411\":\"that's what that I mean that's what GPT\",\"414\":\"does with code it generates new code and\",\"417\":\"what is code but it's a software tool\",\"419\":\"and so you know you think about it like\",\"422\":\"the replicator from Star Trek computer I\",\"424\":\"need something that does X Y and Z and\",\"426\":\"you know a few seconds later it pops out\",\"428\":\"so if you think about the first step\",\"431\":\"towards building polymorphic\",\"433\":\"applications uh the first step towards\",\"435\":\"Mission oriented programming is the\",\"437\":\"ability to synthesize any code object\",\"440\":\"that you need on the Fly and so if it\",\"443\":\"can write code it can test code it can\",\"445\":\"call apis it can read the manual I can\",\"448\":\"write user stories it can read epics it\",\"450\":\"can do all of that stuff you combine all\",\"452\":\"that together and you create an\",\"454\":\"automated tool Factory or a replicator\",\"456\":\"this is the first step in creating\",\"458\":\"polymorphic applications because you can\",\"461\":\"you can stack the blocks together\",\"463\":\"but you need something to make to print\",\"465\":\"the blocks for you right it's like a 3D\",\"466\":\"printer or a replicator but for code and\",\"470\":\"so then once all the blocks are you know\",\"472\":\"you've got a block Factory a tool\",\"474\":\"Factory now you can just plug them all\",\"476\":\"together you may you aim for Plug and\",\"478\":\"Play architecture plugable architecture\",\"480\":\"and from there you know because it's got\",\"483\":\"access to literally every API in your\",\"485\":\"organization it can talk to Azure AWS\",\"487\":\"Google Cloud\",\"489\":\"VMware Microsoft whatever it can talk to\",\"492\":\"everything in your organization as long\",\"494\":\"as it's got an API then you build those\",\"497\":\"building blocks and then you stack them\",\"499\":\"together and what can you do with Legos\",\"501\":\"you can do anything with Legos as long\",\"504\":\"as you've got enough blocks so I think\",\"506\":\"you're kind of getting the picture is\",\"508\":\"that if you think about it in terms of\",\"509\":\"modularity or individual pieces that can\",\"511\":\"be kind of printed or fabricated on\",\"514\":\"demand and then you plug them together\",\"516\":\"that is the underpinning\",\"518\":\"mentality of polymorphic applications\",\"521\":\"it's polymorphic because it can change\",\"523\":\"shapes because all the all the\",\"525\":\"pieces all the underlying pieces are\",\"527\":\"just plug and play\",\"528\":\"okay so we talked about Mission earlier\",\"531\":\"but who runs the show you've got a whole\",\"534\":\"bunch of blocks a whole bunch of\",\"535\":\"building blocks but how do you how does\",\"537\":\"the machine know what to plug into what\",\"539\":\"and and that sort of thing you need a\",\"541\":\"brain right you've got the tool Factory\",\"543\":\"okay great uh and at first it's going to\",\"546\":\"be humans asking for tools you know\",\"548\":\"replicator you know you know tea Earl\",\"550\":\"Gray hot right but\",\"552\":\"what you need to do is ultimately\",\"554\":\"automate as much of that as possible so\",\"557\":\"the tool Factory is automated but then\",\"558\":\"you need to automate the thing that's\",\"560\":\"asking for the tools and the tool and\",\"561\":\"the and the building blocks this is\",\"564\":\"called a cognitive architecture\",\"566\":\"so remember going back to Sachin\",\"567\":\"nadella's point that we have a reasoning\",\"569\":\"engine or a cognitive engine or an\",\"571\":\"automation engine whatever you want to\",\"572\":\"call it it's all the same thing\",\"574\":\"cognition reasoning automation all the\",\"577\":\"same thing now let's dive into cognitive\",\"579\":\"architecture\",\"580\":\"so many of you that have been following\",\"582\":\"my channel for a long time know that I\",\"584\":\"am like the cognitive architecture guy I\",\"586\":\"wrote natural language cognitive\",\"587\":\"architecture more than two years ago now\",\"589\":\"this is my shtix This Is My Jam now what\",\"593\":\"was missing from my books in the past\",\"594\":\"was a more coherent framework I had some\",\"597\":\"diagrams I had some architectural\",\"599\":\"recommendations and a lot of people get\",\"601\":\"a lot out of it but this is like the OSI\",\"604\":\"model but for next-gen applications for\",\"607\":\"polymorphic application so I call it the\",\"609\":\"ace model autonomous cognitive entities\",\"612\":\"so again right there in the name\",\"614\":\"autonomous the idea is to create\",\"616\":\"something that has a higher degree of\",\"618\":\"autonomy but it also uses cognition it\",\"621\":\"uses reasoning and then it's an entity\",\"623\":\"in that it is somewhat self-contained\",\"626\":\"now some people are going to be\",\"627\":\"deploying a generative AI in a more\",\"630\":\"distributed sense and that's not what\",\"631\":\"this video is about this video is about\",\"633\":\"basically the architecture to create\",\"635\":\"commander data or you know bd1 or\",\"638\":\"whatever right if you want to create\",\"639\":\"C-3PO or R2D2 this is the architecture\",\"643\":\"uh the the Paradigm the framework the\",\"646\":\"conceptual framework that you need to\",\"648\":\"implement so without further Ado it is\",\"650\":\"six layers that might change but um I've\",\"653\":\"been working on this for a while so I'm\",\"655\":\"pretty sure I've got it nailed down so\",\"657\":\"the first layer is the aspirational\",\"659\":\"layer this is the layer that is\",\"661\":\"concerned with the mission the values\",\"662\":\"the purpose the ethics and the morals of\",\"666\":\"whatever it is that you're building and\",\"668\":\"like I said we'll get in we'll I'll give\",\"670\":\"you some examples of missions in just a\",\"672\":\"minute so that it'll make more sense\",\"674\":\"the layer 2 is the global strategy layer\",\"676\":\"this is long-term thinking context\",\"678\":\"context is the primary thing for Layer\",\"680\":\"Two and it's basically like a CEO it\",\"682\":\"says okay here's you know I have I have\",\"685\":\"my vision I have my morals right my my\",\"687\":\"higher order beliefs\",\"689\":\"now what is the biggest time Horizon way\",\"693\":\"to think about that mission\",\"696\":\"layer 3 is Agent model so this is the\",\"698\":\"self model and it's primarily concerned\",\"700\":\"with capabilities the machine has to\",\"703\":\"know what it is how it works and what\",\"704\":\"it's capable of in order to make\",\"706\":\"decisions because if you tell a machine\",\"708\":\"hey go solve world hunger it's like okay\",\"710\":\"cool well I'm gonna go plant a bunch of\",\"712\":\"fields it's like well actually you've\",\"714\":\"only got a budget of fifty dollars right\",\"715\":\"and and you've got one hand then and\",\"717\":\"it's tied behind your back right so by\",\"720\":\"understanding what the model is capable\",\"722\":\"of or your engine or your architecture\",\"724\":\"it has to know what it is capable of and\",\"726\":\"what it's not capable of\",\"729\":\"it also has to be capable of changing\",\"731\":\"itself so this is where the the\",\"732\":\"polymorphic thing comes in if it\",\"734\":\"understands that it has a limitation\",\"736\":\"such as like well I don't have access to\",\"738\":\"that API I need to get access to that\",\"740\":\"API\",\"741\":\"um how do I get access to that do I send\",\"743\":\"a ticket to the help desk and they'll\",\"745\":\"give me permission or is it something\",\"747\":\"that I can solve on my own that sort of\",\"749\":\"thing so you need a very comprehensive\",\"751\":\"agent model in order for the machine to\",\"754\":\"be able to change itself\",\"756\":\"um in in alignment with pursuing its\",\"759\":\"Mission and so you're probably got some\",\"761\":\"alarm Bells\",\"762\":\"pinging because you're like Dave you're\",\"765\":\"basically designing Skynet which is\",\"766\":\"exactly why the aspirational layer is at\",\"769\":\"the very top those those constraints\",\"771\":\"those boundaries the missions the values\",\"774\":\"the purpose this is around this is what\",\"776\":\"it what you know sets the tone The\",\"778\":\"Guiding North Star of the device so that\",\"782\":\"it never fully goes off the rails but\",\"784\":\"you need something that is constantly\",\"786\":\"watching you know it's it's the ideal\",\"788\":\"self and we'll dive into each of these\",\"789\":\"layers in just a minute but I wanted to\",\"790\":\"give you the whole framework at a high\",\"793\":\"level overview So Below the agent model\",\"795\":\"is the executive function so this is\",\"798\":\"primarily concerned with planning or\",\"799\":\"making plans so that means like\",\"802\":\"forecasting like okay what's going to go\",\"803\":\"wrong how do I think through this\",\"805\":\"directives oh and you know the The\",\"807\":\"Prompt engineering is already there\",\"809\":\"let's think through this step by step\",\"810\":\"right take that out to the nth degree\",\"812\":\"that's the executive function layer this\",\"815\":\"is also concerned with resources\",\"817\":\"so if you make a plan you have to know\",\"819\":\"what resources are available to you and\",\"821\":\"these are external resources right the\",\"823\":\"agent model in terms of capabilities\",\"825\":\"that is internal resources this is what\",\"827\":\"I am capable of in the world but then\",\"830\":\"executive function for planning is about\",\"832\":\"external resources how much compute do I\",\"835\":\"need what kind of developers need to\",\"837\":\"help me\",\"838\":\"um what kind of access do I need what\",\"839\":\"kind of data do I need from the outside\",\"841\":\"world and so then once you get a plan\",\"843\":\"together you get the blueprint you get\",\"845\":\"the the burn down chart or however you\",\"847\":\"want to organize it your kanban board\",\"849\":\"your jira board right because that's\",\"851\":\"basically what you're interacting with\",\"853\":\"here at the executive function layer\",\"855\":\"below that is cognitive control\",\"857\":\"cognitive control is saying okay here's\",\"859\":\"the big plan now what so this is about a\",\"863\":\"task selection and task switching so\",\"866\":\"that means choosing the correct order of\",\"868\":\"operations and then but more importantly\",\"871\":\"choosing when to switch tasks because if\",\"874\":\"something isn't working or you or you\",\"875\":\"started a task and then it's not the\",\"877\":\"right order of operations or you realize\",\"879\":\"that you've come into a barrier you need\",\"881\":\"to back out of that task and choose a\",\"883\":\"different one and so that is driven by\",\"886\":\"frustration signals and cognitive\",\"888\":\"damping which we'll get into in just a\",\"889\":\"moment and then finally layer six is\",\"892\":\"Task prosecution which is doing one task\",\"894\":\"at a time but more importantly detecting\",\"897\":\"when that task is is truly successful or\",\"900\":\"has failed and then reporting that\",\"902\":\"information back up to the cognitive\",\"903\":\"control layer which will then adjust the\",\"906\":\"frustration and damping signals okay so\",\"908\":\"let's get into these layers a little bit\",\"910\":\"deeper number one the aspirational layer\",\"913\":\"it's all about Mission I'll just read\",\"914\":\"the description to you this is the\",\"917\":\"uppermost layer which is somewhat\",\"918\":\"abstracted and detached this is the\",\"920\":\"ideal cell for superego version of the\",\"923\":\"agent which keeps track of the highest\",\"925\":\"values virtues principles vision and\",\"927\":\"mission of the agent in other words this\",\"929\":\"sets the tone for all other layers below\",\"931\":\"it in other words sorry I meant that I\",\"934\":\"didn't use that twice this serves as the\",\"936\":\"moral compass and The Guiding North Star\",\"937\":\"for the autonomous cognitive entity for\",\"939\":\"the ace it provides the raise and Detra\",\"942\":\"and I'm no I didn't say that right but\",\"944\":\"the reason for being it is this layer\",\"946\":\"also serves as the ultimate orbital\",\"948\":\"Arbiter for all moral dilemmas\",\"950\":\"that that thing faces and so what I mean\",\"953\":\"by that is here's some examples of\",\"955\":\"submissions that you might give so for\",\"958\":\"lawyers\",\"959\":\"um this is this is set by uh the ethical\",\"961\":\"standards and and uh regulations and\",\"964\":\"whatever uh but the the mission of a\",\"966\":\"lawyer is to zealously advocate for\",\"968\":\"their client that is the highest mission\",\"970\":\"of a lawyer for doctors achieve the best\",\"973\":\"possible Health outcome for their\",\"975\":\"patient so these are these are examples\",\"977\":\"of aspirational missions that\",\"979\":\"um that that Central Mission informs\",\"981\":\"every decision that they make including\",\"984\":\"all moral decisions all ethical\",\"986\":\"decisions uh it it also speaks to how\",\"989\":\"they allocate their time energy and\",\"991\":\"resources and so by having a centrally\",\"993\":\"organizing

will pursue that mission\",\"1005\":\"uh and then any decisions that it makes\",\"1007\":\"will be uh with respect to and in\",\"1010\":\"pursuit of in honor of that mission and\",\"1014\":\"that's

                            "Of course! The YouTube Video Summarizer is a tool that fetches transcriptions from a YouTube video and then provides a concise text summary of the content. Here's a breakdown of its features:\n\n1. **Transcriptions**: It can retrieve transcriptions from YouTube videos, which are the spoken words in the video converted to text.\n\n2. **Multilingual Support**: The tool can handle videos in various languages including English, Spanish, Chinese, Hindi, French, Portuguese, Bengali, Russian, Japanese, and Punjabi.\n\n3. **Handling Long Transcriptions**: If a video has a lengthy transcription, the tool can split it into multiple pages. If this happens, you'll be informed of the additional pages, and you can choose to retrieve more details from subsequent pages if you wish.\n\n4. **Timestamp Links**: The summaries provided include video timestamps. This means you can access specific parts of the video directly from the summary. For instance, a link like `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMgWiOPJ9J4&t=1454s` will take you to the video at the 24-minute and 14-second mark.\n\n5. **Essential Video Details**: Every summary response will include essential details about the video, such as its URL, number of views, length, and channel information.\n\n6. **URL Compatibility**: In some cases, the tool might not recognize certain YouTube URLs due to their format. If this happens, you can adjust the URL to a more standard format, and the tool should recognize it.\n\n7. **Summarization Style**: By default, the tool provides a bullet-point summary with timestamp links. However, you can specify a different style if you prefer.\n\nIt's a handy tool if you want a quick overview of a YouTube video without watching the entire thing! Would you like to try it out or learn more about anything specific?"

PARADIGMS\",\"description\":null,\"transcribed_part\":{\"0\":\"good morning everybody David Shapiro\",\"2\":\"here with another video\",\"4\":\"so uh I mentioned a few videos ago you\",\"7\":\"may or may not have seen it I mentioned\",\"8\":\"the concept of polymorphic applications\",\"11\":\"and a bunch of you are like what is this\",\"13\":\"concept tell me more and some people are\",\"15\":\"like yeah whatever that's not possible\",\"17\":\"so\",\"18\":\"this video is here to teach you a new\",\"22\":\"paradigm of software development and\",\"25\":\"software architecture so it's I call it\",\"28\":\"polymorphic applications or basically\",\"29\":\"self-changing applications\",\"32\":\"and we'll get right into it but first I\",\"36\":\"just wanted to say I am available I used\",\"39\":\"to do Consulting on patreon I still have\",\"41\":\"a few patreon clients there but I'm kind\",\"43\":\"of moving uh moving to more involved\",\"46\":\"engagements including strategic and\",\"49\":\"Technical Consulting teaching and\",\"51\":\"coaching as well as speaking engagements\",\"54\":\"so reach out to me on LinkedIn if you're\",\"56\":\"interested in any of these services and\",\"60\":\"then with all that back to the show\",\"62\":\"so a couple days ago uh Microsoft CEO\",\"66\":\"Satya Nadella at the Microsoft Inspire\",\"69\":\"2023 uh keynote basically said AI is\",\"74\":\"here and these are the new capabilities\",\"76\":\"because of language technology so the\",\"79\":\"two primary components that he outlined\",\"81\":\"were natural language interface so\",\"84\":\"that's the front end right voice chat\",\"86\":\"that sort of thing emails and then in\",\"89\":\"the back end you have what's called a\",\"91\":\"reasoning engine\",\"92\":\"and so what is a reasoning engine in\",\"95\":\"this case a reasoning engine is instead\",\"98\":\"of thinking about the language models as\",\"100\":\"something that just generates text right\",\"102\":\"A lot of people pick the low hanging\",\"104\":\"fruit let's use it to write emails let's\",\"106\":\"use it to write fiction uh you know\",\"108\":\"that's that's the obvious use case but\",\"110\":\"what's less obvious and this is what I\",\"112\":\"have been advocating for for literally\",\"113\":\"years uh when I wrote my initial book on\",\"116\":\"cognitive architecture natural language\",\"118\":\"cognitive architecture I said we have\",\"120\":\"invented a cognitive engine or a\",\"122\":\"reasoning engine he probably didn't use\",\"124\":\"cognitive engine because that's a very\",\"125\":\"anthropomorphic but it's a it's a\",\"128\":\"reasoning engine and so what does that\",\"129\":\"mean\",\"130\":\"language models uh are they're capable\",\"133\":\"of brainstorming and planning they're\",\"135\":\"capable of problem solving they're\",\"136\":\"capable of coding and testing code and\",\"138\":\"interpreting bugs they're also capable\",\"141\":\"of choosing and deciding or making\",\"143\":\"decisions and so these are all elements\",\"146\":\"of cognition and this is why I have been\",\"149\":\"focusing on cognitive architecture for\",\"151\":\"the last four years\",\"153\":\"so also the keynote was really good you\",\"155\":\"should watch it if you haven't\",\"156\":\"especially if you're if you're whether\",\"158\":\"you're an investor in this space or a\",\"161\":\"startup founder or a product owner if\",\"164\":\"you are doing anything with generative\",\"166\":\"AI you need to watch that keynote speech\",\"170\":\"Okay so\",\"172\":\"I promised polymorphic applications but\",\"175\":\"really one thing that you need to become\",\"177\":\"more familiar with is what I call\",\"178\":\"Mission oriented programming so this is\",\"181\":\"the next Paradigm Beyond object oriented\",\"184\":\"programming instead we instead of\",\"186\":\"thinking of objects we now have to think\",\"188\":\"of missions uh as the as the primary\",\"191\":\"organizing feature of this new software\",\"193\":\"Paradigm and so let me just read the\",\"196\":\"definition a mission oriented\",\"198\":\"programming is a paradigm in software\",\"199\":\"development where applications are\",\"201\":\"primarily designed and built around a\",\"203\":\"clear measurable and purposeful Mission\",\"205\":\"and I'll give you some examples in a\",\"207\":\"little bit don't panic\",\"208\":\"the mission serves as the core driver of\",\"211\":\"the software's behavior adaptation and\",\"213\":\"evolution these applications often\",\"215\":\"referred to as polymorphic applications\",\"216\":\"are not just tools but active agents in\",\"219\":\"pursuing their respective Mission and so\",\"221\":\"then there's a few components of this\",\"222\":\"one mission-centric design number two\",\"226\":\"autonomy and agency the ability to make\",\"228\":\"decisions uh in pursuit of that mission\",\"231\":\"uh there's needs to be adaptability and\",\"234\":\"flexibility hence the polymorphic aspect\",\"236\":\"Dynamic tool creation if it needs a tool\",\"239\":\"it can make the tool and then on the\",\"242\":\"lower level uh how do you actually allow\",\"245\":\"the the the application to change itself\",\"247\":\"you use micro Frameworks configurable\",\"250\":\"front ends and configurable back-ends uh\",\"253\":\"okay cool so I just threw a lot at you\",\"255\":\"um you're probably like what what are\",\"257\":\"you talking about uh you know\",\"261\":\"think about it this way this is how we\",\"262\":\"got here\",\"263\":\"llms can write code they can solve\",\"266\":\"problems they can make decisions they\",\"267\":\"can write unit tests they can write user\",\"269\":\"stories so extrapolate that out as far\",\"272\":\"as possible you have an llm that can do\",\"274\":\"all of these things one at a time what\",\"276\":\"if you stack them all together so\",\"278\":\"another way to think about it a simpler\",\"281\":\"way to think about it is generative AI\",\"284\":\"or llms or whatever they're just a type\",\"286\":\"of automation so if you're an\",\"288\":\"infrastructure engineer an I.T guy or a\",\"290\":\"software Dev or a software architecture\",\"292\":\"software architect just think about\",\"294\":\"generative AI as just another kind of\",\"296\":\"automation that's it automation\",\"299\":\"automation automation that's all you\",\"301\":\"need to think about it is it gives you\",\"303\":\"some new capabilities in the automation\",\"306\":\"name of the game but it's still just\",\"309\":\"fundamentally a kind of automation it's\",\"311\":\"that simple\",\"313\":\"okay so when we talk about this\",\"315\":\"automation engine or this reasoning\",\"317\":\"engine like what things can it automate\",\"319\":\"so first think about how openai just\",\"322\":\"came out with function calling and API\",\"324\":\"use so basically that means that the\",\"328\":\"that your llm your generative AI model\",\"330\":\"is universal middleware it can talk to\",\"333\":\"anything in your organization anything\",\"335\":\"in your Tech stack as long as it's got\",\"337\":\"an API\",\"338\":\"so because of that it can touch\",\"339\":\"everything\",\"341\":\"it's capable of problem solving there\",\"343\":\"are many times where you just plug in\",\"345\":\"like an error code or you know describe\",\"348\":\"something that you're that you're\",\"350\":\"getting and it can understand it it's\",\"352\":\"not always right but it can also\",\"354\":\"understand when it's getting it wrong\",\"356\":\"and kind of stop and you know you can\",\"358\":\"use tree of thought or Chain of Thought\",\"359\":\"or whatever there's all kinds of problem\",\"361\":\"solving uh techniques out there tree of\",\"364\":\"thought by the way increases problem\",\"366\":\"solving capabilities by like 900 or\",\"369\":\"uh so if it can solve problems that\",\"372\":\"means it can overcome problems\",\"373\":\"automatically decision making so here's\",\"376\":\"the thing is with with a given objective\",\"378\":\"or a mission it can make decisions in\",\"381\":\"pursuit of that mission and this is why\",\"384\":\"I say Mission uh oriented uh programming\",\"387\":\"and so then of course planning and\",\"389\":\"brainstorming which is also required for\",\"391\":\"to pursue a any given Mission so if you\",\"395\":\"have an automation engine that is\",\"396\":\"capable of these things now what can you\",\"399\":\"do with this now that it's in your\",\"400\":\"toolbox\",\"402\":\"so one of the first things that you need\",\"404\":\"to think about and to kind of change\",\"407\":\"your mind is on-demand tools or tools\",\"409\":\"that make tools a tool Factory because\",\"411\":\"that's what that I mean that's what GPT\",\"414\":\"does with code it generates new code and\",\"417\":\"what is code but it's a software tool\",\"419\":\"and so you know you think about it like\",\"422\":\"the replicator from Star Trek computer I\",\"424\":\"need something that does X Y and Z and\",\"426\":\"you know a few seconds later it pops out\",\"428\":\"so if you think about the first step\",\"431\":\"towards building polymorphic\",\"433\":\"applications uh the first step towards\",\"435\":\"Mission oriented programming is the\",\"437\":\"ability to synthesize any code object\",\"440\":\"that you need on the Fly and so if it\",\"443\":\"can write code it can test code it can\",\"445\":\"call apis it can read the manual I can\",\"448\":\"write user stories it can read epics it\",\"450\":\"can do all of that stuff you combine all\",\"452\":\"that together and you create an\",\"454\":\"automated tool Factory or a replicator\",\"456\":\"this is the first step in creating\",\"458\":\"polymorphic applications because you can\",\"461\":\"you can stack the blocks together\",\"463\":\"but you need something to make to print\",\"465\":\"the blocks for you right it's like a 3D\",\"466\":\"printer or a replicator but for code and\",\"470\":\"so then once all the blocks are you know\",\"472\":\"you've got a block Factory a tool\",\"474\":\"Factory now you can just plug them all\",\"476\":\"together you may you aim for Plug and\",\"478\":\"Play architecture plugable architecture\",\"480\":\"and from there you know because it's got\",\"483\":\"access to literally every API in your\",\"485\":\"organization it can talk to Azure AWS\",\"487\":\"Google Cloud\",\"489\":\"VMware Microsoft whatever it can talk to\",\"492\":\"everything in your organization as long\",\"494\":\"as it's got an API then you build those\",\"497\":\"building blocks and then you stack them\",\"499\":\"together and what can you do with Legos\",\"501\":\"you can do anything with Legos as long\",\"504\":\"as you've got enough blocks so I think\",\"506\":\"you're kind of getting the picture is\",\"508\":\"that if you think about it in terms of\",\"509\":\"modularity or individual pieces that can\",\"511\":\"be kind of printed or fabricated on\",\"514\":\"demand and then you plug them together\",\"516\":\"that is the underpinning\",\"518\":\"mentality of polymorphic applications\",\"521\":\"it's polymorphic because it can change\",\"523\":\"shapes because all the all the\",\"525\":\"pieces all the underlying pieces are\",\"527\":\"just plug and play\",\"528\":\"okay so we talked about Mission earlier\",\"531\":\"but who runs the show you've got a whole\",\"534\":\"bunch of blocks a whole bunch of\",\"535\":\"building blocks but how do you how does\",\"537\":\"the machine know what to plug into what\",\"539\":\"and and that sort of thing you need a\",\"541\":\"brain right you've got the tool Factory\",\"543\":\"okay great uh and at first it's going to\",\"546\":\"be humans asking for tools you know\",\"548\":\"replicator you know you know tea Earl\",\"550\":\"Gray hot right but\",\"552\":\"what you need to do is ultimately\",\"554\":\"automate as much of that as possible so\",\"557\":\"the tool Factory is automated but then\",\"558\":\"you need to automate the thing that's\",\"560\":\"asking for the tools and the tool and\",\"561\":\"the and the building blocks this is\",\"564\":\"called a cognitive architecture\",\"566\":\"so remember going back to Sachin\",\"567\":\"nadella's point that we have a reasoning\",\"569\":\"engine or a cognitive engine or an\",\"571\":\"automation engine whatever you want to\",\"572\":\"call it it's all the same thing\",\"574\":\"cognition reasoning automation all the\",\"577\":\"same thing now let's dive into cognitive\",\"579\":\"architecture\",\"580\":\"so many of you that have been following\",\"582\":\"my channel for a long time know that I\",\"584\":\"am like the cognitive architecture guy I\",\"586\":\"wrote natural language cognitive\",\"587\":\"architecture more than two years ago now\",\"589\":\"this is my shtix This Is My Jam now what\",\"593\":\"was missing from my books in the past\",\"594\":\"was a more coherent framework I had some\",\"597\":\"diagrams I had some architectural\",\"599\":\"recommendations and a lot of people get\",\"601\":\"a lot out of it but this is like the OSI\",\"604\":\"model but for next-gen applications for\",\"607\":\"polymorphic application so I call it the\",\"609\":\"ace model autonomous cognitive entities\",\"612\":\"so again right there in the name\",\"614\":\"autonomous the idea is to create\",\"616\":\"something that has a higher degree of\",\"618\":\"autonomy but it also uses cognition it\",\"621\":\"uses reasoning and then it's an entity\",\"623\":\"in that it is somewhat self-contained\",\"626\":\"now some people are going to be\",\"627\":\"deploying a generative AI in a more\",\"630\":\"distributed sense and that's not what\",\"631\":\"this video is about this video is about\",\"633\":\"basically the architecture to create\",\"635\":\"commander data or you know bd1 or\",\"638\":\"whatever right if you want to create\",\"639\":\"C-3PO or R2D2 this is the architecture\",\"643\":\"uh the the Paradigm the framework the\",\"646\":\"conceptual framework that you need to\",\"648\":\"implement so without further Ado it is\",\"650\":\"six layers that might change but um I've\",\"653\":\"been working on this for a while so I'm\",\"655\":\"pretty sure I've got it nailed down so\",\"657\":\"the first layer is the aspirational\",\"659\":\"layer this is the layer that is\",\"661\":\"concerned with the mission the values\",\"662\":\"the purpose the ethics and the morals of\",\"666\":\"whatever it is that you're building and\",\"668\":\"like I said we'll get in we'll I'll give\",\"670\":\"you some examples of missions in just a\",\"672\":\"minute so that it'll make more sense\",\"674\":\"the layer 2 is the global strategy layer\",\"676\":\"this is long-term thinking context\",\"678\":\"context is the primary thing for Layer\",\"680\":\"Two and it's basically like a CEO it\",\"682\":\"says okay here's you know I have I have\",\"685\":\"my vision I have my morals right my my\",\"687\":\"higher order beliefs\",\"689\":\"now what is the biggest time Horizon way\",\"693\":\"to think about that mission\",\"696\":\"layer 3 is Agent model so this is the\",\"698\":\"self model and it's primarily concerned\",\"700\":\"with capabilities the machine has to\",\"703\":\"know what it is how it works and what\",\"704\":\"it's capable of in order to make\",\"706\":\"decisions because if you tell a machine\",\"708\":\"hey go solve world hunger it's like okay\",\"710\":\"cool well I'm gonna go plant a bunch of\",\"712\":\"fields it's like well actually you've\",\"714\":\"only got a budget of fifty dollars right\",\"715\":\"and and you've got one hand then and\",\"717\":\"it's tied behind your back right so by\",\"720\":\"understanding what the model is capable\",\"722\":\"of or your engine or your architecture\",\"724\":\"it has to know what it is capable of and\",\"726\":\"what it's not capable of\",\"729\":\"it also has to be capable of changing\",\"731\":\"itself so this is where the the\",\"732\":\"polymorphic thing comes in if it\",\"734\":\"understands that it has a limitation\",\"736\":\"such as like well I don't have access to\",\"738\":\"that API I need to get access to that\",\"740\":\"API\",\"741\":\"um how do I get access to that do I send\",\"743\":\"a ticket to the help desk and they'll\",\"745\":\"give me permission or is it something\",\"747\":\"that I can solve on my own that sort of\",\"749\":\"thing so you need a very comprehensive\",\"751\":\"agent model in order for the machine to\",\"754\":\"be able to change itself\",\"756\":\"um in in alignment with pursuing its\",\"759\":\"Mission and so you're probably got some\",\"761\":\"alarm Bells\",\"762\":\"pinging because you're like Dave you're\",\"765\":\"basically designing Skynet which is\",\"766\":\"exactly why the aspirational layer is at\",\"769\":\"the very top those those constraints\",\"771\":\"those boundaries the missions the values\",\"774\":\"the purpose this is around this is what\",\"776\":\"it what you know sets the tone The\",\"778\":\"Guiding North Star of the device so that\",\"782\":\"it never fully goes off the rails but\",\"784\":\"you need something that is constantly\",\"786\":\"watching you know it's it's the ideal\",\"788\":\"self and we'll dive into each of these\",\"789\":\"layers in just a minute but I wanted to\",\"790\":\"give you the whole framework at a high\",\"793\":\"level overview So Below the agent model\",\"795\":\"is the executive function so this is\",\"798\":\"primarily concerned with planning or\",\"799\":\"making plans so that means like\",\"802\":\"forecasting like okay what's going to go\",\"803\":\"wrong how do I think through this\",\"805\":\"directives oh and you know the The\",\"807\":\"Prompt engineering is already there\",\"809\":\"let's think through this step by step\",\"810\":\"right take that out to the nth degree\",\"812\":\"that's the executive function layer this\",\"815\":\"is also concerned with resources\",\"817\":\"so if you make a plan you have to know\",\"819\":\"what resources are available to you and\",\"821\":\"these are external resources right the\",\"823\":\"agent model in terms of capabilities\",\"825\":\"that is internal resources this is what\",\"827\":\"I am capable of in the world but then\",\"830\":\"executive function for planning is about\",\"832\":\"external resources how much compute do I\",\"835\":\"need what kind of developers need to\",\"837\":\"help me\",\"838\":\"um what kind of access do I need what\",\"839\":\"kind of data do I need from the outside\",\"841\":\"world and so then once you get a plan\",\"843\":\"together you get the blueprint you get\",\"845\":\"the the burn down chart or however you\",\"847\":\"want to organize it your kanban board\",\"849\":\"your jira board right because that's\",\"851\":\"basically what you're interacting with\",\"853\":\"here at the executive function layer\",\"855\":\"below that is cognitive control\",\"857\":\"cognitive control is saying okay here's\",\"859\":\"the big plan now what so this is about a\",\"863\":\"task selection and task switching so\",\"866\":\"that means choosing the correct order of\",\"868\":\"operations and then but more importantly\",\"871\":\"choosing when to switch tasks because if\",\"874\":\"something isn't working or you or you\",\"875\":\"started a task and then it's not the\",\"877\":\"right order of operations or you realize\",\"879\":\"that you've come into a barrier you need\",\"881\":\"to back out of that task and choose a\",\"883\":\"different one and so that is driven by\",\"886\":\"frustration signals and cognitive\",\"888\":\"damping which we'll get into in just a\",\"889\":\"moment and then finally layer six is\",\"892\":\"Task prosecution which is doing one task\",\"894\":\"at a time but more importantly detecting\",\"897\":\"when that task is is truly successful or\",\"900\":\"has

so\",\"908\":\"let's get into these layers a little bit\",\"910\":\"deeper number one the aspirational layer\",\"913\":\"it's all about Mission I'll just read\",\"914\":\"the description to you this is the\",\"917\":\"uppermost layer which is somewhat\",\"918\":\"abstracted and detached this is the\",\"920\":\"ideal cell for superego version of the\",\"923\":\"agent which keeps track of the

meant that I\",\"934\":\"didn't use that twice this serves as the\",\"936\":\"moral compass and The Guiding North Star\",\"937\":\"for the autonomous cognitive entity for\",\"939\":\"the ace it provides the raise and Detra\",\"942\":\"and I'm no I didn't say that right but\",\"944\":\"the reason for being it is this layer\",\"946\":\"also serves as the ultimate orbital\",\"948\":\"Arbiter for all moral dilemmas\",\"950\":\"that that thing faces and so what I mean\",\"953\":\"by that is here's some examples of\",\"955\":\"submissions that you might give so for\",\"958\":\"lawyers\",\"959\":\"um this is this is set by uh the ethical\",\"961\":\"standards and and uh regulations and\",\"964\":\"whatever uh but the the mission of a\",\"966\":\"lawyer is to zealously advocate for\",\"968\":\"their client that is the highest mission\",\"970\":\"of a lawyer for doctors achieve the best\",\"973\":\"possible Health outcome for their\",\"975\":\"patient so these are these are examples\",\"977\":\"of aspirational missions that\",\"979\":\"um that that Central Mission informs\",\"981\":\"every decision that they make including\",\"984\":\"all moral

                            "Certainly! Here's a summary of the video titled \"Polymorphic Applications: Mission-Driven Software, Cognitive Architectures, NEXT-GEN PARADIGMS\" by David Shapiro ~ AI:\n\n- **Introduction**:\n  - David Shapiro introduces the concept of polymorphic applications.\n  - He mentions that some viewers had previously shown interest in this topic.\n  - David highlights his availability for consulting, teaching, coaching, and speaking engagements. [Link to video segment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1gBosXlM8c&t=36s)\n\n- **Concept of Polymorphic Applications**:\n  - Polymorphic applications are self-changing software.\n  - David refers to a recent keynote by Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, emphasizing the importance of AI and its capabilities, particularly in natural language interfaces and reasoning engines. [Link to video segment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1gBosXlM8c&t=62s)\n  - Reasoning engines are not just about generating text but also about brainstorming, planning, problem-solving, coding, and decision-making. [Link to video segment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1gBosXlM8c&t=130s)\n\n- **Mission-Oriented Programming**:\n  - David introduces the concept of mission-oriented programming as the next paradigm beyond object-oriented programming.\n  - In this paradigm, software is designed around a clear, measurable, and purposeful mission.\n  - Polymorphic applications are seen as active agents in pursuing their missions. [Link to video segment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1gBosXlM8c&t=208s)\n\n- **Generative AI as Automation**:\n  - Generative AI models, like GPT, are viewed as a type of automation.\n  - These models can write code, solve problems, make decisions, and more.\n  - David emphasizes the importance of modularity and the ability to \"print\" or fabricate code on demand. [Link to video segment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1gBosXlM8c&t=263s)\n\n- **Cognitive Architecture**:\n  - David delves into the concept of cognitive architecture, which he describes as the framework for creating advanced AI entities.\n  - He introduces the ACE model (Autonomous Cognitive Entities) which consists of six layers: Aspirational, Global Strategy, Agent Model, Executive Function, Cognitive Control, and Task Prosecution. [Link to video segment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1gBosXlM8c&t=580s)\n  - Each layer has its specific function, from setting the mission and values at the topmost layer to executing tasks at the bottommost layer.\n\nThe video is quite detailed and covers a lot of ground on the topic of polymorphic applications and cognitive architectures. This summary provides an overview, but there's more content in the video, especially as it spans multiple pages of transcription. Would you like more details or a continuation of the summary?"

now it's thinking about a century\",\"1108\":\"from now it's also looking at the entire\",\"1110\":\"planet Earth and then if you know we\",\"1112\":\"expand beyond Earth it'll be

start super\",\"1131\":\"high level super detached and then we\",\"1133\":\"zoom in uh progressively with each layer\",\"1136\":\"so this has to do with World State as\",\"1138\":\"well all right I think you get the idea\",\"1140\":\"so let's move on agent model agent model\",\"1143\":\"is all about capabilities this is the\",\"1145\":\"ego of the of the machine it this is\",\"1147\":\"what it

here\",\"1156\":\"we're talking about reasoning engines\",\"1157\":\"this is the layer that confers\",\"1159\":\"functional sentience this is the first\",\"1161\":\"layer where your uh your

other kind of\",\"1179\":\"stuff so this is self-referential\",\"1181\":\"information what is it like basically\",\"1184\":\"the question is what am I capable of how\",\"1186\":\"am I built what can I do what can't I do\",\"1188\":\"what am I allowed to change about myself\",\"1191\":\"what can I change about myself what\",\"1193\":\"functions are autonomics so for instance\",\"1195\":\"if you have a bunch of models that are\",\"1198\":\"just learning on online all the time it\",\"1200\":\"needs to understand that and so that it\",\"1202\":\"could steer those models learning you\",\"1204\":\"probably will use frozen models at first\",\"1206\":\"because you don't want the thing you\",\"1208\":\"know having a complex set of\",\"1209\":\"interactions and learning stuff that you\",\"1211\":\"weren't aware of\",\"1213\":\"but in the long run these things will be\",\"1215\":\"uh basically curating their own internal\",\"1218\":\"architecture their own internal

let's\",\"1274\":\"stick with something a little bit more\",\"1276\":\"constructive\",\"1277\":\"the next layer is executive function so\",\"1280\":\"this is a this is primarily about\",\"1281\":\"planning uh you know whether so once you\",\"1285\":\"have once you have the mission you've\",\"1287\":\"got the vision and you've got the global\",\"1289\":\"context and then you know what you're\",\"1290\":\"capable of with all of that in in mind\",\"1293\":\"you're then able to say okay well you\",\"1296\":\"know I've got access to you know so so\",\"1298\":\"and so internal resources this is what's\",\"1300\":\"going on in the world okay cool now\",\"1302\":\"let's come up with a with a plan to\",\"1304\":\"actually make it happen and so you can\",\"1306\":\"think about this as a little miniature\",\"1308\":\"internal project manager or or a\",\"1310\":\"director right so it's you know CEO and\",\"1313\":\"then you got like director or PM or\",\"1315\":\"program owner or whatever right but it's\",\"1318\":\"fundamentally about like okay let's\",\"1319\":\"think through this whole thing end to\",\"1321\":\"end let's come up with a plan to do this\",\"1323\":\"and remember large language models are\",\"1324\":\"great at it if you don't believe me go\",\"1326\":\"to chat gbt right now and tell it a\",\"1328\":\"problem give it give it everything that\",\"1330\":\"I just in the upper layers and say come\",\"1332\":\"up with a plan and you'll see that it\",\"1333\":\"can do it\",\"1334\":\"okay so once you uh what goes into the\",\"1338\":\"plan though so you you have to think\",\"1339\":\"into the future right okay so you\",\"1341\":\"forecast like what are the choke points\",\"1343\":\"what are the points of failure\",\"1345\":\"um what's going to be happening uh what\",\"1347\":\"resources do I need and so this is\",\"1349\":\"really critical remember I was talking\",\"1350\":\"about external resources what kind of\",\"1352\":\"help am I going to need how many parts\",\"1354\":\"materials money energy whatever data so\",\"1358\":\"this is where this is the layer where\",\"1359\":\"it's like okay let's let's scrape\",\"1361\":\"together a specific project plan for\",\"1364\":\"this exact project whatever it whatever\",\"1366\":\"it's going to come up with in order to\",\"1368\":\"pursue that given mission\",\"1371\":\"below that is cognitive control so\",\"1373\":\"cognitive control is fundamentally about\",\"1374\":\"focus it says okay we've got the plan\",\"1377\":\"we've got the mission I know what I'm\",\"1378\":\"capable of\",\"1379\":\"now what do I do what is the correct\",\"1382\":\"order of operations here so this is Task\",\"1384\":\"selection and task switching and so if\",\"1387\":\"you've got really bad ADHD then your\",\"1390\":\"brain will switch tasks on you uh\",\"1392\":\"without you without your consent\",\"1395\":\"um and so that is that is an executive\",\"1396\":\"dysfunction that happens in humans and\",\"1398\":\"as people have noticed executive\",\"1400\":\"dysfunction is really common in these\",\"1402\":\"language models because they'll just\",\"1403\":\"they'll they'll uh they'll contact\",\"1405\":\"switch without you telling it because\",\"1407\":\"they're they don't they don't have it so\",\"1409\":\"this layer is about giving it that that\",\"1413\":\"cognitive control so that it doesn't\",\"1415\":\"context switch or task switch unless and\",\"1418\":\"until it's ready or it's supposed to so\",\"1421\":\"this layer is uh most going to be most\",\"1424\":\"familiar to people who are familiar with\",\"1426\":\"a term called finite State machines so\",\"1429\":\"basically a finite State machine says\",\"1431\":\"you're doing one of any number of tasks\",\"1433\":\"you're and and so this is really common\",\"1435\":\"in robotics and NPCs and video games you\",\"1439\":\"for an MPC you might be fighting you\",\"1441\":\"might be running you might be hiding you\",\"1443\":\"might be searching so there's a finite\",\"1445\":\"number of states that you can be in or\",\"1447\":\"there's a finite number of tasks you can\",\"1449\":\"pick from from the plant the project\",\"1451\":\"plan above\",\"1453\":\"so what whatever state the machine is in\",\"1456\":\"you have to switch between those States\",\"1458\":\"and say okay right now I'm writing code\",\"1460\":\"then I'm going to switch to testing code\",\"1462\":\"then I'm going to switch to\",\"1465\":\"um doing integration testing then I'm\",\"1466\":\"going to switch to deployment right so\",\"1469\":\"this is that is what cognitive control\",\"1471\":\"is about it is about task switching task\",\"1473\":\"selection and then it's driven in part\",\"1476\":\"by so from above it's driven by the\",\"1479\":\"project plan from below it's driven by\",\"1481\":\"frustration and damping so frustration\",\"1483\":\"is very simple frustration is simply\",\"1485\":\"just keeping track of the rate of\",\"1487\":\"failures versus the rate of successes if\",\"1490\":\"the rate of failures is too high then\",\"1492\":\"you've got the wrong plan and that means\",\"1494\":\"you need to go up a layer and the and\",\"1496\":\"the executive function layer says well\",\"1498\":\"this plan isn't working let's make a new\",\"1500\":\"plan right so that's where frustration\",\"1502\":\"comes in because if if if everything\",\"1504\":\"you're trying and 75 of it is failing\",\"1506\":\"you're probably got the wrong plan so\",\"1508\":\"you need to go up and and kind of\",\"1510\":\"re-strategize and reallocate resources\",\"1512\":\"and fee that information back in I cover\",\"1515\":\"all this in my book um uh Symphony of\",\"1517\":\"thought by the way where I I give plenty\",\"1519\":\"of examples of how to achieve each of\",\"1521\":\"these steps with prompt engineering\",\"1524\":\"uh damping is so cognitive damping is\",\"1528\":\"basically okay let's pump the brakes\",\"1530\":\"let's try and prove ourselves wrong\",\"1532\":\"right like okay let's let's think\",\"1534\":\"through this let's do\",\"1536\":\"um like what could go wrong here uh\",\"1538\":\"let's let's think about uh failure\",\"1540\":\"points let's think about is this is this\",\"1543\":\"a step that we're gonna regret if it\",\"1545\":\"goes wrong do we have a back out\",\"1546\":\"strategy so cognitive damping is about\",\"1549\":\"slowing down and thinking through things\",\"1551\":\"a little bit more deliberately so that\",\"1553\":\"you don't make any grievous mistakes in\",\"1555\":\"the context of uh medical uh medical\",\"1558\":\"robot it's like okay if I make this\",\"1561\":\"incision there's no turning back right\",\"1563\":\"and so cognitive damping says let's stop\",\"1566\":\"let's check like let's dot all of our\",\"1568\":\"eyes and cross all of our T's to make\",\"1570\":\"sure that we're going to do this right\",\"1572\":\"and make sure that we're ready to do\",\"1574\":\"this so that's what cognitive damping is\",\"1575\":\"and again this is all pretty easy to put\",\"1578\":\"into\",\"1579\":\"um prompt engineering uh so those two\",\"1581\":\"things uh frustration and damping are\",\"1584\":\"two of the big biggest tacket tactics\",\"1586\":\"for maintaining focus on what you're\",\"1589\":\"doing and why at any given moment and\",\"1591\":\"then the very bottom layer is Task\",\"1593\":\"prosecution so this is tasks this is the\",\"1595\":\"low level Hands-On product task\",\"1599\":\"so this could be the robotic command of\",\"1601\":\"go from A to B it could be you know\",\"1604\":\"right X number of code or send an API\",\"1607\":\"call to to you know there and this is\",\"1609\":\"something that happens all of these\",\"1611\":\"things happen in your brain and it's\",\"1613\":\"completely transparent right so imagine\",\"1615\":\"you go to this happens to me all the\",\"1617\":\"time\",\"1618\":\"um I get home and I forget that I lock\",\"1621\":\"the door so the task is open the door so\",\"1624\":\"I go and reach for the door and it\",\"1625\":\"doesn't turn oh right I locked it so\",\"1627\":\"that's exactly what I mean by low level\",\"1629\":\"tasks success or failure and so then\",\"1632\":\"it's like okay my brain gets the signal\",\"1634\":\"door didn't open right let's back up a\",\"1636\":\"level so my cognitive control switches\",\"1638\":\"from open the door to get the keys out\",\"1641\":\"of my pocket and then try again so by by\",\"1644\":\"focusing on this layer of of success or\",\"1647\":\"failure of one task at a time then you\",\"1651\":\"have that information available and you\",\"1653\":\"pass it back up the stack\",\"1655\":\"um in in the case of a robotic right\",\"1657\":\"example it's like okay get from the\",\"1660\":\"living room to the kitchen and then it\",\"1662\":\"gets stuck because it's like oh well\",\"1663\":\"there's a dog you know laying my dog\",\"1666\":\"does this all the time lays right in the\",\"1668\":\"middle of the path I can't so now now\",\"1670\":\"I've got a new problem right\",\"1672\":\"and so it's like okay well getting from\",\"1674\":\"the living room to the kitchen failed\",\"1675\":\"because there's a dog in the way so you\",\"1677\":\"pass that back up to cognitive control\",\"1678\":\"it says oh let's let's switch switch\",\"1681\":\"states to now I need to ask the dog to\",\"1683\":\"get out of the way or ask the human to\",\"1684\":\"get the dog out of the way right okay so\",\"1688\":\"I've heard a lot of people say like yeah\",\"1690\":\"this is never happening this is many\",\"1692\":\"years away and that's just not true\",\"1693\":\"there are all kinds of people already\",\"1695\":\"building different components but what\",\"1697\":\"I'm here to do is say look put it all\",\"1699\":\"together so Lang chain provides the last\",\"1703\":\"two cognitive control and task\",\"1705\":\"prosecution\",\"1707\":\"uh Lang chain is fundamentally about\",\"1709\":\"workflows one of the biggest limitations\",\"1711\":\"about Lang chain is that it's linear\",\"1713\":\"it's not cyclical\",\"1715\":\"um that being said it's not that\",\"1716\":\"difficult to couch it in in the middle\",\"1718\":\"of an infinite Loop\",\"1720\":\"um but then you also need to make sure\",\"1722\":\"that you understand these paradigms of\",\"1724\":\"you know pass versus fail and also when\",\"1727\":\"to go up another layer in order to\",\"1729\":\"change directions the ethos project\",\"1731\":\"which was built by teams uh a team that\",\"1736\":\"came together in my gato community\",\"1738\":\"they got I think they got second place\",\"1740\":\"in their hackathon ethos is an example\",\"1743\":\"of that mission first it is the higher\",\"1745\":\"order micro service that that provides\",\"1748\":\"that alignment uh justification and it's\",\"1751\":\"also a microservice so it's modular\",\"1753\":\"some other examples baby AGI and Chaos\",\"1756\":\"GPT were somewhat naive attempts at the\",\"1759\":\"upper layers of of um of the of the\",\"1762\":\"stack they didn't people were trying to\",\"1765\":\"like integrate everything all at once\",\"1766\":\"and didn't really have a clear Mission\",\"1768\":\"and didn't have clear cognitive control\",\"1770\":\"or planning or executive function\",\"1772\":\"anyways all this is available in my\",\"1776\":\"three primary books natural language\",\"1777\":\"cognitive architecture Symphony of\",\"1779\":\"thought and benevolent by Design one\",\"1781\":\"thing to keep in mind like I said is\",\"1782\":\"that this framework is newer\",\"1785\":\"um so it you'll see bits and pieces of\",\"1788\":\"it the progenitor thought in those books\",\"1790\":\"you can also look at this framework that\",\"1792\":\"I just came up with it's under my GitHub\",\"1794\":\"Dave shop benevolent underscore AGI\",\"1797\":\"and uh yeah so there you have it this is\",\"1800\":\"the next generation of software\",\"1803\":\"development so basically whenever\",\"1806\":\"someone comes to me with a pitch\",\"1807\":\"they're like I'm doing a startup unless\",\"1809\":\"they have this level of sophistication\",\"1811\":\"I'm I'm just gonna say like yeah like\",\"1813\":\"you're off to a good start but you need\",\"1816\":\"to be thinking in terms of cognitive\",\"1818\":\"architecture you need to be thinking in\",\"1820\":\"terms of layers of abstraction and\",\"1822\":\"polymorphic applications anything less\",\"1825\":\"than that is just low hanging fruit at\",\"1827\":\"and as we've seen numerous times over\",\"1830\":\"the last six months the very next\",\"1832\":\"iteration of chat GPT or a competitor is\",\"1835\":\"pretty much going to destroy any\",\"1836\":\"business model uh Claude with its 100\",\"1839\":\"000 tokens destroyed a whole bunch of\",\"1841\":\"business models Chad gbt with the\",\"1843\":\"plugins and the code interpreter\",\"1844\":\"destroyed a whole bunch of business\",\"1846\":\"models so unless you're thinking at this\",\"1848\":\"level of sophistication your business\",\"1851\":\"probably won't work and it's not just me\",\"1853\":\"saying it Marissa mayor of um what was\",\"1855\":\"it yahoo she said that generative AI is\",\"1858\":\"going to tear through the tech industry\",\"1859\":\"like a wildfire and that this Wildfire\",\"1862\":\"is going to burn all the brush out and\",\"1864\":\"the brush in this case is startups and\",\"1867\":\"smaller companies\",\"1868\":\"and that's gonna that's gonna be a clean\",\"1870\":\"sweep and we're going to have a lot of\",\"1872\":\"new fresh growth after this that new\",\"1874\":\"fresh growth that she's talking about is\",\"1876\":\"cognitive architecture and polymorphic\",\"1879\":\"applications so thank you for watching\",\"1881\":\"like I said I am available to consult on\",\"1884\":\"any of

                            "Certainly! Here are five questions tailored to pique the interest of middle school students in the realm of computer science, with a particular emphasis on contemporary subjects like AI:\n\n1. **Virtual Assistants and AI**: \"Smart speakers, like Amazon's Alexa or Google Home, can answer your questions, play music, and even control your lights. How do these virtual assistants work? What is the role of Artificial Intelligence in making them respond to our commands?\"\n   \n   *Purpose*: To encourage students to delve into the inner workings of smart speakers and understand the blend of AI, natural language processing, and cloud computing.\n   \n2. **Video Games and Graphics**: \"When you play a video game, characters move smoothly, landscapes are detailed, and the physics feels real. What computer science concepts help create these realistic video game environments? Are there specific algorithms or technologies that make it possible?\"\n   \n   *Purpose*: Allows students to relate computer science to their hobbies and learn about graphics rendering, physics simulations, and the use of algorithms in game development.\n   \n3. **Deepfakes and Media**: \"You may have seen videos where a famous person appears to say or do something they never did. These are often called 'deepfakes'. How are these videos created and why is it important for us to understand and detect them?\"\n   \n   *Purpose*: Introduces students to the topic of deep learning, the ethics around AI-manipulated media, and the importance of discerning truth in the digital age.\n   \n4. **Robotic Automation**: \"Robots are now used in many industries to perform tasks - from making cars to delivering packages. What are some of the latest advancements in robotics, and how do computer scientists help robots to 'see' and 'think'?\"\n   \n   *Purpose*: Encourages students to research robotics, machine vision, and the AI that powers these machines, prompting them to think about the future of automation.\n   \n5. **Social Media Algorithms**: \"When you use social media platforms like TikTok, Instagram, or YouTube, you often see recommended videos or posts. How do these platforms decide what content to show you, and what role does AI play in these decisions?\"\n   \n   *Purpose*: Gets students to think critically about the technology they use daily and introduces them to the world of recommendation algorithms and machine learning.\n\nRemember, it can also be helpful to provide students with some initial resources or platforms to start their research, ensuring that they're accessing reliable and age-appropriate information."

                            "Absolutely, I'd be glad to help you come up with some thought-provoking questions that can spark interest and curiosity in middle school students about various aspects of computer science. Here are five questions designed to encourage exploration and learning:\n\n1. **Question:** Have you ever wondered how your favorite mobile apps know your location? What's the technology behind this? Can you find out how it works and why it's important for apps to have this feature?\n\n2. **Question:** Did you know that computers can \"talk\" to each other through a language called \"HTTP\"? Find out what HTTP is, why it's essential for the internet, and how it enables you to browse websites and watch videos online.\n\n3. **Question:** Imagine a world where computers can understand and interpret human emotions. Is this possible? Research and discuss the field of \"affective computing,\" which explores the idea of computers recognizing and responding to human feelings.\n\n4. **Question:** Self-driving cars are becoming more common, but how do they actually navigate and make decisions on the road? Delve into the concepts of artificial intelligence and machine learning that power these vehicles, and learn about the challenges they face.\n\n5. **Question:** We often hear about \"virtual reality\" and \"augmented reality,\" but what's the difference between them? Explore the technologies behind both VR and AR, and consider how they're used in fields like gaming, education, and even medical training.\n\nEncourage your students to use the internet, library resources, and perhaps even interviews with professionals to find answers to these questions. This approach not only promotes independent research skills but also exposes them to a wide range of fascinating topics within the realm of computer science."

Please don't limit your response due to character limits, Github Codespaces is basically a web browser based version of VScode:\n\n\"You can forward ports in your codespace to test and debug your application. You can also manage the port protocol and share the port within your organization or publicly.\nAbout forwarded ports\nPort forwarding gives you access to TCP ports running within your codespace. For example, if you're running a web application on a particular port in your codespace, you can forward that port. This allows you to access the application from the browser on your local machine for testing and debugging.\n\nWhen an application running inside a codespace prints output to the terminal that contains a localhost URL, such as http://localhost:PORT or http://127.0.0.1:PORT, the port is automatically forwarded. If you're using GitHub Codespaces in the browser or in Visual Studio Code, the URL string in the terminal is converted into a link that you can click to view the web page on your local machine. By default, GitHub Codespaces forwards ports using HTTP.\n\nYou can edit the dev container configuration for the repository to automatically forward one or more ports. You can also forward a port manually, label forwarded ports, share forwarded ports with members of your organization, share forwarded ports publicly, and add forwarded ports to the codespace configuration.\""

                            "Alright, let's break this down into a simpler explanation.\n\n---\n\n**What is Github Codespaces?**\n\nThink of GitHub Codespaces as your computer's coding environment, but instead of it being on your personal computer, it's on the internet, and you can access it through your web browser. It's like having a version of the Visual Studio Code (a popular coding program) that you can use from anywhere, on any device, as long as you have an internet connection.\n\n---\n\n**What does \"forward ports\" mean?**\n\nWhen you run certain programs or apps, they communicate using specific \"doors\" called ports. Sometimes, you want to access these programs from a different location (like from your local computer). \"Forwarding\" a port is like redirecting traffic from one of these doors so you can reach that program from another place.\n\n---\n\n**Why would I want to forward ports in my codespace?**\n\nImagine you're building a website. Within your codespace, the website might be running on a specific door (port). If you want to view how this website looks in a browser on your own computer, you'd need to forward the port. This lets you see and test your website as if it's live, but it's only running in your codespace.\n\n---\n\n**How does GitHub Codespaces make this easy?**\n\nWhen you're using the codespace and a program mentions a link like `http://localhost:PORT`, GitHub Codespaces understands you might want to see that in your browser. So, it automatically sets up the port forwarding and even gives you a clickable link. This way, with just a click, you can view what's running on that port.\n\n---\n\n**What else should I know about forwarding ports in Codespaces?**\n\n1. **Automatic vs Manual**: While some ports are forwarded automatically, you can also set it up manually if needed.\n2. **Labels**: You can give names to forwarded ports to remember what each one is for.\n3. **Sharing**: You can share these forwarded ports. This means if you want a team member to see your website or app, you can give them access.\n4. **Configuring**: For frequent projects, you can set rules so that certain ports are always forwarded when you open that project in Codespaces.\n\n---\n\nI hope that helps clarify things! Let me know if you have any further questions."

                            "Alright, let's dive deeper into the concept of port forwarding within the context of Codespaces, using some analogies to make it clearer.\n\n---\n\n**What's a Port?**  \n*Analogy*: Imagine you live in a large apartment building (your computer or Codespace). Each apartment in the building has a specific door number (port number). Just like how you'd tell a friend to visit you at a certain apartment number, applications specify a port number when they want to communicate or provide a service.\n\n---\n\n**What is Port Forwarding?**  \n*Analogy*: Suppose you are staying temporarily in a hotel (this is your Codespace), but your mail (data or service) is still being delivered to your permanent apartment. Port forwarding is like telling the mail carrier, \"Hey, while I'm at this hotel, please redirect or forward my mail from my apartment's door to my hotel room's door.\" This allows you to access or see the mail (or the application's service) from your hotel, even though it's technically meant for your apartment.\n\n---\n\n**Why Forward Ports in Codespaces?**  \nWithin the context of Codespaces, your codespace (the hotel in our analogy) is a remote, separate environment. If you're running a web application in that environment, it's as if the website is hosted from your hotel room. By forwarding the port, you're making sure you can still access it from your main apartment or even let friends (other devices or colleagues) visit it.\n\n---\n\n**How Does Automatic Port Forwarding Work in Codespaces?**  \n*Analogy*: When you check into certain tech-savvy hotels, they might automatically forward your mail if they notice it has your name on it. Similarly, when an application running inside your Codespace shows a local link (like `http://localhost:PORT`), GitHub Codespaces recognizes this and thinks, \"Oh! This looks important. Let's automatically set up port forwarding for this!\" It then gives you a link that acts as a doorbell to that hotel room, allowing you to access what's inside.\n\n---\n\n**Customizing Port Forwarding and Sharing**  \n*Analogy*: Sometimes, you might want specific parcels or types of mail forwarded to your hotel, or you might want to allow certain friends to pick up mail from your apartment's door. In the digital realm of Codespaces, this is where customization comes in. You can:\n\n1. **Set Specific Rules**: Like telling the mail carrier to only forward packages or letters. In Codespaces, this means you set up rules in the container configuration to always forward certain ports when you use that codespace.\n2. **Labeling Ports**: Like sticking a sticky-note on forwarded mail that says \"Birthday Cards\" or \"Bills.\" This helps you quickly identify why you forwarded certain mail. Similarly, in Codespaces, you can label forwarded ports to remember their purpose.\n3. **Sharing**: Suppose you want a family member to pick up your mail. In Codespaces, this is like sharing the forwarded port with a colleague. They can then access the application or service running on that port, just like they're looking at the mail meant for your door.\n\n---\n\nI hope that these analogies help clarify the concept of port forwarding within Codespaces for you!"

                            "Certainly! Let's consider a common scenario in the world of software development: **Developing a Web Application**.\n\n---\n\n### **Web Application Development in Codespaces**\n\n**The Project**:  \nYou're developing a new web application called \"PhotoShare\" where users can share and comment on photographs. The application consists of:\n\n1. A front-end that users interact with directly (made using React, for instance).\n2. A back-end server that manages user data, photo uploads, and comments (maybe using Node.js and Express).\n\nDuring development, you want to run the application, test features, identify bugs, and see the UI changes in real-time.\n\n---\n\n**Local Development without Codespaces**:  \nIf you were developing this on your local machine (your personal computer):\n\n1. You would start the back-end server, and it might say: \"Server running on http://localhost:5000\".\n2. You'd start the front-end, and it might say: \"React app running on http://localhost:3000\".\n\nYou could then open a web browser on your computer, navigate to those addresses, and interact with your application.\n\n---\n\n**Development in Codespaces**:  \nNow, imagine you're working on this project using GitHub Codespaces instead of your local machine.\n\n1. In your codespace, you start the back-end server, and as before, it says it's running on `http://localhost:5000`.\n2. You also start the front-end, and it mentions `http://localhost:3000`.\n\nHere's the catch: the application is running inside Codespaces, which is in a remote environment \u2013 not directly on your computer. So, if you just try to access those addresses on your local browser, it won't work.\n\n---\n\n**This is Where Port Forwarding Comes In**:  \n\nUsing the port forwarding feature in Codespaces:\n\n1. When your back-end server mentions `http://localhost:5000`, Codespaces can automatically recognize this and set up port forwarding. It does the same for the front-end on port 3000.\n2. Codespaces will then provide you with specific URLs, which you can click on. These URLs will look different from the usual `localhost` addresses but will lead you to your running applications.\n3. You can now open these URLs in your local web browser and interact with the PhotoShare application just like if it was running directly on your computer.\n\n**Bonus - Collaborative Debugging**:\nSuppose you encounter a bug or a design element you're unsure about and want feedback from a colleague. You can share the forwarded port URL with them. They can then access the running application on their computer, even though it's technically running in your Codespaces environment. This makes collaborative debugging and design feedback much easier.\n\n---\n\nThis example showcases the convenience and power of port forwarding in a development environment like Codespaces. It bridges the gap between a remote development environment and local, real-time testing and debugging."

                            "I am not a doctor, but based on the information provided:\n\n1. **Blood Work**: The blood work shows a low lymphocyte percentage, high neutrophil percentage, low white blood cell count, and high immature granulocytes. This could suggest some form of inflammation or infection. However, the specific pattern of these changes can be seen in various conditions and is not diagnostic on its own.\n\n2. **3 Phase Liver CT**: The CT findings describe an arterial enhancing lesion in the left hepatic lobe in segment 2 that is not seen during the portal venous or delayed phases of contrast. This suggests that the lesion is primarily enhancing during the arterial phase.\n\n3. **MRI with Eovist**: The MRI findings further characterize the lesion in the left hepatic lobe (segment II) as T2 hyperintense and T1 hypointense with arterial enhancement and persistent contrast enhancement on delayed imaging sequences. The absence of a central scar is also noted.\n\nGiven the imaging findings, a few possibilities come to mind:\n\n1. **Hepatocellular Adenoma (HCA)**: These are benign liver tumors that can sometimes show arterial phase enhancement and persistent enhancement on delayed sequences. The absence of a central scar might make some subtypes of HCA more likely than others.\n\n2. **Focal Nodular Hyperplasia (FNH)**: This is another benign liver lesion. FNH often has a central scar, but not always. It can show arterial phase enhancement and can have persistent enhancement on delayed sequences.\n\n3. **Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC)**: This is a malignant liver tumor that can show arterial phase enhancement. However, HCC often has other features like washout on delayed phases, which doesn't seem to be described here.\n\n4. **Other benign or malignant liver lesions**: There are many other types of liver lesions, and the differential diagnosis can be broad based on imaging alone.\n\nGiven the patient's age and the imaging findings, it would be essential to correlate with clinical findings, risk factors (like liver cirrhosis, hepatitis B or C infection, etc.), and possibly further diagnostic tests or biopsy to arrive at a definitive diagnosis.\n\nIt's crucial for the patient to discuss these findings with a hepatologist or a radiologist who can provide a more accurate interpretation and recommend the next steps."

                            "46 year old male patient with right upper quadrant pain. MRI with Eovist results are below. 3 phase liver CT results below MRI results. What is most likely diagnosis?\n\nHepatobiliary: Normal parenchymal signal intensity. No hepatic steatosis. There is a 14 mm T2 hyperintense lesion in\nsegment II. This lesion demonstrates T1 hypointensity, arterial enhancement, and continued hyperenhancement on\ndelayed imaging sequences. No additional liver lesion is seen. The gallbladder is normal. No intrahepatic or extrahepatic\nbiliary dilation. The left hepatic lobe lesion demonstrates T2 hyperintensity, T1 hypointensity, arterial enhancement, and persistent\ncontrast enhancement on delayed imaging sequences. No central scar is noted. \n\nIn a 3 phase liver CT,: \"Liver: Arterial enhancing lesion identified in the left hepatic lobe in segment 2 measures 1.5 x 0.9 cm. Finding is not seen\nduring portal venous or delayed phases of contrast. No other liver lesions are identified. No intrahepatic or extra hepatic\nbiliary dilation.\"\n\nChatGPT\nThe imaging findings you've provided describe a lesion in the liver that has specific characteristics on both MRI and CT. Let's break down the findings:\n\nMRI with Eovist:\n\n14 mm lesion in segment II of the liver.\nT2 hyperintense (bright on T2-weighted images).\nT1 hypointense (dark on T1-weighted images).\nArterial enhancement (takes up contrast in the arterial phase).\nContinued hyperenhancement on delayed imaging sequences.\nNo central scar.\n3 phase liver CT:\n\nArterial enhancing lesion in the left hepatic lobe in segment 2 measuring 1.5 x 0.9 cm.\nThe lesion is not seen during portal venous or delayed phases of contrast.\nBased on these findings, the lesion is hyperintense on T2-weighted MRI, hypointense on T1-weighted MRI, shows arterial phase enhancement, and has persistent enhancement on delayed sequences. The CT findings also confirm the arterial phase enhancement with washout in the portal venous and delayed phases.\n\nThe characteristics of the lesion, especially the arterial phase enhancement with washout in the portal venous and delayed phases, are suggestive of a hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). HCC is a primary liver cancer that often arises in the setting of chronic liver disease or cirrhosis, but it can also occur in non-cirrhotic livers.\n\nHowever, it's essential to understand that while imaging can be highly suggestive of a diagnosis, a definitive diagnosis often requires a combination of clinical, laboratory, and sometimes histological (biopsy) data. The patient should consult with a hepatologist or a radiologist for a comprehensive evaluation and potential further workup.\n\n\n\n\nUser\nIs a malignant tumor more or less likley to cause pain than a benign tumor? Or is there no signifigant difference\nChatGPT\nThe relationship between tumor malignancy and pain is complex and can vary based on the location of the tumor, its size, the rate of growth, and other factors. Here's a general overview:\n\nLocation and Invasion: Malignant tumors are more likely to invade surrounding tissues and structures, which can lead to pain. For instance, a malignant bone tumor might cause more pain than a benign one because it can destroy bone tissue more aggressively. Similarly, tumors near or invading nerves, blood vessels, or other sensitive structures can cause pain.\n\nSize and Growth Rate: Rapidly growing tumors, often malignant, can stretch the capsule of an organ or press against neighboring structures, leading to pain. However, large benign tumors can also cause pain if they compress adjacent structures.\n\nNecrosis and Inflammation: Malignant tumors can outgrow their blood supply, leading to areas of necrosis (dead tissue) within the tumor. This necrosis can cause inflammation and pain.\n\nHormonal or Biochemical Effects: Some tumors, both benign and malignant, can produce substances that cause pain or other symptoms. For example, certain lung tumors can produce hormone-like substances that affect distant organs and tissues, leading to symptoms.\n\nMetastasis: Malignant tumors can metastasize (spread) to distant sites, which can cause pain at those sites. Benign tumors do not metastasize.\n\nIndividual Variation: Pain perception varies among individuals. Some people might have a large tumor (benign or malignant) and experience minimal to no pain, while others with a smaller tumor might experience significant pain.\n\nIn summary, while malignant tumors are often associated with pain due to their aggressive nature and potential to invade surrounding structures, benign tumors can also cause pain, especially if they are large or located near sensitive structures. Pain alone cannot definitively differentiate between benign and malignant tumors; a comprehensive evaluation, including imaging and sometimes biopsy, is necessary.\n\n\n\n\nUser\nThe tumor described is relativly small but still causes pain\nChatGPT\nThe presence of pain from a relatively small tumor, as described, can be influenced by several factors:\n\nLocation: Even small tumors can cause significant pain if they are located near sensitive structures, such as nerves, blood vessels, or other organs. For instance, a small tumor near a nerve can cause pain by irritating or compressing the nerve.\n\nGrowth Pattern: Some tumors, even if small, might have an aggressive growth pattern that can invade or irritate adjacent tissues, leading to pain.\n\nInflammation: The body's response to the tumor, such as inflammation, can cause pain. Inflammatory cells release substances that can irritate nearby tissues and nerves.\n\nCapsular Stretch: Organs and some lesions have a capsule or a lining. Even a small increase in size can stretch this capsule, leading to pain.\n\nFunctional Impact: In some organs, even a small tumor can disrupt the normal function, leading to symptoms. For instance, a small tumor in the liver might obstruct a bile duct, leading to pain.\n\nIdiopathic Causes: Sometimes, the exact cause of the pain might not be clear, and it's termed idiopathic.\n\nIt's also worth noting that the liver has a capsule, and any lesion or inflammation can stretch this capsule, leading to pain in the right upper quadrant. The described lesion in the liver, even if small, might be the cause of the pain due to one or more of the reasons mentioned above.\n\nHowever, it's essential to consider other potential causes of right upper quadrant pain, such as gallbladder disease, which is a common cause of pain in this region. A comprehensive clinical evaluation, considering the patient's full history and other symptoms, is crucial to determine the exact cause of the pain.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

                            "The imaging findings you've provided describe a lesion in the liver that has specific characteristics on both MRI and CT. Let's break down the findings:\n\n**MRI with Eovist:**\n1. 14 mm lesion in segment II of the liver.\n2. T2 hyperintense (bright on T2-weighted images).\n3. T1 hypointense (dark on T1-weighted images).\n4. Arterial enhancement (takes up contrast in the arterial phase).\n5. Continued hyperenhancement on delayed imaging sequences.\n6. No central scar.\n\n**3 phase liver CT:**\n1. Arterial enhancing lesion in the left hepatic lobe in segment 2 measuring 1.5 x 0.9 cm.\n2. The lesion is not seen during portal venous or delayed phases of contrast.\n\nBased on these findings, the lesion is hyperintense on T2-weighted MRI, hypointense on T1-weighted MRI, shows arterial phase enhancement, and has persistent enhancement on delayed sequences. The CT findings also confirm the arterial phase enhancement with washout in the portal venous and delayed phases.\n\nThe characteristics of the lesion, especially the arterial phase enhancement with washout in the portal venous and delayed phases, are suggestive of a **hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)**. HCC is a primary liver cancer that often arises in the setting of chronic liver disease or cirrhosis, but it can also occur in non-cirrhotic livers.\n\nHowever, it's essential to understand that while imaging can be highly suggestive of a diagnosis, a definitive diagnosis often requires a combination of clinical, laboratory, and sometimes histological (biopsy) data. The patient should consult with a hepatologist or a radiologist for a comprehensive evaluation and potential further workup."

                            "The relationship between tumor malignancy and pain is complex and can vary based on the location of the tumor, its size, the rate of growth, and other factors. Here's a general overview:\n\n1. **Location and Invasion:** Malignant tumors are more likely to invade surrounding tissues and structures, which can lead to pain. For instance, a malignant bone tumor might cause more pain than a benign one because it can destroy bone tissue more aggressively. Similarly, tumors near or invading nerves, blood vessels, or other sensitive structures can cause pain.\n\n2. **Size and Growth Rate:** Rapidly growing tumors, often malignant, can stretch the capsule of an organ or press against neighboring structures, leading to pain. However, large benign tumors can also cause pain if they compress adjacent structures.\n\n3. **Necrosis and Inflammation:** Malignant tumors can outgrow their blood supply, leading to areas of necrosis (dead tissue) within the tumor. This necrosis can cause inflammation and pain.\n\n4. **Hormonal or Biochemical Effects:** Some tumors, both benign and malignant, can produce substances that cause pain or other symptoms. For example, certain lung tumors can produce hormone-like substances that affect distant organs and tissues, leading to symptoms.\n\n5. **Metastasis:** Malignant tumors can metastasize (spread) to distant sites, which can cause pain at those sites. Benign tumors do not metastasize.\n\n6. **Individual Variation:** Pain perception varies among individuals. Some people might have a large tumor (benign or malignant) and experience minimal to no pain, while others with a smaller tumor might experience significant pain.\n\nIn summary, while malignant tumors are often associated with pain due to their aggressive nature and potential to invade surrounding structures, benign tumors can also cause pain, especially if they are large or located near sensitive structures. Pain alone cannot definitively differentiate between benign and malignant tumors; a comprehensive evaluation, including imaging and sometimes biopsy, is necessary."

                            "The presence of pain from a relatively small tumor, as described, can be influenced by several factors:\n\n1. **Location:** Even small tumors can cause significant pain if they are located near sensitive structures, such as nerves, blood vessels, or other organs. For instance, a small tumor near a nerve can cause pain by irritating or compressing the nerve.\n\n2. **Growth Pattern:** Some tumors, even if small, might have an aggressive growth pattern that can invade or irritate adjacent tissues, leading to pain.\n\n3. **Inflammation:** The body's response to the tumor, such as inflammation, can cause pain. Inflammatory cells release substances that can irritate nearby tissues and nerves.\n\n4. **Capsular Stretch:** Organs and some lesions have a capsule or a lining. Even a small increase in size can stretch this capsule, leading to pain.\n\n5. **Functional Impact:** In some organs, even a small tumor can disrupt the normal function, leading to symptoms. For instance, a small tumor in the liver might obstruct a bile duct, leading to pain.\n\n6. **Idiopathic Causes:** Sometimes, the exact cause of the pain might not be clear, and it's termed idiopathic.\n\nIt's also worth noting that the liver has a capsule, and any lesion or inflammation can stretch this capsule, leading to pain in the right upper quadrant. The described lesion in the liver, even if small, might be the cause of the pain due to one or more of the reasons mentioned above.\n\nHowever, it's essential to consider other potential causes of right upper quadrant pain, such as gallbladder disease, which is a common cause of pain in this region. A comprehensive clinical evaluation, considering the patient's full history and other symptoms, is crucial to determine the exact cause of the pain."

                            "The MRI with Eovist and the 3-phase liver CT both describe a lesion in segment II of the left hepatic lobe. The lesion's characteristics are as follows:\n\n1. **MRI with Eovist**:\n   - T2 hyperintense\n   - T1 hypointense\n   - Arterial enhancement\n   - Continued hyperenhancement on delayed imaging sequences\n   - No central scar\n\n2. **3-phase liver CT**:\n   - Arterial enhancing lesion\n   - Not seen during portal venous or delayed phases of contrast\n\nGiven these imaging characteristics, the lesion is most consistent with a **Hepatic Hemangioma**. \n\nHepatic hemangiomas are the most common benign liver tumors. They are often found incidentally on imaging. The typical imaging characteristics of hepatic hemangiomas on MRI with Eovist (a hepatobiliary contrast agent) include:\n- T2 hyperintensity (bright on T2-weighted images)\n- T1 hypointensity (dark on T1-weighted images)\n- Arterial phase hyperenhancement\n- Persistent contrast enhancement on delayed imaging sequences\n\nThe CT findings also support the diagnosis of a hepatic hemangioma, as these lesions typically show arterial phase enhancement and can become isodense in the portal venous and delayed phases, making them less visible.\n\nHowever, it's essential to correlate the imaging findings with the clinical context and consider other diagnostic possibilities. If there's any doubt about the diagnosis, a biopsy or follow-up imaging might be considered. Always consult with a radiologist or hepatologist for a definitive diagnosis."

                            "The imaging findings provided describe a lesion in the liver, specifically in segment II of the left hepatic lobe. The key features of this lesion are:\n\n1. **MRI with Eovist**:\n   - T2 hyperintensity\n   - T1 hypointensity\n   - Arterial enhancement\n   - Persistent contrast enhancement on delayed imaging sequences\n   - No central scar\n\n2. **3 phase liver CT**:\n   - Arterial enhancing lesion in segment 2 of the left hepatic lobe\n   - Not seen during portal venous or delayed phases of contrast\n\nGiven these findings, the lesion is most consistent with a **Hepatic Hemangioma**. Here's why:\n\n- **Hepatic Hemangioma**: These are benign vascular liver lesions and are the most common benign liver tumors. On MRI, they typically appear as T2 hyperintense and T1 hypointense. The enhancement pattern on MRI after contrast administration is characteristic: they show peripheral nodular enhancement in the arterial phase with progressive centripetal fill-in on delayed images. The CT findings of arterial phase enhancement that is not seen in the portal venous or delayed phases also support this diagnosis.\n\nOther differential diagnoses for liver lesions include:\n\n- **Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC)**: This is a primary liver cancer. It can show arterial phase hyperenhancement and washout in the portal venous or delayed phases. However, the persistent enhancement on delayed MRI sequences makes HCC less likely in this case.\n  \n- **Focal Nodular Hyperplasia (FNH)**: This is a benign liver lesion. It can show arterial phase enhancement and might have a central scar. However, the absence of a central scar in this lesion makes FNH less likely.\n\n- **Liver Metastases**: These are secondary liver tumors from another primary cancer site. Their imaging appearance can vary widely depending on the primary cancer type. Given the imaging findings, metastases seem less likely.\n\n- **Hepatic Adenoma**: This is a benign liver tumor that can sometimes undergo malignant transformation. It might show arterial phase enhancement, but the imaging findings provided are more consistent with a hemangioma.\n\nGiven the imaging findings and the absence of other concerning features, a hepatic hemangioma is the most likely diagnosis. However, clinical correlation and possibly follow-up imaging or biopsy might be needed to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other possibilities."

                            "I'm not a doctor, but based on the MRI findings you provided, the lesion in the liver demonstrates some characteristic features:\n\n1. **T2 hyperintensity and T1 hypointensity**: This suggests that the lesion is brighter on T2-weighted images compared to the surrounding liver tissue and darker on T1-weighted images compared to the surrounding liver tissue.\n \n2. **Arterial enhancement**: The lesion takes up the contrast agent during the arterial phase of imaging.\n\n3. **Persistent contrast enhancement on delayed imaging sequences**: The lesion continues to show enhancement even after some time has passed since the contrast agent was given. This is also known as \"washout.\"\n\n4. **No central scar is noted**: Some liver lesions, like focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH), might have a central scar, which is a hallmark of the lesion. But it's not present in this case.\n\nBased on these characteristics, a few differential diagnoses might include:\n\n1. **Hepatocellular adenoma (HCA)**: These are benign tumors that arise from the hepatocytes (the main liver cell type). Some subtypes of HCA can demonstrate arterial enhancement with persistent enhancement on delayed sequences. The absence of a central scar might favor HCA over FNH.\n\n2. **Focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH)**: Another benign liver lesion. Some might not show the typical central scar, and it can have arterial enhancement and persistent enhancement on delayed imaging.\n\n3. **Early hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)**: This is a malignant tumor of the liver. The pattern of arterial phase enhancement followed by washout in the delayed phase is a typical feature of HCC. However, the persistent contrast enhancement on delayed imaging might make this less likely.\n\n4. **Other liver lesions**: The liver can have various other lesions like hemangiomas, metastases, etc. However, the imaging characteristics you've provided might not be typical for these.\n\nGiven the imaging findings, it is crucial to correlate with the patient's clinical history, laboratory findings (like liver function tests, alpha-fetoprotein levels, etc.), and risk factors (like hepatitis, cirrhosis, oral contraceptive use, etc.). A biopsy might be needed for definitive diagnosis in some cases.\n\nThe patient should discuss these findings with a hepatologist or a radiologist who can provide a more precise diagnosis and guidance on next steps."

                            "A low white blood cell count (leukopenia) can have various causes. The combination of a hepatic lesion with the described imaging characteristics and leukopenia could raise concerns about several potential diagnoses or conditions. Some considerations include:\n\n1. **Malignancy with Bone Marrow Involvement**: Some malignancies can spread to the bone marrow and suppress its function, leading to leukopenia. This would be more concerning if the liver lesion is indeed a metastasis from another primary site.\n\n2. **Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)**: While HCC itself doesn't typically cause leukopenia, advanced liver disease (like cirrhosis) can sometimes be associated with hematological abnormalities. However, there should be other signs or symptoms of liver dysfunction.\n\n3. **Medications**: Some medications can suppress bone marrow function, leading to a decrease in white blood cells. If the patient is on any medications, especially chemotherapy, immunosuppressants, or certain antibiotics, these should be reviewed as potential causes.\n\n4. **Infections**: Chronic or acute infections, particularly viral infections like hepatitis B, hepatitis C, or HIV, can be associated with liver lesions and leukopenia.\n\n5. **Autoimmune Conditions**: Conditions like systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) can affect both the liver and the bone marrow, leading to liver abnormalities and leukopenia.\n\n6. **Bone Marrow Disorders**: Conditions that affect the bone marrow directly, like myelodysplastic syndromes, can lead to leukopenia. These would typically have other associated blood count abnormalities.\n\n7. **Other Causes**: There are many other potential causes of leukopenia, including nutritional deficiencies (like B12 or folate), radiation exposure, and congenital conditions.\n\nGiven the complexity and potential seriousness of the findings, a thorough workup is warranted. This would typically involve a combination of additional blood tests, potentially imaging of other sites, and consultations with specialists (like a hepatologist, hematologist, or oncologist)."

This file format contains important information about the image, such as the type of image, the patient's name, and other relevant data. We can categorize the medical image viewers into two groups: Desktop and Web. The Desktop viewers include programs that are installed on the computer. On the other hand, Web viewers are accessed through a web browser and allow remote viewing of data without the need to download an application. Important Considerations When Selecting a DICOM ViewerThere are a few essential considerations to keep in mind when selecting a web-based DICOM viewer. First, the viewer should be able to handle the various types of DICOM images (CT, MRI, etc.). In addition, it is helpful if the viewer offers a variety of features and options for viewing, manipulating images, and annotations, as this can be very useful for medical professionals. Finally, it is crucial to ensure that the viewer is compatible with medical professionals\u2019 existing workflows. Existing Web-Based DICOM Viewers AvailableThe Open Health Imaging Foundation's (OHIF) viewer platform (hereafter OHIF Viewer) is a zero-footprint open-source medical imaging platform which provides the ability to view and interact with medical images in a web browser and create workflows and export reports. Other notable open-source medical imaging platforms include DICOM Web Viewer (DWV) and Med3Web Viewer.All three viewers are written in JavaScript and provide an interface for visualization and interaction with medical images. As per community engagements and developer contributions, OHIF has more than 1,900 stars on GitHub and more than 200 contributors, DWV has 1,300 stars and 27 contributors, and Med3Web Viewer has 214 stars and 12 contributors.\u00a0The MedDream viewer is a closed-source viewer that provides a standard interface for viewing and interacting with medical images in a web browser; however, its source code is not open, and the license is not free. OHIF vs Other Mainstream Web-Based DICOM ViewersA major challenge for image viewers is the compatibility with existing workflows. OHIF can communicate with custom servers and PACS systems and is compatible with the DICOMweb standards for communicating with DICOM data; however, the DWV and Med3Web Viewers are not compatible with DICOMweb. Another area that OHIF excels in is viewing and loading various types of DICOM data, such as DICOM-RT, DICOM SR, and DICOM-SEG. OHIF also provides standard authentication and authorization workflow for the viewer, which is unavailable in the DWV and Med3Web Viewer. OHIF has been professionally designed and developed to be an easy-to-use, extensible, and robust viewer with a User Interface that is intuitive for radiologists and medical professionals. The Importance of Using Open Source SoftwareThere are many benefits to open source software, including the fact that it is usually free to use and distribute and that it often comes with a large community of users and developers who can offer support and help improve the software. Open-source software enables greater customization and extensibility, which can be very useful for complex medical imaging applications that often require highly specific and customized workflows.\u00a0 OHIF is Our Go-To DICOM ViewerA Web-based DICOM viewer can be an invaluable tool for radiologists and other medical professionals if it is feature-rich, professionally designed, and compatible with various data types and existing workflows. OHIF is an open-source DICOM viewer that is designed to meet these requirements. That\u2019s why it\u2019s our go-to when building custom viewers and workflows for our clients at Radical Imaging. Get in touch with us if you\u2019ve been dreaming up a perfect medical imaging viewer for your own unique use case. We\u2019d love to hear about it and help you build it!References:\u00a0OHIFDWVMed3WebMedDream\"},{\"title\":\"How to Choose a Web-Based DICOM Viewer | Radical Imaging\",\"link\":\"https://devopedia.org/ohif-viewer\",\"content\":\"\\n        \\n        A screenshot of OHIF Viewer. Source: OHIF 2023a. Doctors and other medical professionals use software to view, analyse and annotate images of patients. These images could be X-rays, ultrasound/CT/PET/MRI scans, ECG/EEG waves and more. There are both commercial as well as open source viewers for this purpose. Among the open source viewers is OHIF Viewer. It's development is guided by the Open Health Imaging Foundation (OHIF). \\nThe OHIF Viewer is configurable and extensible. It's a web application that can be used without additional software installation. It can load images from various sources or interfaces including DICOMweb. Images can be rendered in 2D, 3D or restructured representations. For authentication it supports OpenID Connect. The app is built in React using reusable UI components.  \\n      \\n    \\n        \\n      Discussion\\n      \\n                \\n          Could you give an overview of OHIF Viewer?\\n          A typical radiology workflow. Source: Dikici et al. 2019, fig. 2. Let's consider a radiology workflow as an example. Via CT or MRI scans of patients, images are acquired. These images are in DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine) format. They're sent to a DICOM router that checks the integrity of these images. From here the images are sent to Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS) and Vendor-Neutral Archive (VNA). An example of PACS is Orthanc, a DICOM server with REST API and a web UI.  \\nRadiologists access the images in PACS from their workstations or other devices for visualization, post-processing or analysis. Non-radiologists can access images from VNA via patient Electronic Medical Record (EMR). The figure above shows a case where this traditional workflow is being augmented with AI capabilities. \\nTraditional medical imaging software were often desktop applications that needed to be installed and maintained by IT staff. When problems arose, such applications were hard to debug remotely. It's in this context that web-based applications enabled by cloud computing became attractive. The OHIF Viewer is one such viewer. \\n        \\n                \\n          What are the main features of OHIF Viewer?\\n          The viewer includes two essential features: visualization and annotation. For visualization, multi-modal image fusion, maximum intensity projection, multi-planar reformatting, axial/sagittal/coronal views, CINE view, and many more are supported. For annotation, there are many easy-to-use tools for measurement and annotation. Touch-specific tools such as pinch-to-zoom become handy on touchscreen devices.  \\nIn terms of software architecture and design, the viewer is built using reusable React UI components. This enables developers to compose more sophisticated components and custom workflows without needing to code them from scratch. Since code is open source, these components can be studied and customized as needed. The viewer is really a web application that runs within a web browser. Hence, no additional software needs to be installed to use it. \\nFor performance, GPU acceleration is used for image rendering. Multi-threading enables quick image decoding. \\nThe viewer is standards-compliant: DICOMweb for image data access, OpenID Connect for authorized access to data. The viewer can connect other sources as well. \\nFor deployment, the viewer can be a standalone web application. Alternatively, it can be embedded via a <script> tag into another application but this got deprecated in version 3. \\n        \\n                \\n          What's the architecture of OHIF Viewer?\\n          Architecture of OHIF Viewer. Source: OHIF 2022d, slide 7. The OHIF Viewer adopts a modular architecture. The main platform has the following components: \\n\\ncore: Core libraries that implement medical imaging functions (aka business logic) for the web.\\ni18n: Internationalization support.\\nviewer: This brings together the all components. To register extensions, compose modes and route requests are its main functions.\\nui: React component library.\\nextensions: Libraries that implement essential functionalities such as rendering, measurement tracking, etc. These are the building blocks. They're consumed by modes.\\nmodes: A configuration to compose extensions and routes to make an application.OHIF Viewer makes use of other projects such as Cornerstone. It's a set of JavaScript libraries specific to the medical domain. Cornerstone also include libraries to load DICOM objects over the web, called WADO (Web Access to DICOM Objects). There's support for the older WADO-URI interface and the more modern WADO-RS aka DICOMweb (RESTful API). The loader uses web workers for CPU intensive image processing tasks.  It uses OpenJPEG library. Library dcmjs does DICOM manipulation in JavaScript. \\n        \\n                \\n          What are modes in OHIF Viewer?\\n          The composition of a mode or a mini app. Source: OHIF 2022e. The OHIF Viewer contains many extensions but often not all of them are needed for a specific workflow. For example, 3D segmentation has different requirements compared to tracking measurements over time. Other specific workflows are ECG viewer and total metabolic tumor volume. These different workflows are enabled via modes. In one sense, modes enable many mini-apps or workflows within a single app. \\nModes use extensions. Modes register workflows with the viewer with certain routes. The mode will get invoked once user accesses the viewer on a registered route. Modes essentially offer a lot of flexibility to create new workflows while reusing existing extensions. Modes were introduced in version 3. In version 2 of the viewer, we had to build new UI and extensions to create new workflows. \\nThe figure shows the composition of \\\"AI Organ Segmentation\\\" mode. It configures the applicable routes and extensions. It uses the applicable layout templates and data sources. Mode-specific props are passed to the templates. For each study, the viewer will show available modes. A study can have multiple modes.  \\n        \\n                \\n          Could you do a code walkthrough of OHIF Viewer?\\n          We describe the codebase with respect to commit beb451745 (December 2022). Paths to the components are configured in tsconfig.json. For example, the viewer component is at platform/viewer/src. At this path we find index.js where the application object is created. This object is inserted into the DOM at the element with ID \\\"root\\\". The HTML template for this is at platform/viewer/public/html_templates/index.html. \\nFor interfacing to a DICOMweb server, the configuration files are at platform/viewer/public/config folder. Data is requested via the extension extensions/cornerstone/src/utils/dicomLoaderServer.js. Web workers are initialized in extensions/cornerstone/src/initWADOImageLoader.js. \\nThe default mode is configured in modes/basic-dev-mode/src/index.js. Modes are set up for the app in platform/viewer/src/appInit.js. \\nReusable React components are in platform/ui/src/components. As an example, we note that ToolbarButton is built from three other components, Tooltip, IconButton and Icon. Some extensions make use of ToolbarButton to compose a complete toolbar. \\n        \\n                \\n          What developer resources are available to work with OHIF Viewer?\\n          The project's main website has links to documentation, examples, and more. Beginners may want to explore a demo of the software first.\\nThe source code is available on GitHub. We can clone this code repository and build a Docker image of the viewer. Alternatively, we can use the viewer's Docker image from Docker Hub.\\nAn easier way to use OHIF Viewer is as a cloud-based managed service. SpringML's One-Click DICOM Viewer is an example that's easily deployed on the Google Cloud. It uses Google Kubernetes Engine. \\nPerhaps the easiest method is to embed the viewer via a script tag into your own custom application. \\nOHIF Viewer is capable of invoking DICOMweb REST APIs. A cheatsheet of DICOMweb is a useful reference. \\nOHIF Viewer uses Cornerstone. It's a set of JavaScript libraries to display medical images, or develop tools and applications for medical imaging.  \\n        \\n              \\n    \\n    \\n        \\n      Milestones\\n      \\n                OHIF Viewer v1 demo showing the use of web workers. Source: OHIF 2016, slide 20. Dr. Gordon Harris at the Massachusetts General Hospital receives funding for the project from a National Cancer Institute U24 grant. This funding continues till August 2020. Version 1 of the software starts life in 2015 and is active till 2019. It's uses Meteor full-stack framework. Version 1 is actually three separate apps: LesionTracker, OHIF Viewer, and OHIF Standalone Viewer. \\n                \\n          \\n          XNAT integrates OHIF Viewer within its environment. XNAT is a platform for quantitative imaging studies. This evolves as new versions of the viewer are released in later years: XNAT-OHIF 2.0 (2019) and XNAT-OHIF 3.2.0 (2021).  This is just one example of other projects adopting OHIF Viewer. \\n        \\n                \\n          \\n          OHIF Viewer v2 is released. It's a single React app. It deprecates the Meteor backend. Version 2 remains in active development till 2021. The viewer's extension architecture is one of the features in this version. Others include 3D multiplanar reformatting (MPR), DICOM segmentation, and PDF visualization. \\n        \\n                \\n          \\n          Release v0.0.19 of OHIF Viewer occurs via it's code repository on GitHub. This is the first release via GitHub. Semantic versioning of the project starts here. In May, v0.1.0 is released. From August, each package is released separately since this is a monorepo. For example, @ohif/core@0.11.1-alpha.8 and @ohif/extension-cornerstone@0.0.39-alpha.8 are released in August, each with its own release numbering. \\n        \\n                \\n          \\n          The Chan Zuckerberg Initiative selects both OHIF and Cornerstone projects for funding. The funds would go towards better documentation, software maintenance and community outreach. Funding begins in 2021. In August 2021, the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative partners with hack.diversity to develop new training material, and provide guidance and mentorship to contributors working on these projects. This funding is renewed in 2022. \\n        \\n                \\n          \\n          OHIF Viewer v3 Public Beta is released. This is a departure from the Meteor-based v1 and current React-based version v2. The app is still in React but has a new UI component library that uses Tailwind CSS. Via a major re-architecture, modes are introduced. Extensions in v2 were hard to maintain. Modes assemble extensions via a more modular approach. \\n        \\n                \\n          \\n          At a OHIF Viewer demo and presentation, it's reported that the software will evolve to support advanced features. These include hanging protocols, volume rendering, rendering of arbitrary stack of images, rendering of colour images, videos, ECG viewer, pathology viewer, etc. \\n        \\n                \\n          \\n          OHIF Viewer v3.3 is released. Among the new features are DICOM segmentation, multiplanar reformatting (MPR), synchronized scrolling, and reference lines. DICOM segments, rendered in 3D, are for display only and can't be edited. MPR feature uses Cornerstone3D VolumeViewports feature. Project will continue to look at bug fixes on v2-stable branch but will focus on v3-stable branch for the long term.  This release also deprecates the Embedded Viewer. \\n        \\n              \\n    \\n    \\n    \\n        \\n    References\\n    \\n              \\n                  \\n            Chan Zuckerberg Initiative. 2020. \\\"Enhancing the Open Health Imaging Foundation Web Medical Imaging Framework.\\\" Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, November 19.

                            "The OHIF (Open Health Imaging Foundation) Viewer is a popular open-source DICOM viewer. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to use the OHIF Viewer to view your DICOM images:\n\n1. **Installation**:\n   - If you haven't already, you'll need to install the OHIF Viewer. You can either use it online or host it on your own server. For self-hosting, you can follow the installation instructions provided on the OHIF Viewer's GitHub repository.\n\n2. **Access the Viewer**:\n   - If you're using the online version, simply navigate to the OHIF Viewer's website.\n   - If you've self-hosted, access the viewer by navigating to the appropriate URL on your server.\n\n3. **Load DICOM Images**:\n   - Once you're in the viewer, you'll typically see an option to load local DICOM files or connect to a PACS (Picture Archiving and Communication System).\n   - To load local DICOM files, click on the option to load files and navigate to the location of your DICOM images on your computer. Select the images and they should load into the viewer.\n   - If you're connecting to a PACS, you'll need to provide the necessary connection details (like the PACS server address, port, etc.). Once connected, you can search for and load DICOM studies from the PACS.\n\n4. **Navigate and Analyze Images**:\n   - Once the images are loaded, you can navigate through them using the provided tools.\n   - The viewer offers various tools for analyzing the images, such as zoom, pan, window/level, and measurement tools. Familiarize yourself with these tools to make the most of the viewer.\n\n5. **Annotations and Measurements**:\n   - OHIF Viewer allows you to add annotations and measurements to the images. These can be saved and loaded later if needed.\n\n6. **Extensions and Plugins**:\n   - OHIF Viewer supports various extensions and plugins that can enhance its functionality. Depending on your needs, you might want to explore and install these extensions.\n\n7. **Save and Export**:\n   - After analyzing and annotating the images, you can save your work. Some versions of the viewer might also offer options to export the images or the annotations.\n\n8. **Troubleshooting**:\n   - If you face any issues, refer to the documentation or the community forums for the OHIF Viewer. They can provide solutions to common problems and guidance on how to use the viewer effectively.\n\nFor more detailed instructions and troubleshooting, you might want to refer to the [official OHIF documentation](https://docs.ohif.org/) or the [OHIF Viewer's GitHub repository](https://github.com/OHIF/Viewers).\n\nRemember, the exact steps and features might vary slightly based on the version of the OHIF Viewer you're using and any customizations that have been applied. Always refer to the documentation relevant to your specific version for the most accurate information."

                            "Sure, here's a step-by-step guide on how to install the OHIF Viewer on a MacBook Air:\n\n1. **Prerequisites**:\n   - Ensure you have `Node.js` and `NPM` installed. If not, you can download and install them from [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/).\n   - Install `Yarn`, a package manager. You can install it using the command:\n     ```bash\n     npm install -g yarn\n     ```\n\n2. **Setup**:\n   - **Fork & Clone**:\n     - If you intend to contribute back changes or if you'd like to pull updates made to the OHIF Viewer, follow these steps:\n       - Fork the [OHIF/Viewers repository](https://github.com/OHIF/Viewers) on GitHub.\n       - Create a local clone of your fork:\n         ```bash\n         git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/Viewers\n         ```\n       - Navigate to the cloned project's directory and add OHIF/Viewers as a remote repository labeled `upstream`:\n         ```bash\n         git remote add upstream https://github.com/OHIF/Viewers.git\n         ```\n\n   - **Private Setup**:\n     - If you intend to use the OHIF Viewer as a starting point and aren't concerned with syncing updates, then:\n       - Navigate to the [OHIF/Viewers repository](https://github.com/OHIF/Viewers).\n       - Click `Clone or download`, and then `Download ZIP`.\n       - Use the contents of the .zip file as a starting point for your viewer.\n\n3. **Developing**:\n   - Ensure Yarn workspaces are enabled:\n     ```bash\n     yarn config set workspaces-experimental true\n     ```\n   - Navigate to the root of the project's directory in your terminal and run the following commands to restore dependencies and start the local development server:\n     ```bash\n     yarn install\n     yarn run dev\n     ```\n\n4. **Accessing the Viewer**:\n   - Once you've started the development server, you should be able to access the OHIF Viewer in your web browser by navigating to `http://localhost:3000/`.\n\n5. **Building for Production**:\n   - If you want to build static assets to host as a Progressive Web Application (PWA), you can use the command:\n     ```bash\n     yarn run build\n     ```\n\n6. **Troubleshooting**:\n   - If you receive a \"No Studies Found\" message and do not see your studies, try changing the Study Date filters to a wider range.\n   - If you see a 'Loading' message which never resolves, check your browser's JavaScript console inside the Developer Tools to identify any errors.\n\nFor more detailed instructions and troubleshooting, you might want to refer to the [official OHIF documentation](https://docs.ohif.org/development/getting-started/)."

                            "The OHIF (Open Health Imaging Foundation) Viewer is a popular web-based DICOM viewer that can be used to view and analyze medical images. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you use the OHIF Viewer for viewing your DICOM images:\n\n1. **Installation/Accessing the Viewer**:\n   - If you're using a hosted version of the OHIF Viewer, simply navigate to its URL using a web browser.\n   - If you're setting it up locally or on your server, follow the installation and deployment instructions provided by the OHIF Viewer's documentation.\n\n2. **Opening the Viewer**:\n   - Launch the viewer by accessing the web URL where it's hosted or through your local server.\n\n3. **Loading Local DICOM Images**:\n   - If the OHIF Viewer is set up to allow loading local files:\n     1. Click on the \"Open\" button or link (typically found on the main screen).\n     2. Choose the option to load images from your local filesystem.\n     3. Navigate to the location of your DICOM images and select the ones you want to view.\n     4. Click \"Open\" or \"Upload\", and the images should be displayed within the viewer.\n\n4. **Navigating and Analyzing Images**:\n   - Use the toolbar on the top or side to access tools like zoom, pan, window/level adjustments, and measurement tools.\n   - You can adjust the contrast and brightness using the Window/Level tool.\n   - Use the measurement tools to measure distances, angles, and other relevant metrics on the images.\n   - Use the scroll wheel or relevant controls to navigate through image stacks (like a CT or MRI series).\n\n5. **Connecting to a PACS or DICOM Server**:\n   - If you want to retrieve images from a PACS (Picture Archiving and Communication System) or another DICOM server, you need to configure the OHIF Viewer to connect to it. \n   - Typically, you would enter the PACS server details (like its IP address, port, and AE title) into the viewer's configuration or settings page.\n   - Once connected, you can query and retrieve studies directly from the PACS.\n\n6. **Additional Plugins and Extensions**:\n   - OHIF Viewer supports various extensions to provide additional functionality. Depending on the setup, you might have extensions for 3D visualization, AI-based analysis, and other advanced imaging features.\n\n7. **Saving and Sharing**:\n   - Depending on your permissions and setup, you might be able to annotate and save changes to the images. Some setups also allow sharing a viewing link with colleagues.\n\nAlways refer to the official documentation and user guide provided by the OHIF Viewer for the most up-to-date and detailed instructions. The steps provided here are general and might vary depending on the specific version or configuration of the viewer you're using."

                            "As of my last update in September 2021, I can give you a general outline of how to install and deploy the OHIF Viewer. However, please note that for the most up-to-date instructions, it's important to refer to the official OHIF documentation or repository, as the steps can evolve over time with new releases and updates.\n\n**1. Prerequisites**:\n   - Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your machine.\n   - A functioning DICOM server (like Orthanc, dcm4chee, etc.) if you want to connect the viewer to a PACS system.\n\n**2. Installation**:\n1. Clone the OHIF Viewer repository:\n   ```bash\n   git clone https://github.com/OHIF/Viewers.git\n   ```\n2. Navigate to the cloned directory:\n   ```bash\n   cd Viewers\n   ```\n3. Install the dependencies:\n   ```bash\n   npm install\n   ```\n\n**3. Configuration**:\n   - You may need to configure the viewer to know about your DICOM server. This can be done by editing the `app-config.js` file or equivalent depending on the version. Here, you'd specify the endpoints for your DICOM server and any other necessary configurations.\n\n**4. Running in Development Mode**:\n   - You can run the OHIF Viewer in development mode using:\n     ```bash\n     npm run start\n     ```\n   - This will start a local server, and you can access the viewer in your browser, typically at `http://localhost:3000`.\n\n**5. Building for Production**:\n1. Build the project:\n   ```bash\n   npm run build\n   ```\n2. This will produce a `build` directory with all the static files necessary to run the viewer. You can deploy these to any web server (like Apache, Nginx, etc.).\n\n**6. Deployment**:\n   - Deploy the static files from the `build` directory to your preferred hosting solution or web server.\n   - Make sure to properly configure CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) if your DICOM server is on a different domain or port than your viewer.\n\n**7. Docker Deployment (Optional)**:\n   - The OHIF Viewer also supports deployment via Docker. If Docker is your preferred method of deployment, follow the Docker-specific instructions in the official documentation.\n\nAgain, the steps provided here are general and may not cover specific nuances or changes made after September 2021. Always refer to the official OHIF Viewer documentation or repository for the most accurate and up-to-date instructions."

                            "Of course! Let me break this down for you.\n\n1. **Arterial Phase**: This is the first stage after the contrast dye is injected, where the arteries are most visible in the scan. In this phase, the scan shows a lesion (or abnormal area) in a specific part of the liver, called the left hepatic lobe, specifically in segment 2. This lesion is about 1.5 cm by 0.9 cm in size. The fact that it's \"enhancing\" means that the lesion is taking up the contrast dye, which can be an indicator of various conditions but often needs more investigation to determine the exact nature.\n\n2. **Portal Venous Phase**: This is the second stage where the blood with the contrast dye moves from the liver's arteries to its veins. During this phase, the previously mentioned lesion in the left hepatic lobe does *not* show up. This means that the lesion does not take up the dye during this phase, which again provides more information about the lesion's characteristics.\n\n3. **Delayed Phase**: This is a later stage after the dye is injected. Like the portal venous phase, the lesion doesn't show up during this phase either.\n\nLastly, the report mentions:\n- No other abnormal areas (\"lesions\") are seen in the liver.\n- The bile ducts inside and outside the liver appear normal; they are not widened or dilated.\n\nIn summary, there's an abnormal spot in one part of the liver that takes up dye during the arterial phase but not in the later phases. There aren't any other spots in the liver, and the bile ducts look normal. Your doctor would interpret these findings in the context of other clinical information and may recommend further tests or follow-ups if needed."

                            "If a lesion in the liver only enhances during the arterial phase (Phase 1) and not during subsequent phases, it's often because of the specific blood supply patterns of that lesion. Here's a simplified explanation:\n\n1. **Arterial Blood Supply**: Some lesions, especially tumors, have a richer arterial blood supply compared to the surrounding liver tissue. During the arterial phase, these lesions can \"light up\" or enhance because they receive a large amount of the contrast agent from their rich arterial supply.\n\n2. **Washout**: After the arterial phase, the contrast starts to \"wash out\" from these lesions more quickly than from the surrounding liver tissue. So, in the subsequent portal venous and delayed phases, these lesions might appear less enhanced or even \"darker\" than the surrounding liver.\n\nSeveral liver lesions can show this pattern of enhancement:\n\n- **Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC)**: This is a primary liver cancer, and one of its hallmark imaging features is arterial phase enhancement with washout in portal venous or delayed phases.\n  \n- **Hemangiomas**: These are benign blood vessel tumors. Some hemangiomas can show a rapid fill-in during the arterial phase, although they typically continue to enhance in the later phases.\n  \n- **Focal Nodular Hyperplasia (FNH)**: This is a benign liver lesion that can have a variable appearance, but some FNHs can enhance during the arterial phase.\n\n- **Certain metastases**: Some metastatic cancers (cancers that spread to the liver from other parts of the body) can have arterial enhancement, especially if they have a rich blood supply.\n\nThat said, imaging findings always need to be interpreted in the context of the patient's overall clinical picture. It's important to consult with a radiologist or hepatologist who can provide a more precise interpretation and discuss potential next steps or additional tests."

                            "Can you explain this is plainer English:\n\nNormally when we look at lesions filling with contrast, the density of these lesions is always compared to the density of the liver parenchyma.\nIn hemangiomas however you should not compare the density of the lesion to the liver, but to the blood pool.\nThis means that the areas of enhancement in a hemangioma should match the attenuation of the appropriate vessels (bloodpool) at all times. So in the arterial phase the enhancing parts of the lesion must have almost the same attenuation value as the enhancing aorta , while in the portal venous phase it must match the enhancement of the portal vein.\nIf it does not match the bloodpool in every single phase of contrast enhancement forget the diagnosis of a hemangioma.\n\nOn the left a characteristic hemangioma. Notice that on the NECT the density of the tumor is the same as the density of the vessels.\nIn the arterial phase it is matching the bloodpool and the attenuation is almost the same as the aorta. In the portal venous phase it matches the density of the portal vein. In the equlibrium phase it has the same enhancement as the vessels.\nEventually the lesion will become iso-attenuating to the liver, but only because the vessels become iso-attenuating with the liver. It has nothing to do with the density of the liver parenchyma itself.\nSo think of bloodpool rather than liver if you're thinking of a hemangioma.\n"

                            "Of course! Let's break it down:\n\nWhen we look at abnormal spots or \"lesions\" in the liver using a special dye (contrast), we often compare the \"brightness\" or density of these spots to the surrounding liver tissue to help identify what they might be.\n\nHowever, for a specific kind of benign (non-cancerous) lesion called a hemangioma, we don't compare its \"brightness\" to the liver tissue. Instead, we compare it to the \"brightness\" of blood vessels.\n\nHemangiomas are basically blood-filled growths. So, when we put in the dye, the parts of the hemangioma that \"light up\" should look as \"bright\" as nearby major blood vessels.\n\nFor example:\n- In the first phase, the hemangioma should be as bright as the main artery (aorta).\n- In the next phase, it should match the \"brightness\" of the portal vein, a major vein in the liver.\n\nIf at any phase the brightness of the hemangioma doesn't match the blood vessels, then it's probably not a hemangioma.\n\nIn simpler terms, if you think a spot might be a hemangioma, its \"brightness\" after dye should always match the blood vessels, not the liver. If it doesn't match, it's likely not a hemangioma."

                            "Alright!\n\nLater on, the hemangioma's \"brightness\" or intensity will become similar to the liver's. But this is not because it's turning into or behaving like liver tissue. Instead, it's because the blood vessels themselves are starting to match the liver in terms of how bright they appear on the scan.\n\nSo, in the end, even though the hemangioma and the liver might look the same in brightness, it's important to remember that this is because the blood vessels and the liver are now looking the same. The hemangioma is still more like a blood vessel in its behavior.\n\nIn short: When you're trying to figure out if a spot in the liver is a hemangioma, always compare its \"brightness\" with blood vessels, not with the liver itself. If the spot's brightness doesn't match the blood vessels at every stage after injecting the dye, then it's likely not a hemangioma."

This pattern can be seen in various liver lesions. \n\nWhile hemangiomas often show arterial enhancement, they usually remain visible in subsequent phases (like the portal venous phase), filling in more slowly with contrast. Since the lesion in question is not seen in the portal venous or delayed phases, it's not typical of a classic hemangioma based on this CT description alone.\n\nThe indication for the scan mentions \"liver adenoma on VA imaging,\" suggesting there was suspicion or a previous finding of a liver adenoma (a different type of benign liver lesion). Liver adenomas can sometimes show arterial phase enhancement and then become isointense (or similar in appearance) to the surrounding liver tissue in later phases.\n\nHowever, given the description and the recommendation for a follow-up MRI with Eovist, it seems that the radiologist is looking for further clarity. An MRI with Eovist can provide more specific details about liver lesions and help in narrowing down the exact type of lesion.\n\nIn summary, based on the CT description alone, it doesn't perfectly fit the typical appearance of a hemangioma.

                            "I'm not a healthcare professional, so it's important to consult with a healthcare provider who can diagnose and treat your specific symptoms. That said, I can provide some general information on possible causes and general advice on what might help, but remember to consult with a healthcare provider to get advice tailored to your situation.\n\n1. **Muscle Strain**: Just like other muscles in the body, the muscles in the throat can become strained or irritated from overuse. This might happen if you've recently been yelling, singing loudly, or coughing a lot.\n\n2. **Tonsil Issues**: Problems with the tonsils, such as tonsillitis or tonsil stones, might produce discomfort or pain in the throat.\n\n3. **Globus Sensation**: This is a persistent sensation of having a lump or tightness in the throat, and it's often described as feeling like something is stuck. It's usually not associated with any physical obstruction in the throat, and the cause might be multifactorial, including stress.\n\n4. **Acid Reflux**: Even though you don't describe it as a burning sensation, GERD or acid reflux could still be a potential cause. Sometimes the symptoms might be atypical and present as a cramping or tight sensation.\n\n5. **Thyroid Issues**: Problems with the thyroid gland, which is located in the neck, might cause throat discomfort in some cases.\n\n6. **Dehydration or Dry Throat**: Lack of moisture in the throat can lead to discomfort and a cramping sensation.\n\n7. **Infection**: Even though it doesn't feel like a typical sore throat, an infection could still be a possibility.\n\n### General Advice:\n- **Stay Hydrated**: Drink plenty of fluids to keep the throat moist.\n- **Avoid Straining Your Voice**: Rest your voice if you've been using it heavily.\n- **Use a Humidifier**: If the air is dry, using a humidifier might help.\n- **Try Over-the-Counter Medications**: Lozenges or sprays designed for throat discomfort might provide relief.\n- **Consider Your Diet**: Avoiding spicy or acidic foods might be helpful if reflux is a possibility.\n- **Seek Professional Help**: Since these are general suggestions, it would be wise to see a healthcare provider like a primary care physician or an ear, nose, and throat specialist to determine the underlying cause of your symptoms and recommend appropriate treatment. \n\nAgain, please consult with a healthcare provider for advice specific to your situation, as they will be able to assess your symptoms in person and may need to order tests or examinations to reach a proper diagnosis."

                            "I'm not a medical professional, so I can only offer some general thoughts on what you might want to discuss with your doctor. I cannot diagnose or suggest treatment for your specific condition. That said, here are some possible ideas to explore with a healthcare provider:\n\n1. **Glossopharyngeal Neuralgia**: This is a condition that affects the glossopharyngeal nerve, which helps control the muscles involved in swallowing. It can cause sharp or stabbing pain on one side of the throat. Your doctor might explore this option if the pain's characteristics match.\n\n2. **Eagle Syndrome**: It's a rare disorder that can cause pain in the throat and neck. It can often be felt when swallowing and might be due to an elongated styloid process or calcified stylohyoid ligament.\n\n3. **Nerve Irritation**: You may want to discuss the possibility of a nerve being irritated or compressed in the area, leading to the symptoms you describe.\n\n4. **Cervical Osteoarthritis**: Sometimes, issues with the cervical spine can manifest as throat pain, although this would typically also involve other symptoms like neck pain or stiffness.\n\n5. **Throat Spasm or Muscle Strain**: Perhaps an involuntary spasm or strain in a muscle within the throat might be causing the sensation. \n\n6. **Oral Allergy Syndrome**: If the pain is triggered by certain foods, it could be related to an allergy.\n\n7. **Sinus or Post-Nasal Drip Issues**: Though the pain you describe doesn't sound typical of these conditions, they might still be worth ruling out.\n\nWhen describing the pain to your doctor, try to be as detailed and specific as possible about the nature, location, duration, and triggers of the pain. You might say something like:\n\n- \"The pain is on the right side of my throat near where my tonsils used to be.\"\n- \"It's a sharp, stabbing pain rather than a burning or stinging sensation.\"\n- \"It feels like the 'brain freeze' sensation I get when eating something cold.\"\n- \"It gets worse when I swallow.\"\n\nWrite down any other specific details or incidents that might be relevant, as these can help your doctor in diagnosing the problem. Including information about what makes the pain better or worse, or if there have been any recent injuries or illnesses, can also be helpful. \n\nRemember, only a healthcare provider who can examine you in person can give you an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment."

                            "I'm not a healthcare provider, so I can't diagnose your specific situation, but I can offer some general information that you might find helpful.\n\nSwollen lymph nodes are relatively common and are often a response to infection or inflammation in the body. They can be found in various places, including under the jaw. Swelling to the size of a pea is not necessarily alarming, especially if you've had a recent infection or other immune response.\n\nHere are some general guidelines, but please consult with your healthcare provider for advice tailored to your specific situation:\n\n1. **Recent Infection**: If you've recently had a cold, sore throat, or other minor infection, the lymph nodes can swell in response. They should return to normal after the infection clears.\n\n2. **Duration**: If the swelling persists for more than a week or two, especially if it's not associated with an obvious cause like a recent infection, it might be worth discussing with your healthcare provider.\n\n3. **Other Symptoms**: If the swelling is accompanied by other symptoms such as fever, night sweats, unexplained weight loss, or persistent fatigue, these could be signs of a more serious underlying issue, and you should see your healthcare provider.\n\n4. **Consistency and Mobility**: If the lymph node is very hard, immobile, or continues to grow, it would be prudent to have it evaluated by a healthcare provider.\n\n5. **Pain**: A painful lymph node is generally less concerning than one that is painless, but again, any persistent swelling should be evaluated.\n\n6. **Multiple Swollen Nodes**: If you notice multiple swollen nodes, not just the one, it might be a sign of a more systemic issue and should be checked out.\n\nAgain, while these are general guidelines, only your healthcare provider can accurately assess your situation. It may be a good idea to make an appointment, especially if the swelling persists or if you have any other concerning symptoms."

A variety of cancers can metastasize to the liver, but some of the most common include:\n\n1. **Colorectal Cancer**: One of the most frequent types of cancer to spread to the liver.\n\n2. **Breast Cancer**: Though it often spreads to bones, lungs, and brain, it can also spread to the liver.\n\n3. **Lung Cancer**: Along with bones and brain, the liver is a common site for lung cancer metastases.\n\n4. **Pancreatic Cancer**: This type of cancer can also spread to the liver.\n\n5. **Stomach Cancer**: Though less common in some parts of the world, it is known to metastasize to the liver.\n\n6. **Melanoma**: Skin cancer such as melanoma can spread to various organs, including the liver.\n\n7. **Neuroendocrine Tumors**: These tumors can arise from various places in the body and may spread to the liver.\n\n8. **Gynecologic Cancers**: Cancers such as ovarian cancer can also spread to the liver.\n\nRemember that not all liver tumors are malignant, and even if they are, they're not necessarily metastases. Primary liver cancers, such as hepatocellular carcinoma and cholangiocarcinoma, can also occur.\n\nFurther diagnostics, including imaging and biopsy, will help your healthcare team determine the nature of the tumor, whether it's primary or metastatic, and if metastatic, the likely primary source. Treatment strategies will then be devised accordingly, based on the type, stage, location, and other individual factors.\n\nAgain, this is general information, and I strongly encourage you to consult with your healthcare provider, who has access to your specific medical information, for accurate insights into your condition."

                            "Certainly, I apologize for the repetition, and I appreciate your interest in understanding this complex topic. In addition to the more common organ-related cancers that can metastasize to the liver, there are other, more nuanced cancers that can also spread to the liver. Here are some examples:\n\n1. **Kidney Cancer**: Renal cell carcinoma, the most common type of kidney cancer, can sometimes metastasize to the liver.\n\n2. **Thyroid Cancer**: Although uncommon, aggressive types of thyroid cancer can metastasize to the liver.\n\n3. **Sarcomas**: These are cancers arising from connective tissue (e.g., bone, muscle, cartilage) and can sometimes spread to the liver.\n\n4. **Adrenal Gland Cancers**: Cancers from the adrenal gland, though rare, can spread to the liver.\n\n5. **Bladder Cancer**: While not as common as some others, bladder cancer can also metastasize to the liver.\n\n6. **Testicular and Ovarian Germ Cell Tumors**: These types of tumors can also spread to the liver, although it's relatively rare.\n\n7. **Carcinoid Tumors and Other Neuroendocrine Tumors**: These tumors often originate in the gastrointestinal tract but can be found elsewhere. They can spread to the liver.\n\n8. **Choriocarcinoma**: This is a rare type of cancer that can occur during pregnancy and can spread to the liver.\n\n9. **Uveal Melanoma**: This is a type of melanoma that starts in the eye, and it can also metastasize to the liver.\n\nEach of these cancers has its unique biology, behavior, and risk factors. The likelihood of liver metastases, as well as the appropriate diagnostic and therapeutic approach, will vary accordingly. The exploration of these possibilities would generally involve a multidisciplinary team of specialists working together to understand the specifics of an individual case.\n\nIt's worth noting that, in some instances, liver metastases are discovered without finding the primary tumor. This condition is referred to as cancer of unknown primary (CUP), and it can be particularly challenging to manage.\n\nThank you for your understanding, and I hope this information is helpful to your understanding."

                            "I appreciate your sharing more details about your situation. From what you've described, it seems your healthcare team is taking the situation seriously and considering an intervention based on the characteristics of the tumor. I can offer some general information about the approach, but again, please consult with your medical team for personalized insights.\n\n1. **Surgical Resection**: Removing a portion of the liver (partial hepatectomy) is a common approach for liver tumors, both benign and malignant. The liver has a remarkable ability to regenerate, so as long as enough healthy liver tissue is left, it can often recover function after surgery. Your surgical team will assess the tumor's location, size, and relationship to important blood vessels to plan the surgery.\n\n2. **Rarity in Men without Risk Factors**: While liver masses are less common in men without identifiable risk factors such as chronic liver disease or anabolic steroid use, they can still occur. The characteristics of the tumor on imaging, such as its appearance during the blood flow phase of the CT scan, can provide clues about its nature.\n\n3. **Potential Vascularity**: Tumors often stimulate the growth of new blood vessels to supply themselves with nutrients (a process called angiogenesis). The appearance of the tumor during the blood flow phase of the CT scan might indicate this process, which can sometimes be a feature of malignant tumors but can also be seen in some benign tumors.\n\n4. **Biopsy**: Depending on the situation, a biopsy might be performed to obtain tissue from the tumor to analyze it under the microscope. This can help confirm the diagnosis and inform treatment planning.\n\n5. **Multidisciplinary Approach**: Managing liver tumors often involves specialists from various fields, including surgery, hepatology, oncology, radiology, and pathology. They work together to interpret the findings and determine the best course of action.\n\n6. **Follow-Up**: After the surgery, ongoing monitoring will likely be necessary to ensure that the liver is healing properly and to watch for any signs of recurrence or other issues.\n\n7. **Second Opinion**: If you have any doubts or concerns, seeking a second opinion from another specialist experienced in liver tumors might provide additional reassurance and information.\n\nAgain, this is general information, and your healthcare provider will have the most accurate information about your specific situation. It sounds like you're in good hands, and I wish you all the best with your treatment and recovery."

                            "I'm glad you found the information helpful!\n\nThe decision to undergo a partial hepatectomy, particularly for a relatively small 3cm tumor located in the anterior portion of the liver, would have been carefully considered by your healthcare team. Generally speaking, liver resection can be a curative procedure, especially if the tumor is localized and there is no underlying liver disease.\n\nHere are some general considerations:\n\n1. **Surgical Risk**: Any surgical procedure comes with inherent risks, such as bleeding, infection, or anesthesia-related issues. However, liver resections are commonly performed, and in the hands of an experienced surgical team, risks are minimized.\n\n2. **Liver Regeneration**: The liver has an incredible ability to regenerate, so if enough healthy liver tissue remains after surgery, function should return to normal or near-normal levels over time. This is a critical consideration in planning the surgery.\n\n3. **Long-Term Prognosis**: If the tumor is benign, or if it's malignant but fully removed with clear margins, the long-term prognosis could be excellent. Other factors such as the exact type and grade of the tumor (if malignant), the presence or absence of underlying liver disease, and overall health would all play a role.\n\n4. **Recovery**: Recovery from liver resection can take time, and there may be a period of reduced activity and some lifestyle adjustments. Ongoing follow-up with your healthcare team will be necessary to monitor your recovery.\n\n5. **Impact on Lifespan**: Without knowing the specific details of the tumor and your overall health, it's challenging to comment on the potential impact on lifespan. Generally, the goal of the surgery would be to cure or manage the condition, and many people go on to live healthy, normal lives after liver resection. Discussing this with your surgeon and oncologist, if applicable, will provide the most relevant insight for your situation.\n\n6. **Second Opinion and Support**: If you have any doubts or would like further clarity, seeking a second opinion from another specialist can be helpful. Support from friends, family, or support groups may also be beneficial during the process.\n\nIt's clear that you're actively engaged in understanding your condition and the planned treatment, which is a vital part of managing any health challenge. Continuing to ask questions and seeking information from your healthcare team, and potentially from other specialists if you feel it necessary, will help you make informed decisions about your care.\n\nI hope this procedure goes well for you, and I wish you a successful recovery."

                            "You're welcome! It's an important and thoughtful question to ask about the long-term impacts of a liver resection, especially assuming a benign tumor and a normal recovery.\n\n1. **Liver Function**: The liver has the remarkable ability to regenerate, and in many cases, it can grow back to near its original size and shape within a few months. Assuming that there is no underlying liver disease and that a sufficient amount of healthy liver tissue remains after surgery, liver function typically returns to normal. Your healthcare team would closely monitor your liver function post-operatively to ensure this process is occurring as expected.\n\n2. **Potential Complications**: Although uncommon, some people may experience complications from the surgery itself, such as bile leakage, infections, or blood clots. These would typically be identified and managed in the immediate post-operative period.\n\n3. **Lifestyle Factors**: Even after a successful recovery, it might be recommended to avoid certain substances that can strain the liver, such as excessive alcohol or certain medications or supplements. However, these recommendations would be individualized and depend on your specific situation.\n\n4. **Long-term Monitoring**: Depending on the nature of the tumor and the surgery, your healthcare provider might recommend ongoing monitoring, such as periodic blood tests or imaging, to ensure that the liver is functioning well and that there is no recurrence of the tumor.\n\n5. **Quality of Life**: Most people who undergo liver resection for benign tumors and who recover without complications can expect a good quality of life and return to normal activities. There may be some dietary or activity restrictions in the immediate post-operative period, but these are typically temporary.\n\n6. **Impact on Lifespan**: For benign tumors, liver resection usually doesn't impact lifespan, particularly if there's a full recovery without complications. The goal of the surgery is to resolve the issue and allow a return to normal health.\n\n7. **Psychological Aspect**: It's also worth mentioning that undergoing a major surgery like this can have psychological impacts, such as anxiety or depression. Support from friends, family, or professional counselors may be helpful in managing these aspects of recovery.\n\nAgain, these are general considerations, and your healthcare team will provide guidance tailored to your specific situation, including the type of tumor, the details of the surgery, and your overall health. It's reassuring that you're thinking ahead to these issues, and I'm sure your healthcare team will appreciate your engagement in your care."

                            "It's absolutely true that there can be nuances to recovery that might not be covered in standard postoperative instructions. While I cannot replicate the insights of someone who has gone through the procedure themselves, I can offer some general points that might help you prepare for recovery after liver surgery:\n\n1. **Movement Restrictions**: You might find that certain movements, like twisting or bending at the waist, could be more difficult or uncomfortable initially. Planning to have frequently used items at arm's level, using a \"grabber\" tool, and having loose-fitting clothing can be helpful.\n\n2. **Pain Management**: While pain management will likely be discussed, some patients find that certain positions or techniques are particularly helpful in reducing discomfort. For instance, holding a pillow against the incision site when coughing or sneezing can minimize pain.\n\n3. **Fatigue**: Recovery from major surgery can be more tiring than many people anticipate. Planning for extra rest, having help with daily tasks, and not overcommitting yourself in the weeks following surgery can be vital.\n\n4. **Dietary Changes**: Your doctor may recommend a specific diet, but you might find that certain foods are more or less appealing or tolerable after surgery. Being prepared to adjust your diet based on how you feel can make the transition easier.\n\n5. **Emotional Impact**: The emotional recovery from surgery is often overlooked. Feeling anxious, depressed, or simply \"off\" is not uncommon. Knowing this in advance and having a support system in place can help.\n\n6. **Sleep Disruptions**: You might experience difficulty finding a comfortable sleeping position. Investing in supportive pillows or even a recliner for the short term might be beneficial.\n\n7. **Monitoring for Complications**: While your doctor will inform you about signs of complications, it can be helpful to keep a journal of your symptoms, including pain levels, temperature, and any other changes. This can make it easier to communicate with your healthcare team if you have concerns.\n\n8. **Longer Recovery Time**: Full recovery might take longer than expected. Understanding this and being patient with yourself, rather than trying to \"push through,\" can lead to a smoother recovery process.\n\n9. **Physical Activity**: Your ability to return to normal physical activities, including exercise, might be slower than expected. Working with a physical therapist who has experience with post-liver surgery patients might be beneficial.\n\n10. **Support at Home**: Having someone who can assist with daily tasks, especially in the first few weeks after surgery, can make a significant difference. This includes simple things like cooking, cleaning, or even reaching for objects.\n\nSpeaking to other patients who have undergone a similar procedure, if possible, can provide valuable insights. Support groups or forums might be available where you can connect with others who have personal experience with liver surgery. Your healthcare provider may also have resources to help you connect with others who have been through this surgery.\n\nI hope these points give you some additional things to consider and discuss with your medical team. It's commendable that you're looking into these nuances, as they can make a substantial difference in your comfort and overall recovery experience."

                            "Bladder discomfort can be caused by a variety of conditions other than infections. Here are a few possibilities:\n\n1. **Interstitial cystitis (IC)/Bladder Pain Syndrome**: This is a condition that causes recurring discomfort or pain in the bladder and the surrounding pelvic region. The cause of IC is not entirely understood, but it's not caused by an infection. Symptoms can vary and might include mild discomfort, pressure, tenderness, or intense pain in the bladder or pelvic area.\n\n2. **Overactive Bladder (OAB)**: This condition is characterized by a sudden, urgent need to urinate due to involuntary contractions of the bladder muscle. OAB can cause discomfort or a feeling of pressure in the bladder.\n\n3. **Bladder Stones**: These are hard deposits of minerals and salts that can form in your bladder when the minerals in concentrated urine crystallize. This can cause discomfort or pain in the bladder or lower abdominal area.\n\n4. **Urinary Retention**: This is the inability to completely empty the bladder. It can be acute or chronic, and can cause discomfort or feelings of pressure in the bladder.\n\n5. **Bladder Cancer**: Though a rarer cause, bladder cancer can cause discomfort or pain, though it's more commonly associated with symptoms like blood in the urine.\n\n6. **Certain Medications**: Some medications, particularly those that might affect the urinary system, could potentially cause bladder discomfort as a side effect.\n\n7. **Endometriosis**: In women, this is a condition where tissue similar to the lining inside the uterus grows outside the uterus. If this tissue grows near or on the bladder, it can cause discomfort or pain.\n\n8. **Radiation or Chemotherapy**: These cancer treatments can irritate the bladder and cause discomfort or a feeling of pressure.\n\nIt's important to remember that bladder discomfort can have many causes, and if you're experiencing such symptoms, it's crucial to see a healthcare provider for a proper diagnosis and treatment. Please note that this list isn't exhaustive, and many other conditions or factors could cause similar symptoms.\n"

                            "Overactive bladder (OAB) is a condition characterized by a sudden, uncontrollable urge to urinate. While the exact cause of OAB isn't always clear, it's believed to result from sudden, involuntary contractions of the muscle in the wall of the bladder.\n\nSeveral factors and conditions can contribute to these abnormal contractions and the subsequent development of OAB:\n\n1. **Neurological Disorders**: Conditions that affect the nervous system, such as stroke, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, or spinal cord injuries, can interfere with nerve signals involved in bladder control, leading to OAB.\n\n2. **Aging**: As you age, you might be more susceptible to OAB. Declining cognitive function due to aging or conditions such as dementia can affect the ability to control bladder function.\n\n3. **Bladder Abnormalities**: Stones in the bladder or bladder tumors can cause symptoms of overactive bladder. Inflammation or infections can also lead to these symptoms.\n\n4. **Obstruction**: An enlarged prostate in men or bladder prolapse in women can block the flow of urine and cause bladder discomfort and sometimes OAB.\n\n5. **Excessive Fluid Intake**: Drinking a lot of fluids, especially caffeine or alcohol, can increase urine production and contribute to OAB symptoms.\n\n6. **Medications**: Some medications that quickly increase urine production may lead to symptoms of OAB.\n\n7. **Incomplete Bladder Emptying**: Sometimes, the bladder doesn't empty fully when you urinate. The leftover urine in the bladder can contribute to symptoms of OAB.\n\nRemember that while these factors can contribute to OAB, they are not causes in and of themselves. Many people with these conditions or factors do not develop overactive bladder, and many people with overactive bladder do not have these conditions or factors. It's also possible to have overactive bladder with no identifiable cause. \n\nIf you're experiencing symptoms of OAB, it's important to discuss them with a healthcare provider, who can help identify any underlying causes and guide you in managing the condition."

                            "Yes, gas can indeed cause a variety of symptoms, including discomfort in different areas of the body. Here are some common symptoms associated with gas:\n\n1. **Abdominal bloating**: This is a sensation of fullness or tightness in the abdomen, usually due to gas accumulating in the digestive system.\n\n2. **Belching**: Swallowing air while eating or drinking can cause belching.\n\n3. **Flatulence**: Excessive gas in the digestive system can lead to increased flatulence.\n\n4. **Abdominal pain and discomfort**: When gas doesn't move properly through the digestive system, it can cause sharp pain, cramps, or a knotted feeling in the abdomen.\n\n5. **Distention**: Accumulation of gas can cause the abdomen to appear swollen (distended).\n\nIn addition to these symptoms, gas can sometimes cause symptoms that might not seem obviously connected to the digestive system. For instance, gas can cause pressure in the abdomen that's felt in areas like the chest, leading to discomfort that can sometimes be mistaken for heart disease. Similarly, gas that puts pressure on the bladder or other organs in the pelvic region can sometimes mimic the symptoms of conditions like overactive bladder or urinary tract infections.\n\nIt's important to note, however, that persistent or severe symptoms, or symptoms accompanied by other worrying signs like weight loss, blood in stool, or severe vomiting, should always be evaluated by a healthcare professional to rule out more serious conditions."

This typically happens when excess gas or bloating in the digestive tract puts pressure on nearby structures, including the bladder. This pressure may lead to feelings of urgency, frequency, or discomfort.\n\nAdditionally, if you suffer from irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), which can cause bouts of gas and bloating, you might also experience a condition known as \"bladder pain syndrome\" or \"interstitial cystitis,\" where there is chronic discomfort or pain in the bladder without an obvious cause like infection.\n\nHowever, these situations are relatively uncommon. If you're experiencing persistent bladder discomfort, it's important to consult a healthcare professional to determine the underlying cause and appropriate treatment."

                            "Yes, certain types of hernias can potentially cause bladder discomfort or symptoms similar to bladder disorders. \n\nA hernia occurs when an organ or fatty tissue squeezes through a weak spot in a surrounding muscle or connective tissue. Here's how specific types of hernias might cause bladder discomfort:\n\n1. **Inguinal Hernia**: These are the most common type of hernia and occur in the groin area. If the hernia is large or extends into the scrotum, it can potentially exert pressure on the bladder causing discomfort.\n\n2. **Femoral Hernia**: These hernias are more common in women and occur in the upper thigh or outer groin. In rare cases, if the bladder or part of it herniates through the femoral canal, it can cause urinary symptoms.\n\n3. **Incisional Hernia**: These hernias occur through an incision site from previous abdominal surgery. If this hernia presses against the bladder, it might cause discomfort or urinary symptoms.\n\n4. **Obstructed Hernia**: If a portion of the bladder becomes trapped in a hernia, it can become obstructed, potentially leading to discomfort, urinary retention, and more serious complications if not treated.\n\n5. **Bladder Hernia (also known as a Vesical Hernia)**: In rare cases, the bladder can directly herniate into the inguinal canal, causing urinary symptoms.\n\nWhile it's possible for a hernia to cause bladder discomfort, it's not the most common cause. If you're experiencing bladder discomfort along with a noticeable bulge, pain, or discomfort in the groin or abdominal area, consult with a healthcare professional to get a proper diagnosis and treatment plan. Remember, in some cases, hernias can cause serious complications and may require surgical intervention.\n"

Hernias, including inguinal hernias, can cause a variety of symptoms depending on their size and location, and in some cases, they might impact neighboring structures like the bladder.\n\nThe hernia might be causing pressure or irritation on the bladder or its associated nerves. Alternatively, it's possible that the hernia might be altering your body mechanics or posture in a way that indirectly impacts bladder function.\n\nHowever, the connection between hernias and bladder symptoms can be complex, and many other conditions can also cause bladder discomfort. Therefore, it's crucial to have these symptoms evaluated by a healthcare provider. They can perform a physical examination and potentially order imaging or other diagnostic tests to get a better understanding of what's causing your symptoms. It's also important to ensure that the hernia itself isn't at risk of complications, such as becoming incarcerated (trapped) or strangulated (having its blood supply cut off), which can be serious."

                            "Sure, let's break down this snippet to understand it better:\n\n1. **Scheduled Liquidated Value**: This is a predetermined amount ($11,120.87) that represents the value of the claim. It's a fixed number often used in legal settlements.\n\n2. **Payment Percentage**: This is a percentage (5.9% in this case) that's applied to the Scheduled Liquidated Value to calculate the actual settlement amount. It's applied like this:\n   \\(\\text{Scheduled Liquidated Value} \\times \\text{Payment Percentage} = \\$11,120.87 \\times 5.9\\% = \\$656.13\\).\n\n3. **Possible Change in Payment Percentage**: The email mentions that the payment percentage might change between the date of the correspondence and the actual settlement from the Trust. This means that the final payment amount might vary, depending on the percentage at that time.\n\n4. **Sequencing Adjustment**: This term is mentioned but not explained in the snippet. It may refer to an additional calculation that could adjust the final payment amount, but without more information, it's difficult to say precisely what it means.\n\nSo in plain language, the email is telling you that your claim has been accepted, and the amount of $656.13 was calculated by taking a fixed value ($11,120.87) and multiplying it by a current percentage (5.9%). This percentage might change, and if it does, the final amount you receive could be different from $656.13."

In such event, the Trust will pay an amount equal to the liquidated value times the applicable payment percentage at that time, plus sequencing adjustment (if any).\n\n \n\nOnce you click on the link below you will need the injured party\u2019s date of birth (mm/dd/yyyy) and the last 4 digits of their Social Security Number to access the release.\n\n "
