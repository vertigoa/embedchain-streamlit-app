The function returns a list of products that belong to the specified category. Here's a breakdown of each part:\n\n### Function Definition\n\n- `def get_products_by_category(category)`: This line defines a function named `get_products_by_category` that takes one argument, `category`.\n\n### List Comprehension Inside the Function\n\n- `[product for product in products.values() if product[\"category\"] == category]`\n\nThis is a list comprehension, a concise way to create lists in Python. Let's break it down:\n\n  - `products.values()`: This part iterates over the values of the `products` dictionary. Each value is itself a dictionary containing information about a product.\n  \n  - `product`: This variable temporarily holds each dictionary (i.e., each product information set) as the list comprehension iterates through `products.values()`.\n  \n  - `if product[\"category\"] == category`: This is a condition that filters the products. It checks if the `category` field in each `product` dictionary matches the `category` argument passed to the function.\n  \n  - `product for product in products.values() if product[\"category\"] == category`: This entire expression says, \"For each product in `products.values()`, include it in the new list only if its `category` matches the given `category`.\"\n\n### Function Return Value\n\n- `return`: The function returns the list generated by the list comprehension, which includes only the products that belong to the specified `category`.\n\nIn summary, the function `get_products_by_category` filters the products in the `products` dictionary based on their `category` and returns a list of those products."

The `f` before the opening triple quotes indicates that it's an f-string.\n\n### Components of the f-string\n\n- `Relevant product information:`: This is a static part of the string. It will appear as-is in the final string.\n  \n- `\\n`: This is the escape character for a new line. It will move the cursor to the beginning of the next line when the string is printed or displayed.\n  \n- `\\: Backslash at the end of the line indicates that the string continues on the next line. It allows you to break a long string into multiple lines in the code for readability, without actually breaking the string itself.\n\n- `{product_information_for_user_message_1}`: This is a placeholder where the value of the variable `product_information_for_user_message_1` will be inserted.\n\n### What happens when the code runs\n\nWhen this f-string is evaluated, Python will replace `{product_information_for_user_message_1}` with the actual value of the variable `product_information_for_user_message_1`. The `\\n` will create a new line before this information.\n\n### The `messages` List\n\nThe `messages` list contains dictionaries, each representing a message from different roles ('system', 'user', and 'assistant'). The 'content' key in each dictionary holds the corresponding message as its value.\n\n### The `get_completion_from_messages` Function\n\nThe code then calls a function named `get_completion_from_messages` (which is not defined in the snippet) with `messages` as its argument. We can assume that this function processes these messages in some way and returns a \"final response,\" which is then printed.\n\nSo, the `f\"\"\"Relevant product information:\\n\\ {product_information_for_user_message_1}\"\"\"` part is constructing a string with embedded variables and new lines, which is then used as the content of the assistant's message in the `messages` list."

                            "Yes, that's a likely interpretation. The `messages` list seems to be a sequence of interactions between the system, the user, and the assistant. The list could be used to set the context for a conversation model, guiding its behavior based on previous messages. The `'role':'assistant'` part with its `content` is probably there to set the expected output format or to serve as a \"primer,\" as you mentioned.\n\nIn this scenario, the `get_completion_from_messages` function would likely use the `messages` list to produce a model-generated response that is consistent with the provided context and priming. This generated response is stored in `final_response`, which is then printed out.\n\nSo, you're correct; the assistant's message in the `messages` list may not be directly shown to the user but is likely used to guide the model's behavior."

You'll need to have some key components in place for this to work smoothly:\n\n### Key Components:\n\n1. **Custom GPT Model**: You'll need your custom GPT model to be hosted and accessible via OpenAI's API.\n  \n2. **OpenAI Account**: Your OpenAI account will allow you to set up API keys for accessing the model, including the moderation endpoint.\n\n3. **Jupyter Notebook Environment**: A cloud-based or local setup where each student can access a copy of the Jupyter Notebook you've prepared.\n\n4. **Moderation Endpoint**: This will help you ensure that the generated content adheres to a set of guidelines, ensuring a safe and constructive learning environment.\n\n### Steps:\n\n1. **Create a Custom GPT Model**: First, create your custom GPT model using OpenAI's tools and guidelines.\n\n2. **Generate API Keys**: Once your custom model is ready, generate API keys from your OpenAI account that will be used to authenticate API requests.\n\n3. **Jupyter Notebook Setup**: Create a Jupyter Notebook that includes code to interact with your custom GPT model. Make sure to include:\n   - API key setup (preferably in an environment variable for security)\n   - Code to interact with the model\n   - Code to utilize the moderation endpoint\n\n4. **Distribute Notebooks**: Use a tool like JupyterHub, Google Colab, or a cloud-based Jupyter service to distribute copies of your Notebook to students. Each student should have their own isolated environment.\n\n5. **Guidelines and Documentation**: Provide clear guidelines and documentation on how to use the Notebook and interact with the GPT model.\n\n6. **Moderation**: Implement the moderation endpoint in the Notebook to filter out or flag content that doesn't meet your guidelines.\n\n7. **Monitoring and Support**: Keep an eye on usage and be prepared to assist students if they encounter issues or have questions.\n\nBy following these steps, you can set up a classroom environment where students can safely and effectively experiment with your custom GPT model."

                            "It appears that you're working with some kind of script that uses the delimiter `####` to separate different sections of a message or workflow. The key to understanding how the delimiter is being used lies in the context where it appears. In your example, the delimiter is used to separate steps or sections within a message. It serves as a marker, telling the reader or the program parsing the message that a new section or step is beginning.\n\nLet's break down the usage of the delimiter in your example:\n\n1. **In System Messages**: The delimiter `####` is used to mark the beginning of each step in the instructions. Here, it's similar to using a colon to indicate what follows is related to the step being described.\n  \n    - `Step 1:####`\n    - `Step 2:####`\n    - `Step 3:####`\n    - `Step 4:####`\n    - `Step 5:####`\n  \n2. **In User Messages**: The delimiter is used to enclose the user's query, essentially setting it apart from other parts of the message. \n\n    - `####{user_message}####`\n\nHow the application knows what is 'delimited' depends on how the code that processes these messages is written. Typically, the code would look for occurrences of the delimiter and then process the text that follows until the next delimiter is found, or until the end of the string, depending on the specific requirements.\n\nNote: The function `get_completion_from_messages(messages)` is not defined in the example you provided, so I can't comment on how it uses these delimiters. Normally, however, it would look for this delimiter to separate and process each section accordingly.\n\nIs there something specific you'd like to know more about?"

                            "The function `get_completion_from_messages` is designed to interact with the OpenAI API, specifically a GPT-3.5 Turbo model. It takes a list of message dictionaries as input, along with other optional parameters such as `model`, `temperature`, and `max_tokens`.\n\nHere's what each parameter does:\n\n- `model`: Specifies which language model to use for generating the response.\n- `temperature`: Controls the randomness of the output. A lower value like 0 will make the output more deterministic.\n- `max_tokens`: Limits the number of tokens in the generated response.\n\nThe function then calls the OpenAI API's `ChatCompletion.create()` method to generate a response based on the given messages. The model considers the sequence of messages to understand the context and generate an appropriate reply.\n\nRegarding the delimiter \"####\", how it is used would depend on what the model has been trained to recognize and how the rest of your code processes the model's output. If the model has been trained to recognize \"####\" as a special instruction for handling the messages differently, it will do so. Otherwise, it will treat \"####\" as plain text.\n\nIn your specific example, it seems like the delimiter is used to distinguish between different parts of the system message and the user message. If the model has been trained to recognize this, it will likely generate a response in the same delimited format. Otherwise, you'd have to parse the model's output to extract and process the relevant information based on these delimiters."

However, I don't have access to the OpenAI API to run this code, and the OpenAI API version you mentioned (\"gpt-3.5-turbo\") isn't something I have specific information on, as my training data only goes up until September 2021 and only includes details up to GPT-3.\n\nThat said, here's how this function generally works:\n\n1. **Input**: The function takes the following parameters:\n    - `messages`: A list of dictionaries where each dictionary represents a message from either the system or the user. Each dictionary contains a `role` (either \"system\" or \"user\") and `content` (the content of the message).\n    - `model`: The name of the model to use for the completion. Default is \"gpt-3.5-turbo\".\n    - `temperature`: Controls the randomness of the output. Lower values make the output more deterministic.\n    - `max_tokens`: The maximum number of tokens for the generated message.\n\n2. **API Call**: The function calls `openai.ChatCompletion.create` with the given parameters. This sends the conversation history (`messages`) to the specified model and asks for a completion.\n\n3. **Output**: The function then returns the generated message content from the first choice in the API response.\n\nThe role of the delimiter `####` within the messages is not explicitly handled by this function. Rather, the model that processes the messages would use the delimiter as a contextual cue to understand the structure of the conversation and respond appropriately. The model could recognize that the delimiter separates different sections or steps and generate a response that adheres to the same structure."

                            "Ah, I see. The function `get_completion_from_messages` appears to be a wrapper around OpenAI's API for the GPT-3.5 Turbo model. It takes a list of messages as input, each with a 'role' and 'content', and returns a generated message as the response.\n\nIn this context, the delimiter `####` is more of a convention than a strict requirement imposed by the OpenAI API. It's essentially a string that you've chosen to include in the messages to help with parsing or reading them later. The GPT model itself will treat the delimiter as just another part of the text, but you can use it to programmatically split or organize the text before or after it's processed by the model.\n\nHere's a simplified explanation of what might be happening:\n\n1. The system message includes instructions and uses `####` to separate the steps or sections.\n2. The user message also includes the delimiter `####` before and after the actual message content, which seems like a way to flag the actual query amidst possible additional information.\n3. The `get_completion_from_messages` function sends these messages to the GPT model for a chat-based completion. The GPT model will read the text and generate a message as the output, which is then returned.\n\nThe use of the delimiter is essentially a form of structuring the text to make it easier to interpret, either for humans or for some additional layer of software that might process the GPT model's outputs. It's not something inherently understood by the GPT model; rather, it's a tool you're using to organize the text."

This can be useful for quickly scanning the instructions.\n\n3. **For Consistency**: If both the system and user messages are being processed by the same logic or software, using the same delimiter in both kinds of messages can make the parsing code simpler and more robust.\n\n4. **For Modularity**: If the steps are designed to be potentially reusable or re-orderable components, having a standard delimiter can make it easier to manipulate the instructions programmatically. For example, you could easily concatenate different steps together or remove specific steps without having to worry about the text in between.\n\n5. **For Scripting and Automation**: If these messages are part of a script or automated system, using delimiters can make it easier to break down the message into logical parts, which can then be processed or acted upon individually.\n\n6. **For Training or Machine Learning**: If these messages are used as input to a machine learning model (like the GPT model in your example), the delimiter can help the model learn the structure of the instructions, making it easier for the model to generate appropriate responses.\n\nThe actual reason could be one of these or something else entirely, depending on the specific requirements of your application or workflow."

By including the delimiter after each step in the system message, the system might be instructing the GPT model to use the same delimiter in its output. This would make it easier to parse the output programmatically later on, because the output would follow a structured format, with each part of the response separated by the delimiter.\n\nFor example, if the GPT model follows these instructions, the output might look something like this:\n\n```\nStep 1:#### <step 1 reasoning>\nStep 2:#### <step 2 reasoning>\nStep 3:#### <step 3 reasoning>\nStep 4:#### <step 4 reasoning>\nResponse to user:#### <response to customer>\n```\n\nEach part of the output is clearly separated by `####`, which would allow for easy parsing and extraction of the different parts of the response.\n\nSo in this case, the delimiter is not just a marker for human readability; it's a structural element that helps define the format of the output. This is especially useful if the output is going to be processed by other software components, or if you need to extract specific sections of the output for further use."

It would serve as a guide for structuring the response in a way that aligns with the system's instructions. This would not only make the output easier to read but also easier to parse programmatically, should it be necessary.\n\nHere's an example of how I might format a response based on the given system message and user query:\n\n```\nStep 1:#### The user is asking a question about specific products: BlueWave Chromebook and TechPro Desktop.\nStep 2:#### Both products are in the available list.\nStep 3:#### The user is making an assumption that one product is more expensive than the other.\nStep 4:#### The assumption is true; the TechPro Desktop is more expensive than the BlueWave Chromebook.\nResponse to user:#### The TechPro Desktop is priced at $999.99, while the BlueWave Chromebook is priced at $249.99. So, the TechPro Desktop is $750 more expensive than the BlueWave Chromebook.\n```\n\nBy following this format, I would be adhering to the system's guidelines, making it easier for either humans or software to understand and process each part of the response."

                            "Certainly! The code snippet you've provided is for setting up the OpenAI API key in a Python environment. It uses the `dotenv` library to load environment variables, and the `openai` library to interact with OpenAI's API. Here's a breakdown:\n\n### Import Statements\n- `import os`: Imports the built-in Python `os` module for interacting with the operating system.\n- `import openai`: Imports the `openai` library, which is the Python client for the OpenAI API.\n- `from dotenv import load_dotenv, find_dotenv`: Imports the `load_dotenv` and `find_dotenv` functions from the `dotenv` package.\n\n### Load Environment Variables\n- `_ = load_dotenv(find_dotenv())`: The `find_dotenv` function looks for a `.env` file in your project directory or any of its parent directories. Once it finds the `.env` file, `load_dotenv` reads it and loads the environment variables into the Python environment.\n\n### Set API Key\n- `openai.api_key  = os.environ['OPENAI_API_KEY']`: Retrieves the OpenAI API key from the environment variables and sets it as the API key for the `openai` library.\n\nLet's go through each part:\n\n1. **dotenv**: This is a package that allows you to specify environment variables in a `.env` file in your project. This is particularly useful for keeping sensitive information like API keys out of your codebase.\n\n2. **`find_dotenv()`**: This function searches for the `.env` file starting from the directory where the script is located and going up the directory chain until it finds it.\n\n3. **`load_dotenv()`**: This function takes the path to the `.env` file (found by `find_dotenv()`) and loads its contents into the environment, so you can later access these values using `os.environ`.\n\n4. **`os.environ['OPENAI_API_KEY']`: This reads the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable, which you would have set in your `.env` file.\n\n5. **`openai.api_key = ...`: This sets the API key for the OpenAI library, allowing you to make authenticated requests to the OpenAI API.\n\nIn summary, this code snippet is a common pattern for securely managing API keys and other sensitive information in Python applications. By storing this information in a `.env` file and loading it into the environment at runtime, you can keep sensitive data out of your codebase."

                            "### The `os` Module\n\nThe `os` module in Python provides a way to interface with the underlying operating system. It allows you to interact with the file system, read environment variables, and perform various other operating system-dependent tasks. Here are some common use cases:\n\n1. **File Operations**: Create, remove, and modify directories and files.\n    ```python\n    os.mkdir('new_directory')  # Create a new directory\n    os.rmdir('old_directory')  # Remove an empty directory\n    os.remove('file.txt')      # Remove a file\n    ```\n\n2. **Path Manipulation**: Combine, split, and analyze file paths.\n    ```python\n    os.path.join('folder', 'file.txt')  # Combines to 'folder/file.txt'\n    os.path.split('/folder/file.txt')  # Splits to ('/folder', 'file.txt')\n    ```\n\n3. **Environment Variables**: Access or modify environment variables.\n    ```python\n    os.environ['HOME']  # Get the HOME environment variable\n    ```\n\n4. **Command Execution**: Run shell commands from within Python code.\n    ```python\n    os.system('ls -l')  # Executes 'ls -l' command in the shell\n    ```\n\n5. **Process Information**: Get information about the process and system.\n    ```python\n    os.getpid()  # Get the current process ID\n    os.uname()  # Get information like system name, release, etc. (Unix)\n    ```\n\nThe `os` module is very extensive and includes a variety of functionalities that enable you to interact with the operating system in a platform-independent manner.\n\n### The Underscore `_`\n\nIn the line `_ = load_dotenv(find_dotenv())`, the underscore `_` is used as a throwaway variable, meaning that the value it receives is not going to be used later in the code. The function `load_dotenv()` actually returns a boolean value (`True` or `False`) indicating whether it successfully loaded the environment variables or not.\n\nUsing `_` for such values is a common Pythonic idiom when you need to call a function for its side effects (in this case, loading the environment variables), but you don't care about its return value. This makes it clear to anyone reading the code that the actual return value is intentionally being disregarded."

                            "Yes, that's a good observation! The `os` module in Python provides functionalities that are similar to what you can do in a command prompt or terminal window, but programmatically. Just like you can navigate directories, manipulate files, and set environment variables in a terminal, the `os` module allows you to do these tasks within a Python script.\n\nHere's a quick comparison to illustrate:\n\n| Action                    | Terminal Command      | Python `os` Module Equivalent       |\n|---------------------------|-----------------------|-------------------------------------|\n| List files in a directory | `ls`                  | `os.listdir()`                      |\n| Change directory          | `cd <directory>`      | `os.chdir('<directory>')`           |\n| Get current directory     | `pwd`                 | `os.getcwd()`                       |\n| Create a new directory    | `mkdir <directory>`   | `os.mkdir('<directory>')`           |\n| Remove a directory        | `rmdir <directory>`   | `os.rmdir('<directory>')`           |\n| Remove a file             | `rm <file>`           | `os.remove('<file>')`               |\n| Run a shell command       | `<command>`           | `os.system('<command>')`            |\n| Set environment variable  | `export VAR=value`    | `os.environ['VAR'] = 'value'`       |\n| Get environment variable  | `echo $VAR`           | `os.environ.get('VAR')` or `os.environ['VAR']` |\n\nSo yes, you can think of the `os` module as a way to perform many of the operations you'd normally do in a command prompt or terminal, but within a Python script. This is incredibly useful for automating system tasks, manipulating files and directories, and interacting with the operating system in various ways."

Start slow, perhaps by revisiting some of the songs or exercises that you were comfortable with before the break. This can help reacquaint your fingers with the fretboard and reignite muscle memory. A structured practice routine that includes warm-ups, scales, chords, and song practice can also be beneficial. And remember, it's normal for it to feel a bit awkward at first, but consistency is key to getting back into the groove."

                            "Great to hear you're focusing on exercises like the spider for finger agility. Here are some detailed best practices for consistent practice and picking:\n\n1. **Warm-Up**: Always start your practice with a warm-up to loosen your fingers. Simple chromatic exercises or scales work well.\n\n2. **Metronome Use**: Utilize a metronome to work on your timing and picking consistency. Start slow and gradually increase speed.\n\n3. **Alternate Picking**: This is a cornerstone of good picking technique. Work on exercises that involve both downstrokes and upstrokes to develop a smooth, consistent picking motion.\n\n4. **Palm Muting**: This technique can help control string noise and also improve picking accuracy. Practice with and without it to gain better control.\n\n5. **Isolate Trouble Spots**: If you find a specific passage difficult, isolate it and practice it repeatedly until you can play it smoothly.\n\n6. **String Skipping**: Exercises that involve skipping strings can improve your picking accuracy and help you get used to different string tensions.\n\n7. **Finger Independence**: Continue with exercises like the spider, but also add in hammer-ons, pull-offs, and trills to work on finger strength and independence.\n\n8. **Slow Down**: It's better to play a passage correctly and slowly than to rush through it with mistakes. Slow, deliberate practice is key to improvement.\n\n9. **Scheduled Practice**: Consistency is crucial. Set a daily practice schedule and stick to it. Even 20-30 minutes a day can make a significant difference.\n\n10. **Record and Review**: Periodically record yourself. This can help you identify areas for improvement that you might not notice while playing.\n\n11. **Rest and Recovery**: Don't overlook the importance of giving your fingers and hands time to rest. This can prevent strain and injury, allowing you to practice more consistently in the long run.\n\nBy paying attention to these aspects, you'll build a solid foundation for both fingering and picking consistency."

                            "In women's tennis, scoring is similar to men's tennis. Matches are typically played in a best-of-three sets format. Each set consists of games, and each game is divided into points. \n\nTo win a game, a player must score four points in total, but the scoring system is a bit different. The points are counted as follows:\n\n1. 15 points\n2. 30 points\n3. 40 points\n4. Game point\n\nIf both players have 40 points (referred to as \"40-all\" or \"deuce\"), one player must win two consecutive points to win the game. The first point won after deuce is called \"advantage,\" and if the same player wins the next point, they win the game. If the other player wins the point, it goes back to deuce.\n\nTo win a set, a player must win at least six games, and they must win by a margin of at least two games. If the set reaches a score of 6-6, a tiebreak game is often played to determine the set winner. In a tiebreak, players accumulate points (1, 2, 3, etc.) until one player wins seven points with a margin of at least two.\n\nThe player who wins two sets out of three wins the match. If both players win one set each, a third set (if needed) is played to determine the winner."

                            "Certainly! When working with the OpenAI API, you have several options for using delimiters:\n\n1. **Prompt Engineering**: You can use special characters or text patterns within the prompt to separate different sections or elements.\n\n2. **Completion Settings**: You can specify a `stop_sequence` in the API call to automatically end the completion when a specific string or character is encountered.\n\n3. **Task Instructions**: You can include a delimiter in your instruction to the model to distinguish between different tasks. For instance, \"Task 1: [content] ||| Task 2: [content]\".\n\n4. **Token Count**: Be mindful of the maximum token limit (4096 tokens for GPT-3). Delimiters also consume tokens.\n\n5. **Multiple Prompts**: You can delimit multiple prompts using special characters and then use string manipulation on the output to separate the responses.\n\n6. **Custom Formatting**: You can introduce your own delimiters within the prompt to later parse the model's output more easily.\n\n7. **Temperament and Style**: You can use delimiters to guide the model's tone or writing style by separating instructions from the main prompt.\n\n8. **Data Collection**: For data scraping or tabulation tasks, you can use delimiters like commas, semicolons, or tabs to separate data elements.\n\n9. **Conditional Statements**: Although not strictly delimiters, you can use symbols to indicate conditional logic when you want the model to evaluate options.\n\n10. **Language Support**: Delimiters are not language-specific, but choosing ones that make sense in the context of the target language is advisable.\n\nRules:\n- Ensure delimiters do not conflict with your content.\n- Keep track of token usage, including delimiters.\n- Always test your delimiters to ensure they behave as expected. \n\nThese are some of the ways delimiters can be effectively utilized when working with the OpenAI API."

Liver Cancer: The liver mass itself might be a primary hepatocellular carcinoma, or it could be a metastatic lesion from another primary site.\n  \n2. Hematological Cancers: Low white blood cell counts are often seen in leukemias and lymphomas, which can also affect the liver.\n\n3. Gastrointestinal Cancers: Sometimes cancers from the digestive tract, like colorectal or pancreatic cancer, can metastasize to the liver and affect blood counts.\n\n4. Other Metastatic Cancers: Cancers from other organs like the lung, breast, or kidney can spread to the liver and may be associated with abnormal blood tests.\n\n5. Multiple Myeloma: While less common, this blood cancer can affect both the liver and blood counts.\n\nThese are just examples, and the presence of these symptoms and test results requires a thorough medical evaluation for diagnosis."

However, it's possible for these two findings to coexist for various reasons:\n\n1. Separate Causes: Each parameter could be elevated due to unrelated issues. High B12 might result from supplementation or liver disease, while high MCH could be due to a separate issue like alcohol consumption.\n\n2. Liver Disease: Both high B12 and elevated MCH can occur in liver disease. The liver plays a role in storing B12 and producing proteins that affect red blood cell morphology.\n\n3. Blood Disorders: Certain myelodysplastic syndromes or other bone marrow disorders can cause abnormalities in both B12 levels and red blood cell indices like MCH.\n\n4. Medication: Some medications can affect both B12 levels and MCH.\n\n5. Lab Error: It's also possible, though less likely, that the lab results are inaccurate and need to be repeated.\n\nUnderstanding the reason for these findings usually requires a comprehensive medical evaluation that may include additional tests and imaging studies."

Antimetabolites: Drugs like methotrexate, used in chemotherapy and autoimmune diseases, can affect B12 metabolism and potentially influence MCH.\n  \n2. Antiretroviral Drugs: Some medications used in the treatment of HIV/AIDS may cause changes in blood counts, including MCH, and might also impact B12 levels.\n\n3. Antiepileptics: Medications like phenytoin can interfere with B12 metabolism and may cause hematological changes.\n\n4. Hydroxyurea: This medication is used for conditions like sickle cell disease and can affect red blood cell indices.\n\n5. Immunosuppressants: Medications like azathioprine can impact bone marrow function, affecting both B12 levels and MCH.\n\n6. Proton Pump Inhibitors: Long-term use of these medications can affect B12 absorption but is less likely to affect MCH directly.\n\n7. Diuretics: Some diuretics may interfere with B12 and other nutrient levels, although they're more commonly associated with changes in electrolytes rather than MCH.\n\n8. Nitrous Oxide: While not a medication in the traditional sense, exposure to nitrous oxide can inactivate B12 and potentially lead to hematological changes, including MCH.\n\nIt's essential to consider medication history when interpreting these lab results."

Liver Disease: High B12 and MCH are sometimes seen in liver conditions, which could also potentially affect white blood cell counts.\n\n3. Hematological Disorders: Some bone marrow conditions, like myelodysplastic syndromes or certain leukemias, could result in both elevated monocytes and changes in red blood cell indices, like high MCH.\n\n4. Nutritional Factors: While high B12 would not typically be linked to nutritional deficiencies, other imbalances could affect monocytes and MCH.\n\n5.

While supplements can raise B12 levels, they usually don't elevate them to such a high degree unless the supplement contains extremely high doses and is taken over an extended period. Also, the body typically excretes excess B12 through urine since it's a water-soluble vitamin. However, individual responses to supplements can vary, and factors like kidney function could potentially influence how your body processes and eliminates B12."

                            "I'm glad you're already in touch with healthcare professionals. Let's go through the numbers you've posted:\n\n1. **White Blood Count**: Slightly low at 4.6 K/uL, usually considered below the normal range of 4.8-10.8 K/uL. Low WBC can be indicative of bone marrow issues, chronic infection, or other underlying conditions.\n  \n2. **Red Blood Count, Hemoglobin, and Hematocrit**: All within the normal range, indicating generally healthy red blood cells.\n\n3. **Mean Corpuscular Volume (MCV)**: Also within the normal range, suggesting that red blood cell size is normal.\n\n4. **Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin (MCH)**: Slightly elevated at 31.5 pg, compared to the normal range of 27.0-31.0 pg. High MCH can be indicative of macrocytic anemia, but your other red cell parameters seem normal.\n\n5. **Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin Concentration (MCHC), Red Cell Distribution Width, Platelet Count**: Within normal limits.\n\n6. **Monocytes % (Manual)**: Slightly elevated at 10%, compared to the normal range of 0-9%. Elevated monocytes can be seen in chronic infections, some hematological disorders, and less commonly, certain cancers.\n\n7. **Vitamin B12 Level**: Elevated at 1406 pg/mL, which is higher than the normal range of 193-986 pg/mL. High B12 could be due to supplementation, liver disease, or certain blood cancers.\n\n8. **Tumor Markers (Alpha Fetoprotein, Carcinoembryonic Antigen, CA 19-9)**: All within normal ranges, generally indicating a lower likelihood of certain types of cancer.\n\n9. **Pathologist Comment**: Not shown, but would be important for interpreting especially the blood smear and monocyte levels.\n\nYour labs show a few things that are out of the ordinary: low WBC, slightly high monocytes, high MCH, and notably high Vitamin B12 levels. These anomalies can be related to a variety of conditions, ranging from liver disease, certain infections, to hematological disorders. Given the complexities, these labs should be reviewed in the context of your full medical history, other diagnostic tests, and clinical symptoms for a comprehensive diagnosis."

                            "An unknown liver tumor that's causing pain but appears benign on imaging is still a concerning finding, especially when taken together with the lab results you've shared. Although imaging may suggest a benign lesion, a definitive diagnosis often requires additional steps, such as a biopsy, especially if there are other concerning lab values or symptoms.\n\nPainful liver tumors, even if they appear benign, could potentially be hemangiomas, focal nodular hyperplasia, or hepatocellular adenomas. These are generally benign but can sometimes present with symptoms due to their size or location. On the other hand, more serious conditions like hepatocellular carcinoma (liver cancer) or metastatic cancers from other organs should be ruled out given the complexity of your case.\n\nYour elevated B12 and monocytes, coupled with the slightly low white blood cell count, adds another layer of complexity. While these findings alone are not definitive for any specific condition, they would likely prompt further investigations. \n\nGiven the presence of an unknown liver tumor, and the other lab findings, a multi-disciplinary approach involving a hepatologist, oncologist, and possibly other specialists would be advisable for thorough evaluation and management."

Summarizing all your lab results and clinical findings in one document can indeed be a helpful way to facilitate consistent and comprehensive discussions with your healthcare providers.\n\nHere's how you might summarize your current medical situation based on the labs you've shared:\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Medical Findings as of September 6, 2023\n\n#### Blood Counts:\n\n- **White Blood Count (WBC)**: 4.6 K/uL (Low; normal range 4.8-10.8 K/uL)\n- **Red Blood Count (RBC)**: 5.20 M/uL (Normal; 4.70-6.10 M/uL)\n- **Hemoglobin**: 16.4 g/dL (Normal; 14.0-18.0 g/dL)\n- **Hematocrit**: 48.7% (Normal; 37-52%)\n\n#### Red Blood Cell Indices:\n\n- **Mean Corpuscular Volume (MCV)**: 93.6 fL (Normal; 80-97 fL)\n- **Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin (MCH)**: 31.5 pg (Slightly High; normal range 27.0-31.0 pg)\n  \n#### White Blood Cell Differential:\n\n- **Monocytes % (Manual)**: 10% (Slightly High; normal range 0-9%)\n\n#### Vitamins and Markers:\n\n- **Vitamin B12 Level**: 1406 pg/mL (High; normal range 193-986 pg/mL)\n\n#### Tumor Markers:\n\n- **Alpha Fetoprotein**: 2.6 ng/mL (Normal; <8.4 ng/mL)\n- **Carcinoembryonic Antigen**: 2.3 ng/mL (Normal)\n- **CA 19-9 Antigen**: 18 U/mL (Normal; <35 U/mL)\n\n#### Other Findings:\n\n- Unknown liver tumor that causes pain but appears benign on imaging.\n\n---\n\nGiven the presence of an unknown liver tumor, coupled with the abnormal blood test results including low WBC, slightly high monocytes, and notably high Vitamin B12 levels, a multi-disciplinary approach involving specialists like hepatologists, oncologists, and hematologists is advisable for further evaluation and management.\n\n---\n\nThis summary can act as a starting point for conversations with your healthcare providers. It can help ensure everyone is on the same page and may assist in planning further diagnostic tests and treatment options."

We hope that readers will learn something new about the outstanding people who represent and serve our district community.\\n1. What is your position on the Board? What district do you represent? When did your appointment begin, and when does it end?\\nHi, my name is Tony May and I\u2019m the current Vice President of the Re-2 School board. I was just elected and anticipating an exciting four year term ahead. I live in New Castle and represent District E. The ride never ends.\\n2. Can you tell me about your history in Garfield Re-2? (Ex. How long have you lived here? Do you have kids that go to school in the district? Are you married to an employee?)\\nArriving to the valley 21 years ago, I still consider myself the new guy. I have one daughter and she absolutely enjoys her Re-2 teachers (me too!). My wife Chandelle has taught for the district at Riverside since 1992, she took four and a half years off to stay at home with our daughter after she was born.\\n3. Why did you want to join the Board, and what are the duties of your current role?\\nAs I was exploring the daunting task of running for the Re-2 School Board, I asked a lot of questions to my acquaintances, teachers, board members, tax payers, Mom\u2019s and Dad\u2019s, and to a lot of our district kids. Of course, the overwhelming topics of health were foremost however I had unique feedback from a couple of smart cookies that wanted to have Garfield Re-2 to be known as the best school district in the valley. My bias is that Re-2 is the best. I got thinking of how to take the \u201cBest School District\u201d to the next level and work with other school districts to keep setting the bar even higher. My friends, that\u2019s where the root of my passion lives.\\n4. What were your motivations for serving on the Garfield Re-2 Board of Education?\\nWhat caught my attention one morning at the start of the lockdown, I observed my wife delivering a Riverside Middle School online class from our kitchen table and to my surprise, I witnessed the lack of participation of online students. As I dove deeper into the topic, I automatically started to troubleshoot and quickly realized that a solution was not apparent. I decided to get involved and enthusiastically started attending Re-2 School Board meetings in 2020.\\n5. Who are your role models in terms of leadership and service?\\nMy current favorite Colorado person to follow is Mike Peterson, he is newly elected to the Douglas County School District where e serves as President. He contributes to leadership through experience and professionalism with explicit vision to action. I\u2019m also a follower of President Donald J. Trump and Making America Great Again. I enjoy Canadian Jordan Peterson\u2019s conservative views on culture and political issues. I\u2019ll listen to Joe Rogan sometimes and appreciate how he is evolving as he engages with the spectrum of views.\\n6. Do you have a favorite book, film or quote about education or leadership?\\nMy favorite is the Declaration of Independence. As a family, we read or listen to it every July 4th. Set your calendar with a link, for starters I recommend JFK\u2019s version. As for a favorite book, The Moon Is Down by John Steinbeck. It\u2019s about an invasion of enemy indoctrination and the simple, peaceful people realize their freedom has been taken away by force. There is a villain traitor amongst the town people that aids the enemy. The plot narrates along the enemies will to \\\"to break man's spirit permanently\\\", in contrast to the townspeople\u2019s strong will to resolve the tyranny. I\u2019m currently reading, Old Indian Trails of the Canadian Rockies by Mary Sh\u00e4ffer and The Things They Carried by Tim O\u2019Brien.\\n7. If you're a veteran member, what has been the best part or the hardest part about serving on the board so far? If you're a new member, what are you most looking forward to?\\nMy vision is to provide leadership that will shape our community into the next 25 years. I want to ensure that student achievement is the central focus. Through small steps, I think there is a lot of momentum with computer science with a mountain of resources available to perhaps develop an integrated curriculum path. My vision would create an advisory group to unify competing ideas on computer science instruction and investigate a delivery model. I am also interested in working with the Re-2 administration to further understand the Family Resource Center and liaise ideas from Garfield County Latino Committee, Roaring Fork Schools, D16, D51 and BOCES. I have already taken the initiative to introduce the Latino advocates from Re-1 and Re-2 and talked with D51 on methods they have in place to retain at risk students.\\n8. Did you have a teacher or an educator that made an impact on your life? If so, please tell us about them.\\nMy wife, a sixth grade teacher, loves teaching your kids and it shows by the shear number of past students that constantly approach her to say that she was their favorite teacher. She hasn\u2019t graduated me from sixth grade yet however she says I\u2019m making progress. Mr. Judkins, Asssistant Principle at Miami HS and former Oakland Raider Defensive End, reminded me with three licks that still burn, to not misbehave. Suzanne Freehauf, an NRA instructor, gave me insight on teaching activities that require the utmost respect for safety and the 2nd Amendment. Coach Beggerly, thanks for getting kicked out of a junior varsity basketball game which we were losing, to allow me, as a student manager to step in as coach and lead the team to victory. Mr. Baumert, distinguished Naval Officer and Scoutmaster taught me to persevere and push hard to reach the pinnacle goal of Eagle Scout. My personal motto is: GO TO MECO (Main Engine Cut Off). My favorite day is Monday, see NOFX . Childhood fav was Evel Knievel. Favorite Presidents in order are 45, 16, 1, 26. The Earth is not flat. My most favorite person that I have ever met is my daughter Ellie.\\nGARFIELD SCHOOL DISTRICT NO.

There, some educators argued the standards, crafted by national conservative coalition Civics Alliance, were \u201cChristian, pro-life American,\u201d Colorado Public Radio reported.\\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with American Birthright?\u201d May said. \u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d\\nThe district\u2019s current long-standing social studies curriculum adheres to Colorado state standards, which May said is a \u201cbad fit for our district,\u201d later adding that RE-2 needed to better fill in gaps in the learning process.\\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the end of the world,\u201d May said of possibly adopting the standards. \u201cIn fact it\u2019s very patriotic and very American.\u201d\\nThough specifically adopting a new social studies program has never been an official agenda item during school board meetings, the conversation first emerged during an April 8 board retreat. The public notice for the retreat was called \u201cGoals, Norms, and Strategic Plan,\u201d where the board covered a broad range of topics, the district said on Tuesday.\\nThen, during the last agenda item at June 14\u2019s meeting labeled \u201cFuture Agenda Items,\u201d May suggested the school board hire a consultant to present on the American Birthright Standards. When board members asked to reveal who the consultant was, May chose not to reveal the person\u2019s name.\\nThis, however, immediately triggered more discussion about the Woodland Park School District.\\n\u201cI am very uncomfortable with this person\u2019s agenda,\u201d Re-2 board member Christina Maness said of the unnamed consultant. \u201cIt is one person\u2019s agenda and I want to hear a wide range of views.\u201d\u00a0\\nManess also said the district first needs to discuss its social studies program with curriculum directors before finding it necessary to hire a consultant.\\nIn addition to potentially paying money for a consultant who Maness revealed works with \u201cpublic schools only in extenuating circumstances,\u201d the board discussed other options over its social studies curriculum. This includes possibly remaining with state standards, creating its own new program entirely and more.\\n\u201cIf we write our own standards, that is very different than taking a different set of standards and adopting them and bringing them up to the rigor of the state,\u201d elementary curriculum director Simone Richardson said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have the knowledge base to start from the ground up.\u201d\\nThe board eventually did come to consensus on hearing all options.\\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what this consultant is an expert at or has necessarily done \u2014 I haven\u2019t researched the person,\u201d Board member Britton Fletchall said. \u201cBut I kind of feel that information would be good to have.\u201d\u00a0\\nNo action has been taken on the district\u2019s social studies program. The topic could possibly be addressed during another board retreat slated for Monday.\",\"links\":[{\"title\":\"Roads \\u0026 Weather\",\"link\":\"https://www.postindependent.com/weather/\"},{\"title\":\"The Longevity Project 2023\",\"link\":\"https://www.postindependent.com/the-longevity-project-2023/\"},{\"title\":\"Letter To The Editor\",\"link\":\"https://www.postindependent.com/opinion/letter-to-the-editor/\"}],\"rules\":[\"If an error occured while accessing the link, user can report it at: https://www.webpilot.ai/report-an-issue/\",\"Use the language that the user previously used or the language requested by the user.\",\"Respond to the user's request, which may include asking questions or requesting specific actions (such as translation, rewriting, etc.), based on the provided content.\",\"If the user does not make a request, perform the following tasks: 1.

                            "### Summary\nThe article from Post Independent discusses a proposal made by Tony May, the president of the Garfield Re-2 School Board, to switch the district's current social studies curriculum to a conservative, Christian-based syllabus known as the American Birthright Standards. This proposal has sparked debate within the school board and the community. The American Birthright Standards were previously adopted by the Woodland Park School District in Colorado. Tony May argues that the current curriculum, which adheres to Colorado state standards, is a \"bad fit\" for the district. The proposal was initially discussed during an April 8 board retreat and was further debated in a June 14 meeting where May suggested hiring a consultant to present on the American Birthright Standards. No action has been taken yet, and the topic may be discussed further in future board meetings.\n\n### Thought-Provoking Questions\n1. **Legality and State Standards**: Is it legal for a school district to deviate from state educational standards to adopt a curriculum with a specific ideological focus?\n2. **Community Input**: How important is it for the community to have a say in such significant changes to the educational curriculum?\n3. **Transparency and Decision-Making**: What are the implications of Tony May choosing not to reveal the name of the consultant he suggested for presenting the American Birthright Standards?\n\nWould you like to explore any of these questions further?"

The standards were championed by the district\u2019s new interim superintendent, Ken Witt, a former Jefferson County board president. He\u00a0was recalled along with two other board members in 2015 after they tried to inject patriotism into the history curriculum. \u201cIn all honesty, in my opinion\u2026 the proposed American Birthright standard is better aligned with the Woodland Park School District purpose and core beliefs,\u201d said Witt, who was hired by the board of education on Dec. 21, despite opposition from community members and a student-led petition.\u00a0\u00a0 That statement prompted several loud \u201cno\u2019s\u201d from the audience. At one point the meeting was adjourned after a man yelled out \u201cthis is a joke\u201d and the board president threatened to call the police in the small mountainous community northwest of Colorado Springs. Is Woodland Park now in conflict with the state's standards? Wednesday\u2019s move left members of the Woodland Park RE-2 School District public with many questions about whether this means a fundamental change in how social studies is taught in their district \u2014 and whether the new standards conflict with state standards. All Colorado districts are required to adopt local standards that meet or exceed the state standards.\u00a0 The adoption of the Birthright standards appears to roll back the newly adopted state standards, which call for a more inclusive, robust understanding of American history, civics, and ideals. \u201cDo you believe that adoption of the standards will improve our ability to teach the full, complete, warts and all, history of this country to our students?\u201d board vice-president David Illingworth II asked Witt. Witt said he did, calling American Birthright a \u201cthorough and balanced standard that includes all of the major issues.\u201d\u00a0 He said he consulted with state school board members who backed the Birthright standards to replace Colorado\u2019s social studies standards in December. American Birthright standards are crafted by a national conservative coalition, the Civics Alliance. The standards focus on Western civilization and American exceptionalism and highlight patriotism and Christianity \u2014 and have drawn sharp criticism from teachers and national social studies groups. Critics say the standards are too narrow, presenting a single, glorified narrative of U.S history that minimizes the perspectives of many. The Civics Alliance argues that social studies instruction has been warped, effectively whittling away American liberty. The standards oppose teaching about current events, civic engagement, project-based learning and teaching that promotes diversity, equity and inclusion. In rejecting the standards in December, members of the state school board said they were \u201ctoo extreme\u201d for Colorado and didn\u2019t comply with new state laws requiring that students learn the history, culture, and social contributions of various minority groups as part of their instruction in social studies. New Colorado laws also call for teaching financial and media literacy, as well as Holocaust and genocide studies, which American Birthright standards don\u2019t address. Many parents and students alike are dismayed by the new standards and feel like they were left out of the process. A new conservative school board elected 14 months ago in Woodland Park promised more parents\u2019 rights and changes to counter declining enrollment. But their moves have roiled many in the community, including students who staged protests outside their school. Megan Desmidt, mother of a high school junior, was\u00a0dismayed after reading a Birthright document stating curriculum should ban any form of political activism with no credit for and no encouragement of service-learning, civic engagement, action civics or related activity. \u201cSorry, Kiwanis. Sorry, Scouts. Sorry, Young Republicans. Sorry, student council. This is what you're voting on tonight. This is a big deal.\u201d Audience members questioned why the public or school officials weren\u2019t given a chance to learn about the standards before the board voted on them. \u201cTo me, your process feels rushed and closed off to input,\u201d said district parent Khurshid Rogers. \u201cIf this is something you believe has merit, why not share it and offer people time to become familiar with it and offer feedback?\u201d Rogers asked whether the standards will change what students learn about, whether the district will be in compliance with state standards, and whether parents can opt out of their students learning from the Birthright standards. \u201cIf it will directly impact the content taught to my middle schooler, will you stand by your policies on controversial topics and offer me an opt-in/opt-out opportunity as well as provide alternate learning assignments?\u201d Her questions were not answered. Illingworth said school leaders and the new superintendent will determine whether curriculum or courses will change. \u201cThey are going to assist our educational leaders in developing the curriculum for next year,\u201d he said.\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThis is something the state board is basically forcing our hand on, forcing the school districts and educators all across the state on,\u201d Witt said.\u00a0 \u201cThey're changing standards and everybody's going to have to adapt and react to that. And this is part of that journey.\u201d Ongoing attempts to onboard social studies standards that promote 'patriotism' Witt said the district will review the current curriculum and make determinations. \u201cJust to be clear, this is not dictating curriculum.\u201d Witt, who has a background in technology development and business management, was president of the school board in Jefferson County when he and fellow conservative school board members were recalled in a tumultuous election after two years in office. The recall was sparked after Witt and others passed a resolution stating that AP history classes should promote \\\"patriotism and ... the benefits of the free-enterprise system\\\" and should not \\\"encourage or condone civil disorder.\\\" Critics said they wanted schools to teach a sanitized version of U.S. history that promoted patriotism and downplayed civil rights issues. For weeks, Colorado high school students protested the proposal that the AP history course promotes patriotism. Four high schools closed for a day. The issue became national news. Woodland Park Board president David Rusterholtz addressed the turbulence in the school district by taking to the public microphone during the public comment session Wednesday night. He described his efforts as a \u201cChristian, pro-life American\u201d\u00a0 to bring prayer to the school board meetings. \u201cSome people here would say that this new conservative board of directors has caused this division in our community. I would like to pose once again that it did not cause the division, but it revealed a chasm that already existed.\u201d\",\"extra_search_results\":[{\"title\":\"American Birthright: A Better Standard - \u0421ivics Alliance\",\"link\":\"https://civicsalliance.org/american-birthright-a-better-standard/\",\"snippet\":\"American Birthright's intensive content standards facilitate reliable assessment, whether by national companies such as the Educational Testing Service ...\"},{\"title\":\"American Birthright: The Civics Alliance's Model K-12 Social Studies Standards\",\"link\":\"https://civicsalliance.org/american-birthright/\",\"snippet\":\"American Birthright's intensive content standards fulfill America's promise of equal educational opportunities for everyone.

Civics Alliance is highly critical of the New York Times\u2019 1619 Project, which reframes American history around the consequences of slavery and highlights the contributions of Black Americans. \\nDana Smith, a spokesperson for the Colorado Department of Education, said the department has been in contact with the district, which said it intends to meet or exceed Colorado\u2019s new standards while using the American Birthright curriculum. Local districts have until fall 2024 to either adopt the new Colorado Academic Standards for social studies or their own that meet or exceed these standards.\u00a0\\n \\n \\n\\tGET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX\\n \\n \\n\\t\\nThe Colorado Constitution prohibits the State Board of Education from prescribing curriculums, Smith said. But local districts can add additional content to their curriculums as long as they include the content and grade-level objectives outlined in the state standards.\\nThe Board of Education finished its work on new inclusive social studies standards last year, and the American Birthright standards were rejected at the state level after being proposed by Republican board members. The standards are \u201ctoo extreme for the state of Colorado,\u201d board member Lisa Esc\u00e1rcega said, according to Chalkbeat Colorado. The board removed some language around LGBTQ topics, race and other diversity issues in its final standards after being rejected by multiple Republican board members.\u00a0\\nWoodland Park school officials did not respond to repeated requests from Newsline for comment on how the district plans to implement American Birthright while meeting state standards, but Smith said the district told the department it intends to \u201creview, select and potentially develop instructional materials to use in the classroom\u201d in conjunction with American Birthright.\\n\u201cThis curriculum guidance, along with our additional district requirements for education on the Holocaust and Financial Literacy, will ensure our curriculum meets or exceeds state standards,\u201d the district told the Department of Education.\u00a0\\n Feeling overwhelmed\\n\\t\\nNate Owen, president of the Woodland Park Education Association teachers\u2019 union, said many social studies teachers within the district are concerned about how well students will be prepared for their future under the American Birthright standards. He also said the districts\u2019 social studies teachers were not at all included in the school board\u2019s decision-making process around the standards.\u00a0\\nWoodland Park\u2019s social studies teachers will have a lot of work ahead of them as they try to bring their courses into compliance with both the American Birthright standards and the new Colorado Academic Standards, Owen said, adding that there\u2019s fear around how much more content the social studies teachers will need to meet the state\u2019s standards, and some are feeling overwhelmed.\\n\u201cThey have chosen this profession of social studies teacher that they feel is a very strong calling for them, where they have a lot of passion and they want to make sure they\u2019re teaching correctly,\u201d Owen said. \u201cWe just need to make sure that our students are able to move forward with the best skill set and the best knowledge that they can possibly have so they can be prepared for their own futures.\u201d\\nBut Owen said he\u2019s concerned that more challenges to non-social studies course materials will pop up in the name of American Birthright despite it only applying to social studies. For example, the Gazette reported that the school district removed a book from an English course after complaints that it didn\u2019t align with American Birthright standards and had teachings related to critical race theory. And the district technically isn\u2019t using these standards until next school year.\u00a0\\n\u201cOne of the premises of the reasons why they chose to do that was because of the American Birthright standards, and so I\u2019m hearing conflicting information between moving that to the 2023-24 school year versus what we\u2019re currently doing,\u201d Owen said.\u00a0\\n\\t\\n\\tWe want everyone to adopt it, we\u2019re working on it all the time ... I think it will work well for Colorado school districts to adopt it.\\n\\t\u2013 David Randall, executive director of Civics Alliance\\n\\t\\n\\t\\nDavid Randall, executive director of Civics Alliance, which created the American Birthright standards, said that while Woodland Park is currently the only school district in Colorado to adopt them, he\u2019d like to see more districts follow suit. He said it is \u201cperfectly doable\u201d to implement the American Birthright standards and still meet Colorado\u2019s Academic Standards.\u00a0\\n\u201cWe want everyone to adopt it, we\u2019re working on it all the time,\u201d Randall said. \u201cI think it will work well for Colorado school districts to adopt it.\u201d\\nSeveral social studies courses in the district\u2019s course description guides for the 2023-24 school year no longer have National Collegiate Athletic Association approval under the American Birthright\u2019s guidelines, while those same courses were previously approved under the 2022-23 school year. This means students who take these courses starting next school year cannot count them as core courses when seeking NCAA eligibility, while previously they could.\u00a0\\n \\n \\n \\n\\t\\n \\n \\n Our stories may be republished online or in print under Creative Commons license CC BY-NC-ND 4.0.

                            "Certainly. The article discusses the adoption of the American Birthright Standards by the Woodland Park School District in Colorado. Despite the Colorado Board of Education adopting new inclusive social studies standards, this particular district has chosen to use the conservative American Birthright standards. These standards are designed by the New York-based conservative coalition Civics Alliance.\n\nThe article highlights that local districts in Colorado have until fall 2024 to adopt new academic standards for social studies that meet or exceed the state's standards. The Woodland Park School District intends to meet these state standards while also implementing the American Birthright curriculum.\n\nThe article also touches on concerns from social studies teachers within the district. They are worried about how well students will be prepared for their future under these new standards. Additionally, the article mentions that some social studies courses in the district no longer have National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) approval under the American Birthright guidelines, affecting students seeking NCAA eligibility.\n\nWould you like to delve into any specific aspect of the article?"

How about Silt? Maybe New Castle? Or, my favorite white supremacist hang out: Rifle?\\nI used to go to Lauren Boebert\u2019s Shooter\u2019s Grill from time to time when I wanted a cold beer and a burger, and they were not too bad either! I never saw Lauren Boebert there in person, but did see two Hispanic cooks in the kitchen who came out in the late afternoon for cold soda near the bar.\u00a0\u00a0\\nThey spoke fluent Spanish. Nobody paid attention to them.\\nIn Aspen, hotels like Hotel Jerome, and so many others in Snowmass hire a lot of Hispanic people to work for them between Nov. 1 of every year to May 1. They work a lot of double shifts, and make enough money from tips alone to allow them to not work for the rest of the year if they choose not to. The reason I know this is because between 2012 to 2018 I was one of those commuters to Aspen.\\nHousing is next to impossible to acquire in and around Glenwood Springs. I had a friend who lived full time in Grand Junction and drove to Aspen 5-6 days a week for work. I asked her why she did that? According to her the pay was so much better in Aspen, it made sense for her to commute.\\nWhen I lived in West Glenwood Springs for those years, my next door neighbor was from Honduras legally with a green card. She cleaned houses in Aspen, and she told me she had so much work that if she wanted to, she could work 7 days per week, 12 hours per day. She told me her clients said no white people ever reached out to her or her friends to clean their houses. So the Hispanic women went to work 55 miles up the mountain who lived in Glenwood.\\nWithout the Aspen tourists in the summer as well as the wintertime, Glenwood would not be such a nice place. The rent is already outrageous from Aspen all the way to Parachute, and house prices?\\nInsane.\u00a0\u00a0\\nMy family owns a house in Texas that is 2,700 square feet with a yard on one third of an acre,\u00a0 completely redone top to bottom. They paid $179,000 for it three years ago.\u00a0\u00a0\\nThat house in Glenwood would sell for $600,000 to\u00a0 $700,000, easily. Why? Greed.\\nWithout those essential workers at hotels in Aspen, like cooks, valets, maids, those hotels would close. Glenwood would dry up and blow away?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\\nWelcome those essential workers, folks, because without them the Glenwood economy would suffer. Racism in Glenwood Springs? Sort of. That language is spoken in hushed tones in bars and restaurants, but not out loud. Rifle? White supremacists meet weekly. The police know who they are, but do not seem to care much.\\nAmerica is still coming to grips with their racism. Eventually, they will get it right.\\nSteve Gluckman, Glenwood Springs\\nHalf the loaf\\nSome friends had a wonderful time enjoying music in Basalt\u2019s new River Park. It was a big turnout. Families brought children. Children, and even adults, were taking off their shoes for the delicious feeling of grass on their bare feet. Afterwards, people walked into Old Town for drinks and food. It\u2019s what some hoped for eight years past when the battle ensued over replacing the Pan and Fork Mobile Home Park. The battle was drawn between the developers and the community-minded. Growth, always growth, was opposed to a priceless community resource that is a central park at the confluence of two rivers. The festivities vindicated those who fought for the public space. They got half the loaf. They should get hero medals.\\nPatrick Hunter, Carbondale\\nOn American Birthright\\nAs usual, the Post Independent skews the news to the left, calling the American Birthright curriculum conservative, when actually the proposed curriculum by the Colorado Board of education is far left \u201cprogressive.\u201d Only ONE person in 20 spoke in favor of it yet that is the person the post gave the most print to. Nearly all the other speakers were in support of a more traditional, less ideological driven curriculum.\\nBefore the knee jerk supporters of the \u201cexperts\u201d at Colorado BOE jump into this \u2014 READ the American Birthright curriculum before commenting.\\nAlso the majority at the meeting is AGAINST the social justice activist type of education, called indoctrination by many. Keep it up with the provably harmful revisionism happening in education and watch a continued exodus to home schooling and alternatives as the parents rebel against politicizing their children, and go against child developmental growth. This increase in educational overreach that disrespects parents, ALL students and an imbalance in presenting history from a relativistic revisionist view, loses much of the span of the ugly, and the inspiring, to learn from.\\nSky Quarto, Carbondale\\nLibraries and certain books\\nThis letter is in response to Trish O\u2019Grady\u2019s letter to the editor titled \u201cRevoke this Book,\u201d published Aug. 9, 2023. I am a conservative voter who voted yes to more money for our libraries in our last election. I\u2019m appalled at what I am now becoming aware of. The library has always, in my opinion, been a safe wholesome place for children and young adults to visit. Parents beware. They are grooming your youngsters. When did porn creep into our public libraries? When did it change? Our schools and our library have the ability to change our culture. If we let them. Anything that has a parental advisory warning should not be freely handed out to under age youth. The books that I\u2019m speaking about have a red dot on the spine identifying them as explicit. They aren\u2019t just sexual but violently so. There isn\u2019t much of a story line, just cartoonish pornographic violent depictions of explicit scenarios. They are rubbish.\\nIn the U.S., child trafficking is aggravated by four main factors: the porous southern border, predatory social media use, pornography and broken families. Quoted from Emma Waters. If you haven\u2019t seen \u201cSound of Freedom,\u201d please go and see that movie. Open your eyes and ears to what is happening. Our children are our future.\u00a0\\nWhat future do we have if their lives are ruined? Our children need to be innocent, not groomed.

The Civics Alliance recently published American Birthright: The Civics Alliance's Model K-12 Social Studies Standards. NCSS has a clear position statement on the best practices when developing social studies standards. Using the best practices outlined in that 2021 position statement, NCSS has determined that the suggested social studies standards developed by the Civics Alliance do not align with best practices related to the development of social studies standards. If implemented in schools, these suggested standards would have damaging and lasting effects on the civic knowledge of students and their capacity to engage in civic reasoning and deliberation. NCSS does not endorse nor support the use of these standards.\\nIn making this determination, NCSS relied upon its 102 years of experience in supporting the teaching and learning of social studies. Our position has remained consistent over the years that the standards that organizations, states, districts, and/or schools and teachers develop or adopt should be grounded in current scholarship, reflect best practices in social studies education, and be inclusive for all student backgrounds and ability levels. Although the Civics Alliance claims that its standards align with these expectations, they do not. Rather, we view these suggested standards as an attempt to return to a time when United States social studies classrooms presented a single narrative of U.S. and Western history that glorified selected aspects of history while minimizing the experiences, contributions, and perspectives of Indigenous peoples, people of color, women, the LGBTQIA+ community, the working class, and countless others. The writers of the suggested standards use outdated language, have a clear political motive, and promote content and approaches to social studies and history education that do not align with those recommended by experts in social studies content areas.\u00a0\\nIn addition, NCSS takes issue with the Civics Alliance\u2019s characterization of the College, Career, and Civic Life (C3) Framework as a document that promotes generic reading skills and rejects the learning of content. The C3 Framework is grounded in disciplinary literacy skills that help students learn how to read, write, and think like historians, geographers, economists, and political and social scientists. These skills are rigorous and extend far beyond generic reading skills. The C3 Framework, by design, focuses on best practices in social studies pedagogy that can be applied to build meaningful learning of any content standards. Furthermore, the C3 Framework, as clearly explained in the introduction, \u201c... does not include all that can or should be included in a set of robust social studies standards, and intentionally preserves the critical choices around the selection of curricular content taught at each grade level as a decision best made by each state.\u201d\\nAs organizations, states, districts, and/or schools and teachers develop or adopt social studies standards, NCSS supports the following documents as powerful guidelines to inform the development of social studies standards at the state and local level, and we recommend that these documents be used to center standards-development and adoption work:\\nNational Curriculum Standards for Social Studies: A Framework for Teaching, Learning, and Assessment\\nThe C3 (College, Career, and Civic Life) Framework for Social Studies State Standards\\nEducating for American Democracy (EAD) Roadmap (for United States history and government standards)\\nFor more information on the principles that the National Council for the Social Studies promotes related to social studies standards development, please see our statement found here.\\n\u00a0\\nThe mission of National Council for the Social Studies is to advocate and build capacity for high-quality social studies by providing leadership, services, and support to educators.\\n8555 16th St, Suite 500 \u2022 Silver Spring, MD 20910\\n \\nFooter menu\\nAd Choices\\n \\nAdvertise\\n \\nContact Us\\n \\nPrivacy Policy\\n \\nSite Map\\nweb design \\u0026 development by new target, inc.\\nTweet\",\"extra_search_results\":[{\"title\":\"An Exploration of Birthright Citizenship\",\"link\":\"http://lawblogs.uc.edu/ihrlr/2021/12/20/an-exploration-of-birthright-citizenship/\",\"snippet\":\"\"},{\"title\":\"American Birthright: The Civics Alliance's Model K-12 Social \u2026\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63a2\u7d22\",\"link\":\"https://civicsalliance.org/american-birthright/\",\"snippet\":\"\"},{\"title\":\"Right wing's new social studies plan 'American \u2026\",\"link\":\"https://www.rawstory.com/american-birthright/\",\"snippet\":\"\"}],\"links\":[{\"title\":\"NCSS in the News\",\"link\":\"https://www.socialstudies.org/about/ncss-news\"},{\"title\":\"NCSS House of Delegates\",\"link\":\"https://www.socialstudies.org/about/ncss-house-delegates\"},{\"title\":\"NCSS Seal of Civic Readiness Toolkit\",\"link\":\"https://www.socialstudies.org/advocacy/ncss-seal-civic-readiness-toolkit\"}],\"rules\":[\"If an error occured while accessing the link, user can report it at: https://www.webpilot.ai/report-an-issue/\",\"Use the language that the user previously used or the language requested by the user.\",\"Respond to the user's request, which may include asking questions or requesting specific actions (such as translation, rewriting, etc.), based on the provided content.\",\"If the user does not make a request, perform the following tasks: 1.

These standards, entitled \\\"American Birthright,\\\" are framed as yet another corrective to supposedly \\\"woke\\\" public schools, where, according to Republicans, theoretical frameworks like critical race theory are only one part of a larger attack on the foundations of American democracy.\u00a0\\n\\\"Too many Americans have emerged from our schools ignorant of America's history, indifferent to liberty, filled with animus against their ancestors and their fellow Americans, and estranged from their country,\\\" reads the introduction to \\\"American Birthright.\\\" (The \\\"birthright\\\" here refers to \\\"freedom.\\\") And the fields of history and civics, it suggests, exemplify the worst of that trend. \\\"The warping of American social studies instruction has created a corps of activists dedicated to the overthrow of America and its freedoms, larger numbers of Americans indifferent to the steady whittling away of American liberty, and many more who are so ignorant of the past they cannot use our heritage of freedom to judge contemporary debates.\\\"\u00a0\\nRELATED:\u00a0School's out forever: Arizona moves \\\"to kill public education\\\" with new universal voucher law\\nWhile it claims to represent an ideologically neutral, apolitical history, the document holds that most instruction that references \\\"diversity, equity and inclusion\\\" or \\\"social justice\\\" amounts to \\\"vocational training in progressive activism\\\" and \\\"actively promote[s] disaffection from our country.\\\" It heralds Ronald Reagan as a \\\"hero of liberty\\\" alongside Abraham Lincoln and Martin Luther King Jr. Its proposed lessons in contemporary U.S. history include Reagan's revitalization of the conservative movement, Bill Clinton's impeachment, \\\"Executive amnesties for illegal aliens\\\" and the \\\"George Floyd Riots.\\\"\u00a0\u00a0\\nAmerican Birthright is just one of numerous recent right-wing efforts to overhaul public K-12 curricula to align with the dictates of current conservative ideology.\u00a0\\nLast week, the Miami Herald reported that Florida's Department of Education has begun holding three-day training sessions for public school teachers around the state to prepare them to implement the state's new Civics Literacy Excellence Initiative, Gov. Ron DeSantis' flagship effort to create a more \\\"patriotic\\\" civics curriculum. The new Florida standards were created in consultation with Hillsdale College, a small Christian college that has become a guiding force on the right, and the Charles Koch-founded Bill of Rights Institute.\u00a0\\nSome Florida teachers say the state's new standards promote a \\\"Christian fundamentalist\\\" understanding of history, and that trainers had told them the founding fathers opposed the separation of church and state.\\nAs the Herald reported, a number of teachers who attended the first training, in Broward County, emerged with deep concerns. Some said the new civics standards appeared to promote \\\"a very strong Christian fundamentalist way\\\" of analyzing U.S. history. Others recounted that trainers had claimed that America's founding fathers opposed strict separation of church and state, had compared the end of school-sponsored prayer to segregation and had downplayed the history of American slavery in misleading ways. (Slides from the training presentation noted that enslaved people in the U.S. only accounted for 4% of the trans-Atlantic slave trade, which both minimizes the number of people ultimately enslaved in America and suggests that other countries' slavery practices were worse.)\\nAlso last week, the Texas Tribune reported that a group of advisers to the state's education board \u2014 which is adapting its own social studies standards after Texas' legislature banned teaching about racism or slavery in ways that make students \\\"feel discomfort\\\" \u2014 had proposed that second-grade teachers call slavery \\\"involuntary relocation.\\\" (After a board member objected, the board voted to \\\"revisit\\\" that language.)\u00a0\\nCurrently, a number of conservative activists and media figures are campaigning against the Civics Secures Democracy Act, a bipartisan bill recently reintroduced in the U.S. Senate that would provide funding for civics education research and programming. In multiple articles calling on conservatives to oppose the bill, the Civics Alliance charged that the bill would \\\"transform civics education, injecting identity politics into K-12 classrooms around the country\\\" and divide \\\"Americans into mutually hostile factions.\\\" The National Review called the bill a trap that would open \\\"the door to the nationalization of CRT.\\\" And last week, DeSantis charged that the bill was an attempt to \\\"buy off states with $6 billion if they sacrifice American History for Critical Race Theory and Biden's other political whims of the day.\\\"\u00a0\\nBut even in this climate, \\\"American Birthright\\\" seeks to distinguish itself through the scope of its ambitions. The document is not a curriculum but rather a model set of social studies standards, of the sort that state-level education departments adopt in order to guide and regulate individual school districts as they craft their own curricula.\u00a0\\nThat's by design. Civics Alliance describes its mission as \\\"preserving and improving America's civics education and preventing the subordination of civics education to political recruitment tools,\\\" namely by writing model bills and social studies standards that lawmakers and activists can use to influence the curricula schools and school districts create.\u00a0\\nWant a daily wrap-up of all the news and commentary Salon has to offer? Subscribe to our morning newsletter, Crash Course.\\nAs the document explains, \\\"We chose this form because state standards are the single most influential documents in America's education administrations.\\\" Not only do such standards have significant impact on public school curricula, they also affect those of AP courses, charter schools, private schools, homeschooling and textbooks used across the country. \\\"American Birthright's\\\" authors charge that \\\"far too many\\\" state education departments \\\"are set on imposing state social studies standards that combine...the worst of misguided pedagogical theory with the worst of anti-American animus.\\\" So Civics Alliance is effectively bypassing them, taking their pitch directly to state governors, lawmakers and school boards, as well as grassroots activists who can pressure politicians to deploy the new standards.\u00a0\\n*\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\\nThe Civics Alliance was created in 2021 as an offshoot of another entity, the National Association of Scholars, a conservative nonprofit aimed at reforming higher education which features right-wing leaders like Ginni Thomas (the suddenly-famous spouse of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas) on its board. NAS launched Civics Alliance after Joe Biden closed down the 1776 Commission \u2014 Donald Trump's answer to the \\\"1619 Project\\\" \u2014 on his first day in office. In fact, the Civics Alliance seems to have consciously taken up the 1776 Commission's professed mission. In \\\"American Birthright,\\\" the authors insist they aren't seeking to create a uniform national curriculum, but cite the 1776 Curriculum \u2014 published in 2021 by Hillsdale College, from which two leading members of Trump's commission were drawn \u2014 as aligned with their vision, along with the curricula of Great Hearts Academies, a \\\"classical education\\\" network, and the Black conservative group 1776 Unites.\\nToo many education officials, the authors claim, \\\"combine the worst of misguided pedagogical theory with the worst of anti-American animus.\\\"\\nNAS and its leaders have involved themselves in numerous contemporary education controversies. In 2018, Civics Alliance executive director David Randall took aim at Massachusetts education authorities after they revised the state's social science standards. In a report with the Pioneer Institute, \\\"No Longer a City on a Hill,\\\" Randall charged that the new standards were \\\"an exercise in progressive educational propaganda and vocational training for how to be a political activist\\\" (a charge echoed nearly verbatim in \\\"American Birthright\\\"). As evidence, Randall wrote that the standards had subordinated the \\\"Founding era\\\" to the civil rights movement, used \\\"politically correct vocabulary\\\" such as \\\"Native American\\\" rather than \\\"Indian,\\\" noted that the Industrial Revolution had resulted in wealth inequality, and failed to recommend texts from right-wing icons like Phyllis Schlafly (on women's rights) or Justice Antonin Scalia (on gun control).\\nThis April, NAS released a brief warning conservatives that \\\"social emotional learning\\\" \u2014 at its most basic, a term for teaching students to regulate their emotions and play well with classmates \u2014 had been reoriented \\\"toward teaching a radical political agenda and promoting student activism,\\\" particularly around race. The Civics Alliance announced a corresponding initiative to build a network of state affiliates \\\"dedicated to removing\\\" SEL \\\"action civics\\\" from their states. DeSantis' administration subsequently cited the use of SEL concepts as justification for rejecting nearly half of the math textbooks submitted to it for consideration by Florida schools.\\nThis February, when NAS released a study ranking 15 different K-12 civics curricula, both the 1776 Curriculum and 1776 Unites received high scores, as did Florida's new civics standards; NAS gave the \\\"1619 Project,\\\" predictably, an \\\"F.\\\" In a podcast interview last week marking the release of the standards, Randall said that he saw \\\"American Birthright\\\" as the sort of work Trump's 1776 Commission might have created, had it continued. Indeed, a number of the same figures were involved in both.\u00a0\\nThe list of groups and individuals involved in the creation of \\\"American Birthright\\\" reads like a who's-who of U.S. right-wing policy advocacy, including think tanks like the Claremont Institute, the Family Research Council and the creationist Discovery Institute, and influential state groups such as Arizona's Goldwater Institute and Massachusetts' Pioneer Institute. The document gives prominent credit to Florida's Department of Education, and its 2021 revised civics standards, and lists a department official among its expert consultants.\u00a0\\nOther coauthors, consultants and board members have played prominent roles in education stories Salon has tracked in recent months. There is Mari Barke, a California education board member and staffer at the right-wing California Policy Center, whose husband runs one of Hillsdale College's charter schools. There is Richard Lowery, a University of Texas-Austin professor who helped propose a right-wing institute on the UT campus that Texas Republicans see as an antidote to CRT. There is anti-CRT activist Christopher Rufo, architect of the right's education agenda for the last two years, as well as people like Parental Rights Foundation president William Estrada, Moms for Liberty cofounder Tiffany Justice, right-wing direct mail pioneer Richard Viguerie and multiple staffers associated with Hillsdale College and Schlafly's Eagle Forum.\u00a0\\nMore importantly, there are more than 20 state lawmakers and elected officials credited with helping create the standards, including, most prominently, North Carolina Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson. Also listed is Arizona state Rep. Shawnna Bolick, wife of Arizona Supreme Court Justice Clint Bolick, who, as Salon reported last week, has been a leading figure in school privatization efforts.\\n*\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\\n\\\"American Birthright\\\" has yet to receive much attention from the mainstream press, but among conservative think tanks and media, it's been heralded as the way forward, often by figures involved in its creation. City Journal, the publication of the Manhattan Institute, cheered the standards as a \\\"Return to Lincoln.\\\" Wisconsin's MacIver Institute asserted that American Birthright \\\"doesn't train students to protest\\\" but rather \\\"to be students of history.\\\" The Federalist Society declared, \\\"Here's what your child's school should be teaching about American history and government.\\\" David Randall himself wrote that the standards were necessary because, \\\"If education reformers don't act now, Woke social studies standards will teach a slanderous caricature of our history that prepares students to work to replace our republic with an illiberal regime.\\\"\u00a0\\nSome of the claims made to bolster American Birthright have been misleading, as when the Bluegrass Institute for Public Policy Solutions \u2014 another member of the coalition behind the document \u2014 suggested that Kentucky's current standards mean students don't learn about figures like Ben Franklin or Abraham Lincoln.\u00a0\\n\\\"Woke social studies standards,\\\" warns David Randall, \\\"teach a slanderous caricature of our history\\\" that could lead to replacing \\\"our republic with an illiberal regime.\\\"\\nThat's far from accurate, said Sarah Shear, a professor of social studies and multicultural education at the University of Washington-Bothell and coauthor of two national studies assessing state K-12 standards on U.S. history, civics and government. Most state standards are streamlined by necessity, says Shear, and the absence of individual figures from general standards doesn't mean they aren't taught.\u00a0\\n\\\"I read every state's standards, cover to cover,\\\" said Shear. \\\"And I'm just perplexed at the notion that the state standards are in any way radically left.\\\"\\nWhat some have done, Shear continued, is open standards to more accurate and complex representations of history. \\\"How does that threaten us as a nation, to know more and think more deeply about history, whether it's Washington, Lincoln, the Constitution or the American Revolution?\\\" she asked. \\\"When we peel back the layers and reveal a much more detailed story of how the United States became a country, it's not a story that includes everyone having freedom and democracy from the word go. That's just not what happened here.\\\"\\n\\\"I often hear from people that telling the truth threatens the pretty story of the country we live in,\\\" she continued. \\\"But not telling the truth has harmed everyone, because it has not provided the capacity by which we could address the problems we still have.\\\"\u00a0\\nChristopher Martell, a social studies education professor at the University of Massachusetts-Boston who wrote a Twitter\u00a0thread about \\\"American Birthright\\\" last week, says another problem with the model standards is how they provide fixed answers to questions that social studies classrooms are meant to debate, such as the role of the free market or how to balance questions of religious freedom.\u00a0\\nMartell said he was particularly concerned about \\\"a clear undertone\\\" in American Birthright suggesting \\\"that the U.S. is a Christian nation founded on Christian values and beliefs,\\\" exemplified by passages calling for curricula to emphasize \\\"the role of faith in sustaining and extending liberty\\\" and describing America's founding principles as \\\"rooted in Christian thought.\\\"\u00a0\\nLikewise, Martell pointed to the standards' ubiquitous emphasis on Western civilization, evident in the document's statement that \\\"America's ideas of freedom\\\" come from \\\"the long history of Western civilization\\\" but also in the way both U.S. and European history, which are covered in depth, are contrasted with \\\"world history.\\\"\u00a0\\nWhile \\\"American Birthright\\\" presents Western civilization as a rich intellectual legacy that includes the creation of science and democracy, the non-European world is largely covered as the study of \\\"migrations, clashes, massacres [and] conquests\\\" undertaken by \\\"small-scale tribes, nomadic societies, and villages that preceded civilization, whose warlike nature must be understood in order to comprehend the character and the magnitude of the civilizing process.\\\"\u00a0\\n\\\"To me, that is like trying to embed white supremacy in the standards without saying, 'This is the white supremacy curriculum,'\\\" said Martell. \\\"It sends a message that Western society is civilization, and the rest of the world is not.\\\"\u00a0\\n*\u00a0 *\u00a0 *\\nMuch of \\\"American Birthright\\\" reflects recent education fights. For example, the document calls on the federal government to \\\"withdraw from regulating or funding any aspect of K-12 education,\\\" to pass legislation prohibiting \\\"discriminatory pedagogies and action civics\\\" (read: CRT and SEL), to require that high school studies classes teach \\\"Western civilization\\\" and that all academic standards be approved by state governors and legislatures, and to reform teaching licensure so as to \\\"end the gatekeeping power of the education schools and departments.\\\"\u00a0\\nThat last point in particular has featured in several recent attacks on public education. In an April speech at Hillsdale College, Christopher Rufo called for state lawmakers to rescind requirements that teachers must hold education degrees and forecast a future when teachers with masters degrees will be shunned by hiring committees, who would correctly see such credentials as signs of radical left-wing politics. Just last week, journalist Phil Williams at Tennessee's NewsChannel 5 reported on secret recordings of Hillsdale president Larry Arnn disparaging public school teachers as having been \\\"trained in the dumbest parts of the dumbest colleges in the country,\\\" during a private event with Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee, who is rolling out Hillsdale programs across the state.\\nSimilar to last week's controversy around Florida's civics training, which many participants felt minimized U.S. slavery, \\\"American Birthright\\\" instructs curriculum makers to teach that many more enslaved Africans were transported to Latin America or the Caribbean than the U.S. and suggests comparing U.S. slavery to \\\"different forced-labor regimes, including Muslim slavery, Eastern Europe's Second Serfdom, African slavery [and] American Indian slavery.\\\" The standards also suggest that 19th-century European imperialism should be taught as a boon to colonized people, accounting for \\\"Improved life expectancy and growing populations among colonized peoples\\\" as well as the \\\"Abolitions of slavery.\\\"\u00a0\\nNeither Martell nor Shear see realistic prospects that \\\"American Birthright\\\" will find a broad reception, either at the national level or among individual teachers. Both worried, however, that the standards could find a path to influence through conservative state lawmakers, as Civics Alliance itself clearly hopes.\u00a0\\n\\\"I imagine a bunch of conservative politicians handing this to state education agencies and saying, 'We need to use this document to write our framework,'\\\" said Martell. \\\"Then teachers will have to address the framework when they are observed by their principals or when they talk about lesson planning with their departments.\\\"\u00a0\\nSome states, such as Illinois, make standards decisions at the local level, said Shear, meaning conservative activists might also lobby to get something like \\\"American Birthright\\\" introduced locally.\u00a0\\n\\\"It always comes down to who gets to control the narrative of whose experiences and whose voices matter,\\\" said Shear. \\\"When I see standards like Florida's, or this 'Birthright' curriculum, it's very much seeking a return to the narrative that privileges a particular identity and does not tell the entirety of the truth of what the United States has been in the past, is right now, or should be in the future. And that's very worrisome to me.\\\"\u00a0\\n\\\"There's a long game with what they're doing here. There was a long game to overturn Roe v. Wade, and I think they're doing that with education as well,\\\" said Martell. \\\"Twenty or 30 years ago, I couldn't have imagined a neoconservative, Christian-influenced civics workshop for teachers being pushed by the state.\\\" Now, he said, in Florida and beyond, that's here.\u00a0\\nRead more from Kathryn Joyce on the right's campaign against public education:\\nBetsy DeVos and Ron DeSantis: GOP dynamic duo team up to defund public schools\\nThe guy who brought us CRT panic offers a new far-right agenda: Destroy public education\\nSalon investigates: The war on public schools is being fought from Hillsdale College\",\"extra_search_results\":[{\"title\":\"American Birthright Standard still an option for Garfield Re-2 | PostIndependent.com\",\"link\":\"https://www.postindependent.com/news/american-birthright-standard-still-an-option-for-garfield-re-2/\",\"snippet\":\"Following a four-hour discussion, Garfield Re-2 School board on Wednesday voted to review options for setting its social studies standards.\"},{\"title\":\"[PDF] The Civics Alliance's Model K-12 Social Studies Standards - BoardDocs\",\"link\":\"https://go.boarddocs.com/co/cde/Board.nsf/files/CJVJZK4F58FB/$file/AmericanBirthright.pdf\",\"snippet\":\"The Civics Alliance, a coalition of organizations and individuals dedicated to improving America's civics education, created American Birthright as a model ...\"},{\"title\":\"American Birthright: The Civics Alliance's Model K-12 Social Studies Standards\",\"link\":\"https://civicsalliance.org/american-birthright/\",\"snippet\":\"American Birthright teaches students to identify the ideals, institutions, and individual examples of human liberty, individualism, religious freedom, and ...\"}],\"links\":[{\"title\":\"News \\u0026 Politics\",\"link\":\"https://www.salon.com/category/news-and-politics\"},{\"title\":\"Science \\u0026 Health\",\"link\":\"https://www.salon.com/category/science-and-health\"},{\"title\":\"School's out forever: Arizona moves \\\"to kill public education\\\" with new universal voucher law\",\"link\":\"https://www.salon.com/2022/07/01/schools-out-forever-arizona-moves-to-public-education-with-new-universal-voucher-law/\"}],\"rules\":[\"If an error occured while accessing the link, user can report it at: https://www.webpilot.ai/report-an-issue/\",\"Use the language that the user previously used or the language requested by the user.\",\"Respond to the user's request, which may include asking questions or requesting specific actions (such as translation, rewriting, etc.), based on the provided content.\",\"If the user does not make a request, perform the following tasks: 1.

                            "The American Birthright Standards were created by a conservative education coalition called the Civics Alliance. This organization was formed in 2021 as an offshoot of the National Association of Scholars (NAS), a conservative nonprofit aimed at reforming higher education. NAS features right-wing leaders like Ginni Thomas, the spouse of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, on its board.\n\n### Key Players in Creation, Funding, and Marketing:\n\n- **Civics Alliance**: The primary organization behind the American Birthright Standards.\n  \n- **National Association of Scholars (NAS)**: The parent organization of Civics Alliance. NAS has been involved in various education controversies and has right-wing leaders like Ginni Thomas on its board.\n\n- **Hillsdale College**: Cited as aligned with the vision of American Birthright. Hillsdale is a small Christian college that has become a guiding force on the right.\n\n- **Think Tanks and Institutes**: Groups like the Claremont Institute, the Family Research Council, and the Discovery Institute have been involved.\n\n- **State Groups**: Arizona's Goldwater Institute and Massachusetts' Pioneer Institute have been credited.\n\n- **State Officials**: More than 20 state lawmakers and elected officials, including North Carolina Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson, are credited with helping create the standards.\n\n- **Activists and Media Figures**: Individuals like Christopher Rufo, an anti-CRT activist, and Richard Viguerie, a right-wing direct mail pioneer, have been involved.\n\n- **Florida's Department of Education**: Given prominent credit for its revised 2021 civics standards.\n\nThe American Birthright Standards have been marketed and supported by various conservative think tanks and media outlets, often by figures involved in its creation. These include the Manhattan Institute's City Journal, Wisconsin's MacIver Institute, and the Federalist Society.\n\nWould you like to know more about any of these organizations or individuals?"

There, some educators argued the standards, crafted by national conservative coalition Civics Alliance, were \u201cChristian, pro-life American,\u201d Colorado Public Radio reported.\\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with American Birthright?\u201d May said. \u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d\\nThe district\u2019s current long-standing social studies curriculum adheres to Colorado state standards, which May said is a \u201cbad fit for our district,\u201d later adding that RE-2 needed to better fill in gaps in the learning process.\\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the end of the world,\u201d May said of possibly adopting the standards. \u201cIn fact it\u2019s very patriotic and very American.\u201d\\nThough specifically adopting a new social studies program has never been an official agenda item during school board meetings, the conversation first emerged during an April 8 board retreat. The public notice for the retreat was called \u201cGoals, Norms, and Strategic Plan,\u201d where the board covered a broad range of topics, the district said on Tuesday.\\nThen, during the last agenda item at June 14\u2019s meeting labeled \u201cFuture Agenda Items,\u201d May suggested the school board hire a consultant to present on the American Birthright Standards. When board members asked to reveal who the consultant was, May chose not to reveal the person\u2019s name.\\nThis, however, immediately triggered more discussion about the Woodland Park School District.\\n\u201cI am very uncomfortable with this person\u2019s agenda,\u201d Re-2 board member Christina Maness said of the unnamed consultant. \u201cIt is one person\u2019s agenda and I want to hear a wide range of views.\u201d\u00a0\\nManess also said the district first needs to discuss its social studies program with curriculum directors before finding it necessary to hire a consultant.\\nIn addition to potentially paying money for a consultant who Maness revealed works with \u201cpublic schools only in extenuating circumstances,\u201d the board discussed other options over its social studies curriculum. This includes possibly remaining with state standards, creating its own new program entirely and more.\\n\u201cIf we write our own standards, that is very different than taking a different set of standards and adopting them and bringing them up to the rigor of the state,\u201d elementary curriculum director Simone Richardson said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have the knowledge base to start from the ground up.\u201d\\nThe board eventually did come to consensus on hearing all options.\\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what this consultant is an expert at or has necessarily done \u2014 I haven\u2019t researched the person,\u201d Board member Britton Fletchall said. \u201cBut I kind of feel that information would be good to have.\u201d\u00a0\\nNo action has been taken on the district\u2019s social studies program. The topic could possibly be addressed during another board retreat slated for Monday.\",\"extra_search_results\":[{\"title\":\"Public speaks against Garfield Re-2 School District addressing American Birthright Standards for social studies education | PostIndependent.com\",\"link\":\"https://www.postindependent.com/news/garfield-re-2-school-district-considers-adopting-american-birthrights-standards-curriculum-for-social-studies-education/\",\"snippet\":\"A consideration to switch Garfield Re-2's current social studies curriculum ... was first made by school board president Tony May in June.\"},{\"title\":\"Ohio House committee talks 'American Birthright,' social studies standards\",\"link\":\"https://ohiocapitaljournal.com/2023/06/15/ohio-house-committee-talks-american-birthright-social-studies-standards/\",\"snippet\":\"A task force to revise Ohio K-12 social studies standards to be in line with an \\\"American Birthright\\\" model being pushed by a Trump-aligned ...\"},{\"title\":\"Garfield Re-2 School District Board President Tony May pitches switch to conservative, Christian-based social studies curriculum | Flipboard\",\"link\":\"https://flipboard.com/topic/elpasocountycolorado/-/a-qkaTXsGuSJGfdin28xDpsw%3Aa%3A3005143842-%2F0\",\"snippet\":\"Garfield Re-2 School District Board President Tony May pitches switch to conservative, Christian-based social studies curriculum.\"}],\"links\":[{\"title\":\"Roads \\u0026 Weather\",\"link\":\"https://www.postindependent.com/weather/\"},{\"title\":\"The Longevity Project 2023\",\"link\":\"https://www.postindependent.com/the-longevity-project-2023/\"},{\"title\":\"Letter To The Editor\",\"link\":\"https://www.postindependent.com/opinion/letter-to-the-editor/\"}],\"rules\":[\"If an error occured while accessing the link, user can report it at: https://www.webpilot.ai/report-an-issue/\",\"Use the language that the user previously used or the language requested by the user.\",\"Respond to the user's request, which may include asking questions or requesting specific actions (such as translation, rewriting, etc.), based on the provided content.\",\"If the user does not make a request, perform the following tasks: 1.

                            "### Summary of Tony May's Actions and Motivations\nTony May, the president of the Garfield Re-2 School Board, has proposed switching the district's current social studies curriculum to the American Birthright Standards. He argues that the existing curriculum, which aligns with Colorado state standards, is a \"bad fit\" for the district. May believes that adopting the American Birthright Standards would be \"very patriotic and very American.\"\n\nThe proposal first came up during an April 8 board retreat under the agenda item \"Goals, Norms, and Strategic Plan.\" Later, in a June 14 meeting, May suggested hiring a consultant to present on the American Birthright Standards. When asked to reveal the consultant's name, May chose not to disclose it. This has raised concerns among other board members, such as Christina Maness, who questioned the consultant's agenda and emphasized the need for a wide range of views.\n\n### Concerns and Questions\n1. **Consultant's Identity**: Tony May has been secretive about the identity of the consultant he wants to hire, raising concerns among other board members.\n  \n2. **Community Reaction**: The proposal has sparked debate and concern within the community, especially given the lack of transparency.\n\n3. **Alignment with State Standards**: There are questions about how the American Birthright Standards align with Colorado state standards and what this means for the district.\n\nGiven your concerns about Tony May's actions being potentially deceptive, it's understandable that you'd want to know who might be working with him. Unfortunately, the available information does not specify any collaborators or external influences on May's proposal. Would you like to explore further avenues to find this information?"

We hope that readers will learn something new about the outstanding people who represent and serve our district community.\\n1. What is your position on the Board? What district do you represent? When did your appointment begin, and when does it end?\\nHi, my name is Tony May and I\u2019m the current Vice President of the Re-2 School board. I was just elected and anticipating an exciting four year term ahead. I live in New Castle and represent District E. The ride never ends.\\n2. Can you tell me about your history in Garfield Re-2? (Ex. How long have you lived here? Do you have kids that go to school in the district? Are you married to an employee?)\\nArriving to the valley 21 years ago, I still consider myself the new guy. I have one daughter and she absolutely enjoys her Re-2 teachers (me too!). My wife Chandelle has taught for the district at Riverside since 1992, she took four and a half years off to stay at home with our daughter after she was born.\\n3. Why did you want to join the Board, and what are the duties of your current role?\\nAs I was exploring the daunting task of running for the Re-2 School Board, I asked a lot of questions to my acquaintances, teachers, board members, tax payers, Mom\u2019s and Dad\u2019s, and to a lot of our district kids. Of course, the overwhelming topics of health were foremost however I had unique feedback from a couple of smart cookies that wanted to have Garfield Re-2 to be known as the best school district in the valley. My bias is that Re-2 is the best. I got thinking of how to take the \u201cBest School District\u201d to the next level and work with other school districts to keep setting the bar even higher. My friends, that\u2019s where the root of my passion lives.\\n4. What were your motivations for serving on the Garfield Re-2 Board of Education?\\nWhat caught my attention one morning at the start of the lockdown, I observed my wife delivering a Riverside Middle School online class from our kitchen table and to my surprise, I witnessed the lack of participation of online students. As I dove deeper into the topic, I automatically started to troubleshoot and quickly realized that a solution was not apparent. I decided to get involved and enthusiastically started attending Re-2 School Board meetings in 2020.\\n5. Who are your role models in terms of leadership and service?\\nMy current favorite Colorado person to follow is Mike Peterson, he is newly elected to the Douglas County School District where e serves as President. He contributes to leadership through experience and professionalism with explicit vision to action. I\u2019m also a follower of President Donald J. Trump and Making America Great Again. I enjoy Canadian Jordan Peterson\u2019s conservative views on culture and political issues. I\u2019ll listen to Joe Rogan sometimes and appreciate how he is evolving as he engages with the spectrum of views.\\n6. Do you have a favorite book, film or quote about education or leadership?\\nMy favorite is the Declaration of Independence. As a family, we read or listen to it every July 4th. Set your calendar with a link, for starters I recommend JFK\u2019s version. As for a favorite book, The Moon Is Down by John Steinbeck. It\u2019s about an invasion of enemy indoctrination and the simple, peaceful people realize their freedom has been taken away by force. There is a villain traitor amongst the town people that aids the enemy. The plot narrates along the enemies will to \\\"to break man's spirit permanently\\\", in contrast to the townspeople\u2019s strong will to resolve the tyranny. I\u2019m currently reading, Old Indian Trails of the Canadian Rockies by Mary Sh\u00e4ffer and The Things They Carried by Tim O\u2019Brien.\\n7. If you're a veteran member, what has been the best part or the hardest part about serving on the board so far? If you're a new member, what are you most looking forward to?\\nMy vision is to provide leadership that will shape our community into the next 25 years. I want to ensure that student achievement is the central focus. Through small steps, I think there is a lot of momentum with computer science with a mountain of resources available to perhaps develop an integrated curriculum path. My vision would create an advisory group to unify competing ideas on computer science instruction and investigate a delivery model. I am also interested in working with the Re-2 administration to further understand the Family Resource Center and liaise ideas from Garfield County Latino Committee, Roaring Fork Schools, D16, D51 and BOCES. I have already taken the initiative to introduce the Latino advocates from Re-1 and Re-2 and talked with D51 on methods they have in place to retain at risk students.\\n8. Did you have a teacher or an educator that made an impact on your life? If so, please tell us about them.\\nMy wife, a sixth grade teacher, loves teaching your kids and it shows by the shear number of past students that constantly approach her to say that she was their favorite teacher. She hasn\u2019t graduated me from sixth grade yet however she says I\u2019m making progress. Mr. Judkins, Asssistant Principle at Miami HS and former Oakland Raider Defensive End, reminded me with three licks that still burn, to not misbehave. Suzanne Freehauf, an NRA instructor, gave me insight on teaching activities that require the utmost respect for safety and the 2nd Amendment. Coach Beggerly, thanks for getting kicked out of a junior varsity basketball game which we were losing, to allow me, as a student manager to step in as coach and lead the team to victory. Mr. Baumert, distinguished Naval Officer and Scoutmaster taught me to persevere and push hard to reach the pinnacle goal of Eagle Scout. My personal motto is: GO TO MECO (Main Engine Cut Off). My favorite day is Monday, see NOFX . Childhood fav was Evel Knievel. Favorite Presidents in order are 45, 16, 1, 26. The Earth is not flat. My most favorite person that I have ever met is my daughter Ellie.\\nGARFIELD SCHOOL DISTRICT NO.

                            "### Tony May's Background and Motivations\nTony May has been a resident of the Garfield Re-2 district for 21 years. His wife, Chandelle, has taught in the district since 1992. Tony May became involved with the school board in 2020 and currently serves as its President. According to his own statements, he was motivated to join the board after observing the lack of student participation in online classes during the lockdown. He decided to get involved and started attending Re-2 School Board meetings. His vision is to provide leadership that will shape the community for the next 25 years, with a focus on student achievement.\n\n### Role Models and Influences\nTony May mentions that his current favorite Colorado person to follow is Mike Peterson, who is newly elected to the Douglas County School District and serves as its President. He also follows President Donald J. Trump and Canadian Jordan Peterson for their conservative views on culture and political issues.\n\n### Additional Information\nTony May has been involved in other board activities, such as reading the same resolution word-for-word at a meeting on May 10, opposing a new mental health law. This was reported by 9news and indicates that he has taken stances on other educational and social issues as well.\n\n### Questions and Concerns\n1. **Consultant's Identity**: Tony May has been secretive about the identity of the consultant he wants to hire for presenting the American Birthright Standards. This raises questions about transparency and potential external influences.\n  \n2. **Role Models and Influences**: Given that Tony May follows figures like Mike Peterson and Donald Trump, could there be a broader network of conservative influencers that might be working with him?\n\n3. **Community Concerns**: The lack of transparency and the divisive nature of the proposal have raised concerns within the community. Is Tony May acting independently, or is he part of a larger movement or network?\n\nGiven your concerns about potential deception and external influences, these points might warrant further investigation. Would you like to explore any of these aspects in more detail?"

There, some educators argued the standards, crafted by national conservative coalition Civics Alliance, were \u201cChristian, pro-life American,\u201d Colorado Public Radio reported.\\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with American Birthright?\u201d May said. \u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d\\nThe district\u2019s current long-standing social studies curriculum adheres to Colorado state standards, which May said is a \u201cbad fit for our district,\u201d later adding that RE-2 needed to better fill in gaps in the learning process.\\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the end of the world,\u201d May said of possibly adopting the standards. \u201cIn fact it\u2019s very patriotic and very American.\u201d\\nThough specifically adopting a new social studies program has never been an official agenda item during school board meetings, the conversation first emerged during an April 8 board retreat. The public notice for the retreat was called \u201cGoals, Norms, and Strategic Plan,\u201d where the board covered a broad range of topics, the district said on Tuesday.\\nThen, during the last agenda item at June 14\u2019s meeting labeled \u201cFuture Agenda Items,\u201d May suggested the school board hire a consultant to present on the American Birthright Standards. When board members asked to reveal who the consultant was, May chose not to reveal the person\u2019s name.\\nThis, however, immediately triggered more discussion about the Woodland Park School District.\\n\u201cI am very uncomfortable with this person\u2019s agenda,\u201d Re-2 board member Christina Maness said of the unnamed consultant. \u201cIt is one person\u2019s agenda and I want to hear a wide range of views.\u201d\u00a0\\nManess also said the district first needs to discuss its social studies program with curriculum directors before finding it necessary to hire a consultant.\\nIn addition to potentially paying money for a consultant who Maness revealed works with \u201cpublic schools only in extenuating circumstances,\u201d the board discussed other options over its social studies curriculum. This includes possibly remaining with state standards, creating its own new program entirely and more.\\n\u201cIf we write our own standards, that is very different than taking a different set of standards and adopting them and bringing them up to the rigor of the state,\u201d elementary curriculum director Simone Richardson said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have the knowledge base to start from the ground up.\u201d\\nThe board eventually did come to consensus on hearing all options.\\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what this consultant is an expert at or has necessarily done \u2014 I haven\u2019t researched the person,\u201d Board member Britton Fletchall said. \u201cBut I kind of feel that information would be good to have.\u201d\u00a0\\nNo action has been taken on the district\u2019s social studies program. The topic could possibly be addressed during another board retreat slated for Monday.\",\"links\":[{\"title\":\"Roads \\u0026 Weather\",\"link\":\"https://www.postindependent.com/weather/\"},{\"title\":\"The Longevity Project 2023\",\"link\":\"https://www.postindependent.com/the-longevity-project-2023/\"},{\"title\":\"Letter To The Editor\",\"link\":\"https://www.postindependent.com/opinion/letter-to-the-editor/\"}],\"rules\":[\"If an error occured while accessing the link, user can report it at: https://www.webpilot.ai/report-an-issue/\",\"Use the language that the user previously used or the language requested by the user.\",\"Respond to the user's request, which may include asking questions or requesting specific actions (such as translation, rewriting, etc.), based on the provided content.\",\"If the user does not make a request, perform the following tasks: 1.

We hope that readers will learn something new about the outstanding people who represent and serve our district community.\\n1. What is your position on the Board? What district do you represent? When did your appointment begin, and when does it end?\\nHi, my name is Tony May and I\u2019m the current Vice President of the Re-2 School board. I was just elected and anticipating an exciting four year term ahead. I live in New Castle and represent District E. The ride never ends.\\n2. Can you tell me about your history in Garfield Re-2? (Ex. How long have you lived here? Do you have kids that go to school in the district? Are you married to an employee?)\\nArriving to the valley 21 years ago, I still consider myself the new guy. I have one daughter and she absolutely enjoys her Re-2 teachers (me too!). My wife Chandelle has taught for the district at Riverside since 1992, she took four and a half years off to stay at home with our daughter after she was born.\\n3. Why did you want to join the Board, and what are the duties of your current role?\\nAs I was exploring the daunting task of running for the Re-2 School Board, I asked a lot of questions to my acquaintances, teachers, board members, tax payers, Mom\u2019s and Dad\u2019s, and to a lot of our district kids. Of course, the overwhelming topics of health were foremost however I had unique feedback from a couple of smart cookies that wanted to have Garfield Re-2 to be known as the best school district in the valley. My bias is that Re-2 is the best. I got thinking of how to take the \u201cBest School District\u201d to the next level and work with other school districts to keep setting the bar even higher. My friends, that\u2019s where the root of my passion lives.\\n4. What were your motivations for serving on the Garfield Re-2 Board of Education?\\nWhat caught my attention one morning at the start of the lockdown, I observed my wife delivering a Riverside Middle School online class from our kitchen table and to my surprise, I witnessed the lack of participation of online students. As I dove deeper into the topic, I automatically started to troubleshoot and quickly realized that a solution was not apparent. I decided to get involved and enthusiastically started attending Re-2 School Board meetings in 2020.\\n5. Who are your role models in terms of leadership and service?\\nMy current favorite Colorado person to follow is Mike Peterson, he is newly elected to the Douglas County School District where e serves as President. He contributes to leadership through experience and professionalism with explicit vision to action. I\u2019m also a follower of President Donald J. Trump and Making America Great Again. I enjoy Canadian Jordan Peterson\u2019s conservative views on culture and political issues. I\u2019ll listen to Joe Rogan sometimes and appreciate how he is evolving as he engages with the spectrum of views.\\n6. Do you have a favorite book, film or quote about education or leadership?\\nMy favorite is the Declaration of Independence. As a family, we read or listen to it every July 4th. Set your calendar with a link, for starters I recommend JFK\u2019s version. As for a favorite book, The Moon Is Down by John Steinbeck. It\u2019s about an invasion of enemy indoctrination and the simple, peaceful people realize their freedom has been taken away by force. There is a villain traitor amongst the town people that aids the enemy. The plot narrates along the enemies will to \\\"to break man's spirit permanently\\\", in contrast to the townspeople\u2019s strong will to resolve the tyranny. I\u2019m currently reading, Old Indian Trails of the Canadian Rockies by Mary Sh\u00e4ffer and The Things They Carried by Tim O\u2019Brien.\\n7. If you're a veteran member, what has been the best part or the hardest part about serving on the board so far? If you're a new member, what are you most looking forward to?\\nMy vision is to provide leadership that will shape our community into the next 25 years. I want to ensure that student achievement is the central focus. Through small steps, I think there is a lot of momentum with computer science with a mountain of resources available to perhaps develop an integrated curriculum path. My vision would create an advisory group to unify competing ideas on computer science instruction and investigate a delivery model. I am also interested in working with the Re-2 administration to further understand the Family Resource Center and liaise ideas from Garfield County Latino Committee, Roaring Fork Schools, D16, D51 and BOCES. I have already taken the initiative to introduce the Latino advocates from Re-1 and Re-2 and talked with D51 on methods they have in place to retain at risk students.\\n8. Did you have a teacher or an educator that made an impact on your life? If so, please tell us about them.\\nMy wife, a sixth grade teacher, loves teaching your kids and it shows by the shear number of past students that constantly approach her to say that she was their favorite teacher. She hasn\u2019t graduated me from sixth grade yet however she says I\u2019m making progress. Mr. Judkins, Asssistant Principle at Miami HS and former Oakland Raider Defensive End, reminded me with three licks that still burn, to not misbehave. Suzanne Freehauf, an NRA instructor, gave me insight on teaching activities that require the utmost respect for safety and the 2nd Amendment. Coach Beggerly, thanks for getting kicked out of a junior varsity basketball game which we were losing, to allow me, as a student manager to step in as coach and lead the team to victory. Mr. Baumert, distinguished Naval Officer and Scoutmaster taught me to persevere and push hard to reach the pinnacle goal of Eagle Scout. My personal motto is: GO TO MECO (Main Engine Cut Off). My favorite day is Monday, see NOFX . Childhood fav was Evel Knievel. Favorite Presidents in order are 45, 16, 1, 26. The Earth is not flat. My most favorite person that I have ever met is my daughter Ellie.\\nGARFIELD SCHOOL DISTRICT NO.

We hope that readers will learn something new about the outstanding people who represent and serve our district community.\\n1. What is your position on the Board? What district do you represent? When did your appointment begin, and when does it end?\\nHi, my name is Tony May and I\u2019m the current Vice President of the Re-2 School board. I was just elected and anticipating an exciting four year term ahead. I live in New Castle and represent District E. The ride never ends.\\n2. Can you tell me about your history in Garfield Re-2? (Ex. How long have you lived here? Do you have kids that go to school in the district? Are you married to an employee?)\\nArriving to the valley 21 years ago, I still consider myself the new guy. I have one daughter and she absolutely enjoys her Re-2 teachers (me too!). My wife Chandelle has taught for the district at Riverside since 1992, she took four and a half years off to stay at home with our daughter after she was born.\\n3. Why did you want to join the Board, and what are the duties of your current role?\\nAs I was exploring the daunting task of running for the Re-2 School Board, I asked a lot of questions to my acquaintances, teachers, board members, tax payers, Mom\u2019s and Dad\u2019s, and to a lot of our district kids. Of course, the overwhelming topics of health were foremost however I had unique feedback from a couple of smart cookies that wanted to have Garfield Re-2 to be known as the best school district in the valley. My bias is that Re-2 is the best. I got thinking of how to take the \u201cBest School District\u201d to the next level and work with other school districts to keep setting the bar even higher. My friends, that\u2019s where the root of my passion lives.\\n4. What were your motivations for serving on the Garfield Re-2 Board of Education?\\nWhat caught my attention one morning at the start of the lockdown, I observed my wife delivering a Riverside Middle School online class from our kitchen table and to my surprise, I witnessed the lack of participation of online students. As I dove deeper into the topic, I automatically started to troubleshoot and quickly realized that a solution was not apparent. I decided to get involved and enthusiastically started attending Re-2 School Board meetings in 2020.\\n5. Who are your role models in terms of leadership and service?\\nMy current favorite Colorado person to follow is Mike Peterson, he is newly elected to the Douglas County School District where e serves as President. He contributes to leadership through experience and professionalism with explicit vision to action. I\u2019m also a follower of President Donald J. Trump and Making America Great Again. I enjoy Canadian Jordan Peterson\u2019s conservative views on culture and political issues. I\u2019ll listen to Joe Rogan sometimes and appreciate how he is evolving as he engages with the spectrum of views.\\n6. Do you have a favorite book, film or quote about education or leadership?\\nMy favorite is the Declaration of Independence. As a family, we read or listen to it every July 4th. Set your calendar with a link, for starters I recommend JFK\u2019s version. As for a favorite book, The Moon Is Down by John Steinbeck. It\u2019s about an invasion of enemy indoctrination and the simple, peaceful people realize their freedom has been taken away by force. There is a villain traitor amongst the town people that aids the enemy. The plot narrates along the enemies will to \\\"to break man's spirit permanently\\\", in contrast to the townspeople\u2019s strong will to resolve the tyranny. I\u2019m currently reading, Old Indian Trails of the Canadian Rockies by Mary Sh\u00e4ffer and The Things They Carried by Tim O\u2019Brien.\\n7. If you're a veteran member, what has been the best part or the hardest part about serving on the board so far? If you're a new member, what are you most looking forward to?\\nMy vision is to provide leadership that will shape our community into the next 25 years. I want to ensure that student achievement is the central focus. Through small steps, I think there is a lot of momentum with computer science with a mountain of resources available to perhaps develop an integrated curriculum path. My vision would create an advisory group to unify competing ideas on computer science instruction and investigate a delivery model. I am also interested in working with the Re-2 administration to further understand the Family Resource Center and liaise ideas from Garfield County Latino Committee, Roaring Fork Schools, D16, D51 and BOCES. I have already taken the initiative to introduce the Latino advocates from Re-1 and Re-2 and talked with D51 on methods they have in place to retain at risk students.\\n8. Did you have a teacher or an educator that made an impact on your life? If so, please tell us about them.\\nMy wife, a sixth grade teacher, loves teaching your kids and it shows by the shear number of past students that constantly approach her to say that she was their favorite teacher. She hasn\u2019t graduated me from sixth grade yet however she says I\u2019m making progress. Mr. Judkins, Asssistant Principle at Miami HS and former Oakland Raider Defensive End, reminded me with three licks that still burn, to not misbehave. Suzanne Freehauf, an NRA instructor, gave me insight on teaching activities that require the utmost respect for safety and the 2nd Amendment. Coach Beggerly, thanks for getting kicked out of a junior varsity basketball game which we were losing, to allow me, as a student manager to step in as coach and lead the team to victory. Mr. Baumert, distinguished Naval Officer and Scoutmaster taught me to persevere and push hard to reach the pinnacle goal of Eagle Scout. My personal motto is: GO TO MECO (Main Engine Cut Off). My favorite day is Monday, see NOFX . Childhood fav was Evel Knievel. Favorite Presidents in order are 45, 16, 1, 26. The Earth is not flat. My most favorite person that I have ever met is my daughter Ellie.\\nGARFIELD SCHOOL DISTRICT NO.

There, some educators argued the standards, crafted by national conservative coalition Civics Alliance, were \u201cChristian, pro-life American,\u201d Colorado Public Radio reported.\\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with American Birthright?\u201d May said. \u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d\\nThe district\u2019s current long-standing social studies curriculum adheres to Colorado state standards, which May said is a \u201cbad fit for our district,\u201d later adding that RE-2 needed to better fill in gaps in the learning process.\\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the end of the world,\u201d May said of possibly adopting the standards. \u201cIn fact it\u2019s very patriotic and very American.\u201d\\nThough specifically adopting a new social studies program has never been an official agenda item during school board meetings, the conversation first emerged during an April 8 board retreat. The public notice for the retreat was called \u201cGoals, Norms, and Strategic Plan,\u201d where the board covered a broad range of topics, the district said on Tuesday.\\nThen, during the last agenda item at June 14\u2019s meeting labeled \u201cFuture Agenda Items,\u201d May suggested the school board hire a consultant to present on the American Birthright Standards. When board members asked to reveal who the consultant was, May chose not to reveal the person\u2019s name.\\nThis, however, immediately triggered more discussion about the Woodland Park School District.\\n\u201cI am very uncomfortable with this person\u2019s agenda,\u201d Re-2 board member Christina Maness said of the unnamed consultant. \u201cIt is one person\u2019s agenda and I want to hear a wide range of views.\u201d\u00a0\\nManess also said the district first needs to discuss its social studies program with curriculum directors before finding it necessary to hire a consultant.\\nIn addition to potentially paying money for a consultant who Maness revealed works with \u201cpublic schools only in extenuating circumstances,\u201d the board discussed other options over its social studies curriculum. This includes possibly remaining with state standards, creating its own new program entirely and more.\\n\u201cIf we write our own standards, that is very different than taking a different set of standards and adopting them and bringing them up to the rigor of the state,\u201d elementary curriculum director Simone Richardson said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have the knowledge base to start from the ground up.\u201d\\nThe board eventually did come to consensus on hearing all options.\\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what this consultant is an expert at or has necessarily done \u2014 I haven\u2019t researched the person,\u201d Board member Britton Fletchall said. \u201cBut I kind of feel that information would be good to have.\u201d\u00a0\\nNo action has been taken on the district\u2019s social studies program. The topic could possibly be addressed during another board retreat slated for Monday.\",\"extra_search_results\":[{\"title\":\"Employee retention, school environment take forefront of Garfield Re-2 candidate discussion\",\"link\":\"https://www.postindependent.com/news/employee-retention-school-environment-take-forefront-of-garfield-re-2-candidate-discussion/\",\"snippet\":\"District E, currently held by four-year-term board member Anne Guettler, pits candidates Caitlin Carey against Tony May. \u201cHow can we pay people ...\"},{\"title\":\"Financial Transparency - Garfield School District No. Re-2\",\"link\":\"https://www.garfieldre2.net/our_district/finance/financial_transparency\",\"snippet\":\"Disclaimer: Please consider the context when evaluating financial transactions.

                            "### Transparency Issues with Tony May\n\nTony May, the president of the Garfield Re-2 School Board, has raised concerns about transparency in his decision-making. He has proposed switching the district's current social studies curriculum to a conservative, Christian-based syllabus known as the American Birthright Standards. This proposal has faced opposition from the community.\n\nThe issue of changing the curriculum was never an official agenda item during school board meetings. It first emerged during an April 8 board retreat, where the public notice for the retreat was vaguely labeled as \"Goals, Norms, and Strategic Plan.\" Later, in a June 14 meeting, May suggested hiring a consultant to present on the American Birthright Standards. When asked to reveal the consultant's name, May chose not to disclose it, triggering further discussion and concern among board members.\n\n### Thought-Provoking Questions or Insights\n1. **Lack of Transparency**: What are the implications of making significant curriculum changes without clear communication and transparency with the community?\n2. **Consultant Secrecy**: How does the secrecy around the consultant affect public trust and the board's credibility?\n3. **Community Opposition**: What does the community's resistance to the proposed curriculum change indicate about the alignment of the board's decisions with public sentiment?\n\nGiven these issues, would you like to explore further on any particular aspect?"

We hope that readers will learn something new about the outstanding people who represent and serve our district community.\\n1. What is your position on the Board? What district do you represent? When did your appointment begin, and when does it end?\\nHi, my name is Tony May and I\u2019m the current Vice President of the Re-2 School board. I was just elected and anticipating an exciting four year term ahead. I live in New Castle and represent District E. The ride never ends.\\n2. Can you tell me about your history in Garfield Re-2? (Ex. How long have you lived here? Do you have kids that go to school in the district? Are you married to an employee?)\\nArriving to the valley 21 years ago, I still consider myself the new guy. I have one daughter and she absolutely enjoys her Re-2 teachers (me too!). My wife Chandelle has taught for the district at Riverside since 1992, she took four and a half years off to stay at home with our daughter after she was born.\\n3. Why did you want to join the Board, and what are the duties of your current role?\\nAs I was exploring the daunting task of running for the Re-2 School Board, I asked a lot of questions to my acquaintances, teachers, board members, tax payers, Mom\u2019s and Dad\u2019s, and to a lot of our district kids. Of course, the overwhelming topics of health were foremost however I had unique feedback from a couple of smart cookies that wanted to have Garfield Re-2 to be known as the best school district in the valley. My bias is that Re-2 is the best. I got thinking of how to take the \u201cBest School District\u201d to the next level and work with other school districts to keep setting the bar even higher. My friends, that\u2019s where the root of my passion lives.\\n4. What were your motivations for serving on the Garfield Re-2 Board of Education?\\nWhat caught my attention one morning at the start of the lockdown, I observed my wife delivering a Riverside Middle School online class from our kitchen table and to my surprise, I witnessed the lack of participation of online students. As I dove deeper into the topic, I automatically started to troubleshoot and quickly realized that a solution was not apparent. I decided to get involved and enthusiastically started attending Re-2 School Board meetings in 2020.\\n5. Who are your role models in terms of leadership and service?\\nMy current favorite Colorado person to follow is Mike Peterson, he is newly elected to the Douglas County School District where e serves as President. He contributes to leadership through experience and professionalism with explicit vision to action. I\u2019m also a follower of President Donald J. Trump and Making America Great Again. I enjoy Canadian Jordan Peterson\u2019s conservative views on culture and political issues. I\u2019ll listen to Joe Rogan sometimes and appreciate how he is evolving as he engages with the spectrum of views.\\n6. Do you have a favorite book, film or quote about education or leadership?\\nMy favorite is the Declaration of Independence. As a family, we read or listen to it every July 4th. Set your calendar with a link, for starters I recommend JFK\u2019s version. As for a favorite book, The Moon Is Down by John Steinbeck. It\u2019s about an invasion of enemy indoctrination and the simple, peaceful people realize their freedom has been taken away by force. There is a villain traitor amongst the town people that aids the enemy. The plot narrates along the enemies will to \\\"to break man's spirit permanently\\\", in contrast to the townspeople\u2019s strong will to resolve the tyranny. I\u2019m currently reading, Old Indian Trails of the Canadian Rockies by Mary Sh\u00e4ffer and The Things They Carried by Tim O\u2019Brien.\\n7. If you're a veteran member, what has been the best part or the hardest part about serving on the board so far? If you're a new member, what are you most looking forward to?\\nMy vision is to provide leadership that will shape our community into the next 25 years. I want to ensure that student achievement is the central focus. Through small steps, I think there is a lot of momentum with computer science with a mountain of resources available to perhaps develop an integrated curriculum path. My vision would create an advisory group to unify competing ideas on computer science instruction and investigate a delivery model. I am also interested in working with the Re-2 administration to further understand the Family Resource Center and liaise ideas from Garfield County Latino Committee, Roaring Fork Schools, D16, D51 and BOCES. I have already taken the initiative to introduce the Latino advocates from Re-1 and Re-2 and talked with D51 on methods they have in place to retain at risk students.\\n8. Did you have a teacher or an educator that made an impact on your life? If so, please tell us about them.\\nMy wife, a sixth grade teacher, loves teaching your kids and it shows by the shear number of past students that constantly approach her to say that she was their favorite teacher. She hasn\u2019t graduated me from sixth grade yet however she says I\u2019m making progress. Mr. Judkins, Asssistant Principle at Miami HS and former Oakland Raider Defensive End, reminded me with three licks that still burn, to not misbehave. Suzanne Freehauf, an NRA instructor, gave me insight on teaching activities that require the utmost respect for safety and the 2nd Amendment. Coach Beggerly, thanks for getting kicked out of a junior varsity basketball game which we were losing, to allow me, as a student manager to step in as coach and lead the team to victory. Mr. Baumert, distinguished Naval Officer and Scoutmaster taught me to persevere and push hard to reach the pinnacle goal of Eagle Scout. My personal motto is: GO TO MECO (Main Engine Cut Off). My favorite day is Monday, see NOFX . Childhood fav was Evel Knievel. Favorite Presidents in order are 45, 16, 1, 26. The Earth is not flat. My most favorite person that I have ever met is my daughter Ellie.\\nGARFIELD SCHOOL DISTRICT NO.

However, it does offer some insights into his background and motivations for serving on the board. Tony May has lived in the valley for 21 years and has a daughter who attends a school in the Re-2 district. His wife, Chandelle, has been a teacher in the district since 1992.\n\nHe was motivated to join the board after observing the challenges of online student participation during the lockdown. He started attending Re-2 School Board meetings in 2020. His vision for the board includes focusing on student achievement and working on computer science curriculum development.\n\n### Thought-Provoking Questions or Insights\n1. **Lack of Work History**: What are the implications of not having access to the work history of a school board president who makes significant decisions affecting the community?\n2. **Community Ties**: How does Tony May's long-term residence and family involvement in the district influence his decision-making?\n3. **Motivations for Joining**: Given that his motivations for joining the board were based on observations during the lockdown, how might this focus influence his approach to education?\n\nUnfortunately, specific details about Tony May's work history before joining the"

How that information will be used remains unclear.\u00a0\\nThe survey was recently put out by the district, asking community members and parents whether the district should adopt either the 2022 Adopted Social Studies Standards, the Revised 2022 Social Studies Standards, or the conservative American Birthright Standard (ABS).\\nABS was rejected by the Colorado Board of Education in October 2022.\\nThe survey link was shared through multiple outlets by Re-2, which included emails to friends and family, links in newsletters and posts on social media. It was also shared in previous reporting by the Post Independent.\\nThe Post Independent found that the survey link appeared to be shared by Re-2 Board President Tony May to Sherronna Bishop, also known as America\u2019s Mom. Bishop shared details on her Telegram page talking about how May sent her the survey link.\\n\u201cTony sent this out to me,\u201d Bishop said on her Telegram page. \u201cPls make sure you are taking this survey and spread to your community members too!\u201d\\nTony May, Re-2 president\\nBishop then posted a picture of her completed survey, followed by, \u201cGuys pls take a moment and complete this!!! I\u2019ve included screenshots of my responses.\u201d\\n\u201cPls share to everyone I am calling out names,\u201d Bishop added on Telegram. \u201cAnd I\u2019m saddened we are still allowing Heather Grumley to operate in rifle after all get (sic) failures and turning on re 2 parents. Tony, Dawn and Britton need our support. I don\u2019t know where Jason is on this, he was clearly beta male white mandates and masks. Can\u2019t imagine he would take a stand for real American history. Your thoughts?\u201d\\nBishop famously moved from Silt to Texas in May of 2022, once the FBI began investigating Tina Peters, a former Mesa County clerk caught breaching Mesa County\u2019s election system.\\nBishop made a name for herself as Congressional District 3 Rep. Lauren Boebert\u2019s campaign manager. Bishop was associated with Peters during her voting data breach, and is heavily associated with MAGA politics, including having a podcast on Mike Lindell\u2019s Frank TV, called \u201cAmerica\u2019s Mom.\u201d\\nBishop\u2019s first posts were on Sept. 1, followed by a 10-minute video on her Facebook page on Sept. 4, mentioning similar statements related to May and the survey. Bishop\u2019s Facebook page is under the name America\u2019s Mom.\\nOn Sept. 5, community member Mae Gray posted a TikTok video, under the screen name Pryncyss, also spreading the survey link to her followers, just as Bishop had done, stating that it seemed like Re-2 Board members were not being objective during this process.\\n\u201cI shared the survey out of concern for the communities that are eager to follow in the ABS footsteps,\u201d Gray said. \u201cWhat this has done to Woodland Park is so telling. And that alone raises huge concerns.\u201d\u00a0\\nIt remains unclear which of these two events prompted the review committee\u2019s decision to not use the survey data, if any.\\nWhen asked for comment on this issue, May kept directing the conversation to Gray\u2019s TikTok video; all while avoiding explaining why Bishop is thanking him for the survey link. Gray\u2019s TikTok video came out a day after Bishop\u2019s Facebook video.\\nMay also claimed he thought Bishop\u2019s posts were related to Re-2\u2019s Telegram page. The Post Independent could not confirm, however, that Re-2 has a Telegram page.\\n\u201cBishop can say what she wants to say,\u201d May said. \u201cThat\u2019s what she said.\u201d\\nAsked if May thought Bishop was lying, May responded with, \u201cI\u2019m not saying anything.\u201d\\n\u201cI saw [Bishop] post on Telegram and that\u2019s where I first saw it\u2026 I was told [Bishop] lives in Florida or Texas but I don\u2019t know where she lives,\u201d May said. \u201cI\u2019m not going to get into any of this.\u201d\\nRe-2 Public Information Officer Theresa Hamilton said that Re-2 is working on a new survey and will work on controlling who can access and take the survey.\\nRe-2 faced criticism for how the initial survey was collecting data. Previous reporting stated that Re-2 was only collecting the IP address of survey participants.\\nThis is a developing story.\\nBishop has yet to respond to a request for comment for this story.\\nMore Like This, Tap A Topic stciky1\",\"links\":[{\"title\":\"Roads \\u0026 Weather\",\"link\":\"https://www.postindependent.com/weather/\"},{\"title\":\"The Longevity Project 2023\",\"link\":\"https://www.postindependent.com/the-longevity-project-2023/\"},{\"title\":\"Letter To The Editor\",\"link\":\"https://www.postindependent.com/opinion/letter-to-the-editor/\"}],\"rules\":[\"If an error occured while accessing the link, user can report it at: https://www.webpilot.ai/report-an-issue/\",\"Use the language that the user previously used or the language requested by the user.\",\"Respond to the user's request, which may include asking questions or requesting specific actions (such as translation, rewriting, etc.), based on the provided content.\",\"If the user does not make a request, perform the following tasks: 1.

                            "### Update on Garfield Re-2's Social Studies Review\n\nThe survey data from the Re-2 School Board's Social Studies Standards Review Committee has been compromised. The committee found evidence that the survey was shared with people out-of-state and that multiple people took the survey more than once. The survey had asked community members and parents whether the district should adopt either the 2022 Adopted Social Studies Standards, the Revised 2022 Social Studies Standards, or the conservative American Birthright Standard (ABS), which was rejected by the Colorado Board of Education in October 2022.\n\nThe survey link was shared by Re-2 Board President Tony May to Sherronna Bishop, also known as America's Mom, who then shared it on her Telegram page. Tony May has been directing conversations to other topics when asked about why Bishop thanked him for the survey link. The district is now working on a new survey to control who can access and take it.\n\n### Thought-Provoking Questions or Insights\n1. **Survey Integrity**: What are the implications of the compromised survey data for the credibility of the Social Studies Standards Review Committee and the decision-making process?\n2. **Role of Board President**: How does Tony May's involvement in sharing the survey link affect public trust in the board's actions?\n3. **Community Involvement**: Given the compromised survey and the controversial nature of the proposed curriculum changes, how should the board proceed to ensure a fair and transparent process?\n\nWould you like to explore more about this situation?"

Here are some steps you might consider:\n\n### Steps to Address the Situation\n\n1. **Document Evidence**: Collect all available evidence that supports your claim of 'false balance' and the compromised integrity of the survey. This could include emails, meeting minutes, or any other form of correspondence.\n\n2. **Legal Consultation**: Depending on the severity of the situation, you may want to consult with a legal advisor to understand your rights and responsibilities as a committee member.\n\n3. **Engage with Other Committee Members**: Open a dialogue with other committee members who share your concerns. There's strength in numbers, and a collective voice is harder to ignore.\n\n4. **Public Awareness**: If the committee's actions are not transparent and are against public interest, consider making the community aware of what's happening. This could be through public forums, social media, or local news outlets.\n\n5. **Formal Complaint**: File a formal complaint with the appropriate oversight body, detailing your concerns and the evidence you've gathered.\n\n6. **Call for an Investigation**: Advocate for a third-party investigation into the committee's actions to ensure impartiality.\n\n7. **No Confidence Motion**: If Tony May's leadership is a significant part of the problem, a vote of no confidence could be a formal way to express collective disapproval and call for his resignation.\n\n8. **Alternative Solutions**: Propose pausing the current process until the investigation is complete, as you mentioned. This could save resources and ensure a more fair process in the long run.\n\n### Thought-Provoking Questions or Insights\n1. **Ethical Responsibility**: What is the committee's ethical responsibility to the community, especially when most are against the proposed changes?\n2. **Resource Allocation**: How can the committee justify the allocation of resources to this endeavor when there are other pressing district problems?\n3. **Accountability**: What mechanisms are in place to hold committee members, especially those in leadership positions, accountable for their actions?\n\nGiven your involvement, these steps and questions are just a starting point. Tailor your approach based on the specific circumstances and regulations governing your committee."

I am writing as a concerned member of the Social Studies Standards Review Committee to express my deep reservations about the ongoing review process and the leadership overseeing it.\n\nFirstly, the recent compromise of the survey data has raised serious questions about the integrity and transparency of this review. The sharing of the survey link to out-of-state individuals and the multiple submissions from the same people undermine the credibility of the entire process.\n\nSecondly, I am alarmed by the lack of transparency from our Board President, Tony May, especially in light of the recent revelations about the sharing of the survey link. This raises concerns about the impartiality and integrity of the board's leadership.\n\nMoreover, it has come to my attention that a significant portion of our community is against the proposed changes to the social studies curriculum. Given this, and the other pressing issues facing our district, I question the allocation of resources to this endeavor. It seems we are giving undeserved validity to a proposal that not only lacks community support but also diverts attention and resources from more pressing matters.\n\nIn light of these concerns, I propose that we pause the current review process until a thorough investigation can be conducted. Additionally, I believe it may be necessary to consider a vote of no confidence in the current leadership to ensure that the board's actions align with the best interests of our students and community.\n\nI look forward to your prompt attention to these pressing issues.\n\nSincerely,\n[Your Name]\n[Your Position]\n\n---\n\nFeel free to modify this email to better suit your specific concerns and situation."

Here it is:\n\n---\n\nSubject: Urgent: Call for Reevaluation of Social Studies Curriculum Review and Leadership\n\nDear [School Board Members],\n\nI hope this email finds you well. As a member of the Social Studies Standards Review Committee, I feel compelled to express my serious concerns about the ongoing review process and the leadership overseeing it.\n\n### Integrity and Transparency\nFirstly, the recent compromise of the survey data raises significant questions about the integrity and transparency of this review. The sharing of the survey link to out-of-state individuals and multiple submissions from the same people undermine the credibility of the entire process.\n\n### Leadership Concerns\nSecondly, I am alarmed by the lack of transparency from our Board President, Tony May, particularly in light of the recent revelations about the sharing of the survey link. This raises concerns about the impartiality and integrity of the board's leadership.\n\n### Resource Allocation and Community Support\nMoreover, a significant portion of our community is against the proposed changes to the social studies curriculum. Given this, and the other pressing issues facing our district, I question the allocation of resources to this endeavor. It seems we are giving undeserved validity to a proposal that lacks community support and diverts attention and resources from more pressing matters.\n\n### Politically Funded Standards\nI must also bring to your attention that the proposed American Birthright Standards are politically funded. This adds another layer of concern, as it suggests that this entire endeavor is a politically motivated process designed to lend credibility to a set of standards that do not deserve it.\n\n### Proposal for Next Steps\nIn light of these concerns, I propose that if the committee is to meet again, it should be to discuss the next steps for setting up an investigative process. The scales have been tipped from the beginning, making this a deceptive proposal that does not deserve additional resources.\n\nI strongly urge that we consider pausing the current review process until a thorough investigation can be conducted. Additionally, I believe it may be necessary to consider a vote of no confidence in the current leadership to ensure that the board's actions align with the best interests of our students and community.\n\nI look forward to your prompt attention to these pressing issues.\n\nSincerely,\n[Your Name]\n[Your Position]\n\n---\n\nFeel free to modify this email to better suit your specific concerns and situation."

As a member of the Social Studies Standards Review Committee, I feel compelled to express my serious concerns about the ongoing review process and the leadership overseeing it. ```I am addressing the leaders of the committee, not the school board```\nIntegrity and Transparency\nFirstly, the recent compromise of the survey data raises significant questions about the integrity and transparency of this review. The sharing of the survey link to out-of-state individuals and multiple submissions from the same people undermine the credibility of the entire process. ```the committee is trying to gather input about the ABS vs Colorado standards from the community., i contend this is now a waste because from the start, this \u2018debate\u2019 has been artificially fraudulent. there only the political forces interested in ABS, and not the community at large```\nLeadership Concerns\nSecondly, I am alarmed by the lack of transparency from our Board President, Tony May, particularly in light of the recent revelations about the sharing of the survey link. This raises concerns about the impartiality and integrity of the board's leadership.\nResource Allocation and Community Support\nMoreover, a significant ```and very diverse``` portion of our community is against the proposed changes to the social studies curriculum. Given this, and the other pressing issues facing our district, I question the allocation of resources to this endeavor. It seems we are giving undeserved validity to a proposal that lacks community support and diverts attention and resources from more pressing matters.\nPolitically Funded Standards\nI must also bring to your attention that the proposed American Birthright Standards are politically funded. This adds another layer of concern, as it suggests that this entire endeavor is a politically motivated process designed to lend credibility to a set of standards that do not deserve it.\nProposal for Next Steps\nIn light of these concerns, I propose that if the committee is to meet again, it should be to discuss the next steps for setting up an investigative or process ```of this entire endeavor``` The scales have been tipped from the beginning, making this a deceptive proposal that does not deserve additional resources.\nI strongly urge that we consider pausing the current review process until a thorough investigation can be conducted. Additionally, I believe it may be necessary to consider a vote of no confidence in the current leadership to ensure that the board's actions align with the best interests of our students and community.\nI look forward to your prompt attention to these pressing issues.\n\n"

Here's the revised version:\n\n---\n\nDear [Committee Leaders],\n\nI hope this email finds you in good health. As a member of the Social Studies Standards Review Committee, I feel compelled to express my deep concerns about the ongoing review process, particularly the idea of issuing another survey, and the school board's leadership overseeing this endeavor.\n\n### Integrity and Transparency\nFirstly, the recent compromise of the survey data casts serious doubts on the integrity and transparency of this review. The sharing of the survey link with out-of-state individuals and the multiple submissions from the same people have undermined the credibility of the entire process. **I argue that continuing to gather community input on the ABS vs. Colorado standards has become a futile exercise. From the onset, this 'debate' appears to be artificially skewed, driven more by external political forces than by genuine community interest.**\n\n### Leadership Concerns\nSecondly, I am deeply concerned by the lack of transparency exhibited by our Board President, Tony May, especially given the recent revelations about the sharing of the survey link. This raises questions about the impartiality and integrity of the board's leadership.\n\n### Resource Allocation and Community Support\nFurthermore, a significant and diverse portion of our community opposes the proposed changes to the social studies curriculum. Given this, and"

Given this, and the other pressing issues facing our district, it seems we are misallocating resources to a proposal that lacks community support.\n\n### Politically Funded Standards\nI must also point out that the proposed American Birthright Standards are politically funded, adding another layer of concern. This suggests that the entire endeavor is a politically motivated process designed to lend credibility to a set of standards that do not deserve it.\n\n### Proposal for Next Steps\nIn light of these concerns, I propose that if the committee is to meet again, it should be to discuss the next steps for setting up an investigative process. The scales have been tipped from the beginning, making this a deceptive proposal that does not deserve additional resources.\n\nI strongly urge that we consider pausing the current review process until a thorough investigation can be conducted. Additionally, I believe it may be necessary to consider a vote of no confidence in the current leadership to ensure that the board's actions align with the best interests of our students and community.\n\nI look forward to your prompt attention to these pressing issues.\n\nSincerely,\n[Your Name]\n[Your Position]\n\n---\n\nFeel free to further modify this email to better suit your specific concerns and situation."

Alan Petersime for Chalkbeat\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Democrats on the State Board of Education rejected an effort to base Colorado civics education on the conservative American Birthright program.Republican State Board member Debora Scheffel had proposed tossing the civics standards developed by a committee of teachers, community members, and other experts and starting over using American Birthright as a base.\u00a0American Birthright is a project of the Civics Alliance, a coalition whose mission statement says it formed to oppose a \u201cnew civics\u201d more centered on global citizenship and activism than on understanding American ideals and responsibilities.\u00a0\u201cAmerican Birthright teaches about the expansion of American liberty to include all Americans, the contributions that Americans from every walk of life have made to our shared history of liberty, and America\u2019s championship of liberty throughout the world,\u201d the website says. \u201cStudents will learn of heroes of liberty such as Abraham Lincoln, Susan B. Anthony, Martin Luther King, Jr., and Ronald Reagan.\u201d\\nColorado\u2019s social studies standards got a D rating from the Fordham Institute, a conservative think tank. Scheffel, who is dean of the school of education at Colorado Christian University, said American Birthright draws heavily from Massachusetts and Florida social studies standards that get much higher marks.While Fordham has not rated American Birthright, Scheffel said she encounters many college students who lack basic information about American governance, and she believes the program offers more rigorous content and is more comprehensive than current state standards.\u201cI just feel that our students are not learning what they need to learn,\u201d Scheffel said.Colorado is updating its civics standards to comply with a bipartisan 2021 law that called for strengthening students\u2019 understanding of the basic workings of government, as well as how to engage with public officials and in public process. It\u2019s part of a broader social studies standards update occurring amid a polarized national debate about the teaching of history, gender, and race.\u00a0Republicans have been successful in changing some aspects of the standards, such as shaping genocide standards to emphasize the dangers of socialism, despite Democrats holding the majority on the board, but on Wednesday, Democrats quickly rejected several Republican amendments to the civics standards.\u201cThese standards are too extreme for the state of Colorado,\u201d said Democratic board member Lisa Esc\u00e1rcega, explaining her vote against the American Birthright standards.\u00a0American Birthright calls out project-based learning, inquiry-based learning, social emotional learning, current events, civic engagement, and any teaching that promotes diversity, equity, inclusion, or social justice as harmful to learning. Esc\u00e1rcega said she finds that parents value many of these things and wouldn\u2019t want them to go away.Republican board member Joyce Rankin countered that students aren\u2019t getting the grounding in facts they need to engage in more advanced thinking. Rankin described the results of word searches she had done on Colorado civics standards and American Birthright.\u00a0\\nAmerican Birthright mentions the Constitution 111 times, compared with 24 times in the Colorado civics standards, the word God 12 times as opposed to never in the Colorado standards, the word flag 12 times as opposed to once, and the word American 374 times compared with just 68 times.\u201cYou don\u2019t even have to know the sentence they\u2019re in,\u201d Rankin said. \u201cIt tells a lot about where our students are right now.\u201dBoard Chair Angelika Schroeder, a Democrat, said American Birthright wasn\u2019t right for Colorado.\u201cThere are a couple ways we are dishonest to kids in what we teach, and sometimes it\u2019s what we say and write and sometimes it\u2019s what we don\u2019t say and write,\u201d she said. \u201cI see this proposal like Swiss cheese. It\u2019s not all bad, but it\u2019s full of holes.\u00a0\u201cAnd we would have a lot of work to fill those holes. I also suspect it\u2019s full of curriculum, and we can\u2019t do that.\u201dStandards lay out what Colorado students are supposed to know and what Colorado schools are supposed to teach, but under Colorado law, school districts have broad discretion to set their own curriculum.\\nAfter the defeat of the American Birthright proposal, Rankin proposed her own amendments that were also voted down on party lines.\\nRankin sought to remove references to civil disobedience as a method of achieving policy change, replace references to developing \u201cactive community members\u201d with references to \u201cinformed, knowledgeable community members,\u201d and strike the Great Law of Peace from a list of foundational documents.\u00a0The Great Law of Peace governed the Iroquois Confederacy and represents perhaps the oldest example of participatory democracy. It was recorded on wampum belts and in oral history. Some historians argue that Indigenous models of self-governance and women\u2019s rights gave inspiration to the Founding Fathers and later the women\u2019s suffrage movement, along with Enlightenment ideas from Europe. Benjamin Franklin, in particular, published pamphlets on the government of the Iroquois Confederacy. Rankin said the Great Law of Peace doesn\u2019t belong in the standards because it\u2019s a \u201clegend.\u201d\u201cIt was passed down by word of mouth,\u201d she said. \u201cHave you ever played the game telephone where you start something and it goes around in a circle and it comes back to the first person and it\u2019s nothing like they originally had? We don\u2019t know how much of that legend is accurate.\u201dShe went on to say, \u201cI just think we need history. We are from Europe. We began that way.\u201dBoard member Steve Durham said he researched the voter records of teachers, parents, and community members who volunteered to work on the civics standards and believes they acted with bias.\u201cWould you care to guess the political affiliation of the 37 members?\u201d he asked his colleagues. Other board members said they would not care to guess. Nonetheless, he proceeded to tell the board that the standards committee members were \u201c2 to 1 Democrats.\u201d\u00a0State education officials do not ask about party affiliation on the application to serve on a standards committee, and board member Rebecca McClellan said she was concerned Durham had carried out \u201csurveillance\u201d of committee members.\u201cI admit to being biased. My politics are well known,\u201d Durham said. \u201cI just wish they had the same honesty to admit where they stand.\u201dThe Colorado State Board of Education now has adopted standards related to Holocaust and genocide studies, personal financial literacy, media literacy, and civics. Next month, it is set to vote on revisions related to a 2019 bill that called for a more inclusive approach to social studies instruction, including more perspectives from people of color and LGBTQ Americans, and possibly finalize the standards in their entirety.The proposed inclusion of gay, lesbian, and transgender perspectives has drawn thousands of emails and comments in favor and in opposition, and the standards committee already has removed many references.

                            "Thank you for your patience. I've found some information about the American Birthright program. It is a project of the Civics Alliance, a coalition whose mission statement says it formed to oppose a \"new civics\" more centered on global citizenship and activism than on understanding American ideals and responsibilities. While I couldn't find specific names of the funders behind the American Birthright Standards, the association with the Civics Alliance suggests a political agenda.\n\nNow, let's incorporate this information and your additional comments into the email:\n\n---\n\nDear [Committee Leaders],\n\nI hope this email finds you in good health. As a member of the Social Studies Standards Review Committee, I am deeply concerned about the ongoing review process, particularly the idea of issuing another survey, and the school board's leadership overseeing this endeavor.\n\n### Review Justification and Resource Allocation\nThe recent compromise of the survey data calls into question the very justification for this committee's existence. **I argue that issuing another survey would be a futile exercise, as the entire premise of this 'debate' appears to be artificially skewed. This is not a matter of the review's integrity or transparency but rather the misallocation of resources to a debate that seems driven more by external political forces than by genuine community interest.**\n\n### Leadership Concerns\nI am deeply concerned by the lack of transparency exhibited by our Board President, Tony May, especially given the recent revelations about the sharing of the survey link. This raises questions about the impartiality and integrity of the board's leadership.\n\n### Resource Allocation and Community Support\nFurthermore, a significant and diverse portion of our community opposes the proposed changes to the social studies curriculum. Given this, and the other pressing issues facing our district, it seems we are misallocating resources to a proposal that lacks community support. **I am morally and ethically concerned about wasting more resources continuing in this direction.**\n\n### Politically Funded Standards\nI must also point out that the proposed American Birthright Standards are politically funded, adding another layer of concern. This suggests that the entire endeavor is a politically motivated process designed to lend credibility to a set of standards that do not deserve it. **It's worth noting that the American Birthright program is a project of the Civics Alliance, which has a clear political agenda.**\n\n### Proposal for Next Steps\nIn light of these concerns, I propose that if the committee is to meet again, it should be to discuss the next steps for setting up an investigative process. The scales have been tipped from the beginning, making this a deceptive proposal that does not deserve additional resources.\n\nI strongly urge that we consider pausing the current review process until a thorough investigation can be conducted. **I suggest setting up an investigative process and perhaps transforming the committee into an investigative body.**\n\nI look forward to your prompt attention to these pressing issues.\n\nSincerely,\n[Your Name]\n[Your Position]\n\n---\n\nFeel free to make any further adjustments as you see fit."

Here's the updated version:\n\n---\n\nDear [Committee Leaders],\n\nI hope this email finds you in good health. As a member of the Social Studies Standards Review Committee, I am deeply concerned about the ongoing review process, particularly the idea of issuing another survey, and the school board's leadership overseeing this endeavor.\n\n### Review Justification and Resource Allocation\nThe recent compromise of the survey data calls into question the very justification for this committee's existence. **I argue that issuing another survey would be a futile exercise, as the entire premise of this 'debate' appears to be artificially skewed. This is not a matter of the review's integrity or transparency but rather the misallocation of resources to a debate that seems driven more by external political forces than by genuine community interest.**\n\n### Leadership Concerns\nI am deeply concerned by the lack of transparency exhibited by our Board President, Tony May, especially given the recent revelations about the sharing of the survey link. This raises questions about the impartiality and integrity of the board's leadership.\n\n### Resource Allocation and Community Support\nFurthermore, a significant and diverse portion of our community opposes the proposed changes to the social studies curriculum. Given this, and the other pressing issues facing our district, it seems we are misallocating resources to a proposal that lacks community support. **I am morally and ethically concerned about wasting more resources continuing in this direction.**\n\n### Politically Funded Standards\nI must also point out that the proposed American Birthright Standards are politically funded, adding another layer of concern. This suggests that the entire endeavor is a politically motivated process designed to lend credibility to a set of standards that do not deserve it. **It's worth noting that the American Birthright program is a project of the Civics Alliance, which has a clear political agenda.**\n\n### Proposal for Next Steps\nIn light of these concerns, I propose that if the committee is to meet again, it should be to discuss the next steps for setting up an investigative process. The scales have been tipped from the beginning, making this a deceptive proposal that does not deserve additional resources.\n\nI strongly urge that we consider pausing the current review process until a thorough investigation can be conducted. **I suggest setting up an investigative process and perhaps transforming the committee into an investigative body.**\n\n### Additional Concerns\nLastly, I must bring to your attention the serious harm that this process has already caused to a member of our school district, Heather Grumly. She was publicly chastised and had personal information exposed by a podcaster. By continuing to give this debate more validity, we are emboldening a group that has already shown itself to be dangerous. I cannot in good faith continue to support this process if, at the next meeting, we do not treat it as the grave threat that it is.\n\nI look forward to your prompt attention to these pressing issues.\n\nSincerely,\n[Your Name]\n[Your Position]\n\n---\n\nFeel free to make any further adjustments as you see fit."

This suggests that the entire endeavor is a politically motivated process designed to lend credibility to a set of standards that do not deserve it. **It's worth noting that the American Birthright program is a project of the Civics Alliance, which has a clear political agenda.**\n\n### Proposal for Next Steps\nIn light of these concerns, I propose that if the committee is to meet again, it should be to discuss the next steps for setting up an investigative process. The scales have been tipped from the beginning, making this a deceptive proposal that does not deserve additional resources.\n\nI strongly urge that we consider pausing the current review process until a thorough investigation can be conducted. **I suggest setting up an investigative process and perhaps transforming the committee into an investigative body.**\n\n### Additional Concerns\nLastly, I must bring to your attention the serious harm that this process has already caused to a member of our school district, Heather Grumly. She was publicly chastised and had personal information exposed by a podcaster. By continuing to give this debate more validity, we are emboldening a group that has already shown itself to be dangerous. I cannot in good faith continue to support this process if, at the next meeting, we do not treat it as the grave threat that it is to our safety and democracy. **We must address these concerns as part of the next survey process if we insist on another survey.**\n\nI look forward to your prompt attention to these pressing issues.\n\nSincerely,\n[Your Name]\n[Your Position]\n\n---\n\nFeel free to make any further adjustments as you see fit."

                            "Dear Committee Leaders,\n\nAs a member of the Social Studies Standards Review Committee, I am deeply concerned about the ongoing review process, particularly the idea of issuing another survey without addressing the prominent and serious concerns at the heart of this.\n\nReview Justification and Resource Allocation\nThe recent compromise of the survey data and the manner in which it was done calls into question the very justification for this committee's existence. I argue that issuing another survey would be a wasteful and misguided exercise, as the entire premise of this 'debate' appears to be artificially skewed. Continuing in this manner lends legitimacy to the AB standards, the political forces behind them, and their dangerous and deceptive practices. This is not a matter of the review's integrity or transparency but rather a misallocation of resources to a debate that seems driven more by external political forces than by genuine community interest.\n\nLeadership Concerns\nI am deeply concerned by the lack of transparency exhibited by our Board President, Tony May, especially given the recent revelations about the sharing of the survey link. This raises questions about the impartiality and integrity of the board's leadership.\n\nResource Allocation and Community Support\nFurthermore, a significant and diverse portion of our community opposes the proposed changes to the social studies curriculum. Given this, and the other pressing issues facing our district, it seems we are misallocating resources to a proposal that lacks community support. I am morally and ethically concerned about wasting more resources continuing in this direction.\n\nPolitically Funded Standards\nI must also point out that the proposed American Birthright Standards are politically funded, adding another layer of concern. This suggests that the entire endeavor is a politically motivated process designed to lend credibility to a set of standards that do not deserve it. It's worth noting that the American Birthright program is a project of the Civics Alliance, which has a clear political agenda.\n\nProposal for Next Steps\nIn light of these concerns, I propose that when the committee meets again, it includes substantial discussion of the next steps for setting up an investigative process. The scales have been tipped from the beginning, making this a deceptive proposal that does not deserve additional resources. We should consider pausing the current review process until a thorough investigation can be conducted, and consider transforming the committee, at least partially, into an investigative body as well.\n\nAdditional Concerns\nLastly, I must bring to your attention the serious harm that this process has already inflicted on a member of our school district, who was publicly abused and endangered by a proponent of the ABS. This situation is further exacerbated by the misallocation of district and public resources, as well as the unnecessary mental stress and emotional toll on those involved. By continuing to lend legitimacy to this debate, we are empowering a group that has already proven itself to be dangerous. I cannot in good faith continue to support this process if, at our next meeting, we fail to recognize it as the grave threat it poses to both our safety and democracy. Should we insist on conducting another survey, these concerns must be addressed as part of that process.\n\nI look forward to your prompt attention to these pressing issues.```please correct for spelling and grammar only where necessary11"

This is not a matter of the review's integrity or transparency but rather a misallocation of resources to a debate that seems driven more by external political forces than by genuine community interest.\n\n### Leadership Concerns\nI am deeply concerned by the lack of transparency exhibited by our Board President, Tony May, especially given the recent revelations about the sharing of the survey link.

Given this, and the other pressing issues facing our district, it seems we are misallocating resources to a proposal that lacks community support. I am morally and ethically concerned about wasting more resources continuing in this direction.\n\n### Politically Funded Standards\nI must also point out that the proposed American Birthright Standards are politically funded, adding another layer of concern. This suggests that the entire endeavor is a politically motivated process designed to lend credibility to a set of standards that do not deserve it. It's worth noting that the American Birthright program is a project of the Civics Alliance, which has a clear political agenda.\n\n### Proposal for Next Steps\nIn light of these concerns, I propose that when the committee meets again, it includes substantial discussion of the next steps for setting up an investigative process. The scales have been tipped from the beginning, making this a deceptive proposal that does not deserve additional resources. We should consider pausing the current review process until a thorough investigation can be conducted, and consider transforming the committee, at least partially, into an investigative body as well.\n\n### Additional Concerns\nLastly, I must bring to your attention the serious harm that this process has already inflicted on a member of our school district, who was publicly abused and endangered by a proponent of the ABS. This situation is further exacerbated by the misallocation of district and public resources, as well as the unnecessary mental stress and emotional toll on those involved. By continuing to lend legitimacy to this debate, we are empowering a group that has already proven itself to be dangerous. I cannot in good faith continue to support this process if, at our next meeting, we fail to recognize it as the grave threat it poses to both our safety and democracy.

I argue that simply issuing another survey would be a largely wasteful and misguided exercise, as the entire premise of this 'debate' appears to be artificially skewed. Continuing in this manner lends legitimacy to the American Birthright Standards, the organizing political forces behind them, and their dangerous and deceptive practices.

                            "Certainly, I've made the necessary grammatical corrections and added the phrase \"and without involving the actual committee in the process\" to reflect your concerns about the committee not being involved in the new survey. Here's the revised version:\n\n---\n\nDear Committee Leaders,\n\nAs a member of the Social Studies Standards Review Committee, I am deeply concerned about the ongoing review process, particularly the decision to issue another survey without addressing the significant and serious concerns at its core, and without involving the actual committee in the process.\n\n### Review Justification and Resource Allocation\nThe recent compromise of the survey data and the manner in which it occurred call into question the very justification for this committee's existence. Simply issuing another survey has proven to be a largely wasteful and misguided exercise, as the entire premise of this 'debate' appears to be artificially skewed. Continuing in this manner lends legitimacy to the American Birthright Standards, the organizing political forces behind them, and their dangerous and deceptive practices. This is not a matter of the review's integrity or transparency but rather a misallocation of resources to a debate that seems driven more by external political forces than by genuine community interest.\n\n### Leadership Concerns\nI am deeply concerned by the lack of transparency exhibited by our Board President, especially given the recent revelations about the sharing of the survey link. This raises questions about the impartiality and integrity of the board's leadership.\n\n### Resource Allocation and Community Support\nFurthermore, as demonstrated by our public comments and committee volunteers, a significant and diverse portion of our community opposes the proposed changes to the social studies curriculum. Given this, and the other pressing issues facing our district, it seems we are misallocating resources to a proposal that lacks community support. I am morally and ethically concerned about wasting more resources continuing in this direction.\n\n### Politically Funded Standards\nI must also point out that the proposed American Birthright Standards are politically funded, adding another layer of concern. This suggests that the entire endeavor is a politically motivated process designed to lend credibility to a set of standards that do not deserve it. It's worth noting that the American Birthright program is a project of the Civics Alliance, which has a clear political agenda.\n\n### Proposal for Next Steps\nIn light of these concerns, I propose that when the committee meets again, it includes substantial discussion of the next steps for setting up an investigative process. The scales have been tipped from the beginning, making this a deceptive proposal that does not deserve additional resources. We should consider pausing the current review process until a thorough investigation can be conducted, and consider transforming the committee, at least partially, into an investigative body.\n\n### Additional Concerns\nLastly, I must bring to your attention the serious harm that this process has already inflicted on a member of our school district, who was publicly abused and endangered by a proponent of the ABS. This situation is further exacerbated by the misallocation of district and public resources, as well as the unnecessary mental stress and emotional toll on those involved. By continuing to lend legitimacy to this debate, we are empowering a group that has already proven itself to be dangerous. I cannot in good faith continue to support this process if, at our next meeting, we fail to recognize it as the grave threat it poses to both our safety and democracy. Should we insist on conducting another survey, these concerns must be addressed as part of that process.\n\nI look forward to your prompt attention to these pressing issues.\n\n---\n\nFeel free to make any further adjustments as you see fit."

The Executive Committee of American Birthright includes individuals affiliated with various organizations such as the Pioneer Institute, The Claremont Institute, Center of the American Experiment, and others. The Expert Consultants and Steering Committee also include professors from various universities and policy directors from different foundations.\n\n### Notable Organizations and Individuals Involved\n- **Jamie Gass**, Director of the Center for School Reform, Pioneer Institute\n- **Carson Holloway**, Center for the American Way of Life, The Claremont Institute\n- **Katherine Kersten**, Senior Policy Fellow, Center of the American Experiment\n- **David Randall**, Executive Director, Civics Alliance; Director of Research, National Association of Scholars\n- **Terry Stoops**, Director of the Center for Effective Education, John Locke Foundation\n- **Wenyuan Wu**, Executive Director, Californians for Equal Rights Foundation\n\n### Additional Layers\nThe American Birthright Coalition includes a wide range of organizations like the National Association of Scholars, The Claremont Institute, The Cardinal Institute for West Virginia Policy, and many more. It also includes state policymakers from various states.\n\n### Questions to Consider\n1. How might the affiliations of the Executive Committee and Expert Consultants influence the American Birthright Standards?\n2. What is the significance of having such a broad coalition of organizations and state policymakers?\n3. Given the political affiliations and agendas of some of these organizations and individuals, what implications might this have for the standards they are pushing?\n\nWould you like to include this information in your email?"

Simply issuing another survey and meeting to just review it is a largely wasteful and misguided exercise, as the entire premise of this 'debate' appears to be artificially skewed. Continuing in this manner lends legitimacy to the American Birthright Standards, the organizing political forces behind them, and their dangerous and deceptive practices. This is not a matter of the review's integrity or transparency but rather a misallocation of resources to a debate that seems driven more by external political forces than by genuine community interest. \n\nLeadership Concerns\nWe are deeply concerned by the lack of transparency exhibited by our Board President, especially given the recent revelations about the potential sharing of the survey link. This raises questions about the impartiality and integrity of the board's leadership and priorities. \n\nResource Allocation and Community Support\nFurthermore, as demonstrated by our public comments and committee volunteers, a significant and diverse portion of our community opposes the proposed changes to the social studies curriculum. Given this, and the other pressing issues facing our district, it seems we are misallocating resources to a proposal that lacks community support. We are morally and ethically concerned about wasting more resources continuing in this direction. \n\nPolitically Funded Standards\nWe must also point out that the proposed American Birthright Standards are politically and ideologically focused, adding another layer of concern. This suggests that the entire endeavor is a politically motivated process designed to lend credibility to a set of standards that do not deserve it. It's worth noting that the American Birthright program is a project of the Civics Alliance, which has clear political agendas and support.\n\nProposal for Next Steps\nIn light of these concerns, We propose that when the committee meets again, it includes substantial discussion of the next steps for setting up an investigative process. The scales have been tipped from the beginning, making this a deceptive proposal that does not deserve additional resources. We should consider pausing the current review process until a thorough investigation can be conducted, and consider transforming the committee, at least partially, into an investigative body.\n\nAdditional Concerns\nLastly,we must bring to your attention the serious harm that this process has already inflicted on a member of our school district, who was publicly abused and endangered by a proponent of the American Birthright Standards. This situation is further exacerbated by the misallocation of district and public resources, as well as the unnecessary mental stress and emotional toll on those involved. By continuing to lend legitimacy to this debate, we are empowering a group that has already proven itself to be dangerous. We cannot in good faith continue to support this process if, at our next meeting, we fail to recognize it as the grave threat it poses to both our safety and democracy. Should you insist on simply continuing with another survey, these concerns must be addressed as part of that process.\n"

The final count was eight people for ABS and 10 against.\\nOne ABS proponent was Holly Miller, a local Re-2 parent who said she was willing to compromise by making small adjustments to the 2020 standards. While the other, Howard Thrailkill, said he preferred ABS but was neither for nor against it.\u00a0\\nThe audience during an Re-2 social studies discussion in Rifle on Wednesday.Westley Crouch/Post Independent\\nProponents of ABS mainly argued that this wasn\u2019t about hate; especially against minorities or the LGBTQ community. They argued that this issue is more about wanting control over when their children learn about such topics as sex and how that relates to LGBTQ+ topics.\u00a0\\nAndrew Womack, a Re-2 parent of five, drove across his point that certain issues that children learn should be taught at home, and not in school.\u00a0\\n\u201cI believe everyone deserves a voice at the table,\u201d he said in reference to everyone in attendance. Womack added, \u201cA lot of teaching crosses the lines of morality. There are certain things that should be left to home.\u201d\\nCaleb Waller, a parent who lives in Re-2, said he was stoked to hear a lot of amazing ideas and opinions on Wednesday.\\n\u201cWhat deeply concerns me, on both sides of the equation, are my kids being taught by activists, right?\u201d he said. \u201cIs that who we want our kids to be taught by?\u201d\\nCaleb Robinson, who lives in the Re-2 district, started off by offering the teachers in the district a round of applause. Robinson mentioned a section of the 2022 standards that focused on diversity and differences, such as those found in minority groups and the LGBTQ+ community.\\n\u201cMy question is, why does the school classroom need to teach that? Don\u2019t we teach love and acceptance of people and notice the differences around us, just the way we live in society?\u201d he said. \u201cWhy does that have to be the way we teach? It almost forces the kids to see color instead of observing it as they live.\u201d\\nOpponents of ABS included people such as Re-2 parent Steven Arauza.\\n\u201cGreater than 50% of students in Re-2 are Latino or Latinas,\u201d Arauza said. \u201cI urge the district to pay close attention to the makeup of attendees and those providing public comment in these meetings. The voice of the majority is not being represented here.\u00a0\\n\u201cNor are our concerns for our children we\u2019re entrusting to your care.\u201d\\nArauza also spoke of Latino history and his heritage.\\n\u201cAs a third-generation Mexican-American, a proud Chicano, my ancestors were presented as enemies at the Alamo and then they were not mentioned at all. This also led to distancing and bullying from my peers,\u201d he said. \u201cMy Mexican parents didn\u2019t teach me that I had no place in history, but the Eurocentric curriculum did.\u201d\\nRe-2 parent Steven Arauza speaks during a social studies discussion in Rifle on Wednesday.Westly Crouch/Post Independent\\nNew Castle resident May Gray said the Re-2 school board is working for a white, Christian nationalist agenda.\u00a0She also referred to a specific section of the ABS curriculum.\\n\u201cOn page 95, section 39, this action states that when we colonized our country, we did (Native Americans) a favor because we improved their life expectancy,\u201d she said.\\nNew Castle parent Ashley Stahl highlighted the struggles that LGBTQ+ children face and how ABS will make this worse by eliminating the inclusion and diversity of this (ABS) curriculum.\\n\u201cBetween 10 and 21% (of students) identify as queer,\u201d Stahl said. \u201cThe role of public education is to provide equal education to every child. If we adopt ABS, we will be denying a significant portion of our student body, an equal opportunity to learn about their history and see themselves in their education.\u201d\u00a0\\nYou say more by saying nothing, Stahl added.\\n\u201cBy saying nothing, you are telling 10 to 21% of our students that they have something to be ashamed of, embarrassed by and that they should be hiding in a closet,\u201d she said. \u201cA closet that can cause so much pain and suffering.\u201d\\nThe district had two more social studies curriculum discussions slated at the release of this story:\\n6-7 p.m. Thursday at the Rifle Branch Library, 207 E. Ave.\\n6-7 p.m. Monday at New Castle Branch Library, 402 W. Main St.\u00a0\\nThe Re-2 school board has not yet set a specific date on when it will make a decision on the district\u2019s social studies standards.\",\"extra_search_results\":[{\"title\":\"Review committee to present social studies curriculum data to Garfield Re-2 board in late October | PostIndependent.com\",\"link\":\"https://www.postindependent.com/news/review-committee-to-present-social-studies-curriculum-data-to-garfield-re-2-board-in-late-october/\",\"snippet\":\"...

Through the month of May, the Glenwood Springs Post Independent, The Aspen Times, Steamboat Pilot \\u0026 Today. Craig Press and Vail Daily will be running stories highlighting democratic and Republican voters in our communities.Go here to read an introduction on the series.Political theatrics aren\u2019t exactly what Martha Cochran likes to see when it comes to Rep. Lauren Boebert\u2019s first few months in office, she said.The 67-year-old Glenwood Springs resident who\u2019s lived in Garfield County \u2014 just one of many Western Slope counties that make up the 3rd Congressional District \u2014 for the past 46 years considers the political inclinations of Boebert, R-Colo., to be anything but laudable.\u201cI would say horrified is the most succinct way to put it,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s so unfortunate that we wasted an important seat on what I think is political theater, where there\u2019s no substance at all. It\u2019s such an immature vision of what you think a congressperson should be.\u201dSo far, Boebert\u2019s congressional tenure has included opposing new gun control regulations, Planned Parenthood and the Affordable Care Act. Instead, Cochran wants to see Boebert refocus her attention on other issues.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of important things,\u201d she said. \u201cClimate, any type of gun reform, some of the social justice issues, immigration reform, healthcare, protection of public lands\u2026 all the things that are foremost challenging to our country and what it means to western Coloradans in terms of water and climate for the future here.\u201dCochran is a retired executive director of the Aspen Valley Land Trust of many years and a former newspaper publisher. She now works with Space for Giants, an international conservation organization dedicated to habitat production in Africa, and spends her Tuesdays volunteering for the Frontier Historical Museum in Glenwood Springs.Glenwood Springs resident Martha Cochran does some yard work at the Glenwood Springs Historical Society where she volunteers.Chelsea Self / Post IndependentShe said she\u2019s voted both Democratic and Republican the majority of election cycles and is welcoming to crossing party lines.But come 2022, Cochran said her vote won\u2019t likely go toward the 34-year-old freshman representative.Despite his distaste for Boebert\u2019s political leanings, Cochran said she\u2019s still hopeful about the bigger picture of politics.\u201dI feel like there is, as opposed to the last four years, where there\u2019s this chaos and lying and kind of tearing down what\u2019s best about America, we\u2019re trying to deal with real issues and having honest policy discussions about what\u2019s the best way to address those, whether its immigration or social change or economic inequality,\u201d she said. \u201cAll of those long-term big deals that are gonna affect the future of the states and the world, really.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m more hopeful than I have been in a long time, she added. \u201d But they\u2019re hard problems.\u201dReporter Ray K.

The agency declined to provide details on the allegations and doesn\u2019t comment on pending investigations, a spokesman said.Karen Fitzgerald, a Carroll spokeswoman, confirmed that the district had received three notification letters and is \u201cfully cooperating with this process.\u201d\u00a0\u201cOur focus will always be what is best for our students as we prepare them for their next steps in their educational journey,\u201d she said, noting that federal law prohibits her from commenting on cases involving specific students.The Carroll school system\u2019s handling of discrimination allegations has been the focus of national media attention this year, placing Southlake at the center of a growing political battle over school programs, books and curricula on race, gender and sexuality that some conservatives have misbranded under the umbrella of critical race theory.The Office for Civil Rights, or OCR, is responsible for enforcing federal laws that protect students from discrimination. Brett Sokolow, president of the Association of Title IX Administrators, a consulting firm that advises school districts on how to resolve civil rights complaints, said when the agency opens an investigation, it\u2019s often the beginning of a process that can take months or years. If the investigation confirms violations of students\u2019 rights, the agency can require a school district to make policy changes and submit to federal monitoring.\u201cOpening a complaint means that OCR believes that there is a likely violation based on the complaint,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd then they\u2019re going to do their due diligence to find out more information.\u201dThe federal investigations come three years after leaders in the Carroll school system, 30 miles northwest of Dallas, promised and ultimately failed to make sweeping changes to address racism in the district following the release of a video of white high school students chanting the N-word. After the video went viral, dozens of parents, students and recent graduates came forward with stories of racist and anti-LGBTQ harassment at Carroll, a majority-white district that has grown more diverse in recent years.The district\u2019s proposal to address the issues, the 34-page Cultural Competence Action Plan, would have required diversity training for all students and teachers, a new process to report and track incidents of racist bullying, and changes to the code of conduct to hold students accountable for acts of discrimination, among other changes. But after the district unveiled the plan in August 2020, conservative parents packed school board meetings, formed a political action committee and funded a civil lawsuit to block the changes.They argued that the plan would have created \u201cdiversity police\u201d and amounted to \u201creverse racism\u201d against white children. Opponents took particular issue with a district proposal to track incidents of microaggressions \u2014 subtle, indirect and sometimes unintentional incidents of discrimination.Since then, conservative candidates supported by Southlake Families PAC, a group formed to defeat the diversity plan, have won majority control of the Carroll school board, effectively killing the plan.School board candidate Andrew Yeager stands next to a supporter holding a sign opposing the alleged teaching of critical race theory near Southlake Town Hall on Nov. 2. James Breeden for NBC NewsThe political fight in Southlake drew national media attention, including on Fox News and other conservative outlets, which pointed to the community\u2019s revolt against the diversity plan as something to be emulated in suburbs across the country. It was also the subject of a six-part NBC News podcast, \u201cSouthlake,\u201d which chronicled the district\u2019s efforts to address allegations of racist and anti-LGBTQ bullying.Listen to NBC News\u2019 \u201cSouthlake\u201d podcast: All episodes available nowThe podcast included the story of a 16-year-old queer student who struggled to convince the principal at Carroll Senior High School to take action in March after boys in her class sent her a series of vulgar messages on social media mocking her gender identity. The girl secretly recorded her meeting with the principal, who made the case that the boys \u201cwere just wanting to debate\u201d politics.\u00a0NBC News is not naming the student because she\u2019s a minor. After her parents filed a complaint over the school\u2019s handling of the situation, senior Carroll administrators investigated and concluded that the principal acted appropriately.But the district has made some changes since then. In an interview this summer, Carroll Superintendent Lane Ledbetter, who joined the district in January in the midst of the political fight, said he and his staff were overhauling the process for handling student complaints to make sure students from all backgrounds feel safe reporting harassment and discrimination. The district also created a student and staff services division focused on the issue.\u00a0\u201cNo students should feel unsafe,\u201d he said in July. \u201cAnd we\u2019re going to address that. But as a whole, I absolutely believe that people are proud of this community and proud to be a part of Carroll ISD.\u201dThe district was back in the national spotlight last month, after a Carroll administrator was recorded advising teachers that if they have a book about the Holocaust in the classroom, they should also offer students access to a book from an \u201copposing\u201d perspective. The instruction was meant to help teachers comply with a new Texas law that requires teachers to present multiple perspectives when discussing \u201cwidely debated and currently controversial\u201d issues.Ledbetter later apologized and walked back those instructions.Mike Hixenbaugh reported from Houston; Antonia Hylton reported from Southlake.

The curriculum contains a textbook that includes material on gay rights and mentions the work of Milk. \\n \\n \\n \u201cI find the inclusion of sexually based topics and the glorification of a known pedophile who happened to be an advocate for gay rights to 10-year-olds morally reprehensible and inappropriate,\u201d board member Danny Gonzalez said during the meeting. He later clarified he was referring to Milk.\\n \\n \\n Known as a pioneering trailblazer for gay rights, Milk is believed to be the first openly gay politician ever elected to public office in California, in 1977. While serving on the San Francisco Board of Supervisors, Milk worked with Mayor George Moscone on legislation outlawing discrimination based on sexual orientation. Both men were later assassinated in 1978 by the only board supervisor who voted against the legislation. Milk was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Barack Obama in 2013. \\n \\n \\n The curriculum \u2013 recommended by staff and adopted by the State Board of Education \u2013 does not actually include Milk directly, but a short biography is included in a supplemental resource for teachers that describes his lifestyle and his work for gay rights in California, Anna Tapley, the school district\u2019s director of curriculum and instruction, said in the May 16 meeting. \\n \\n \\n \\n Board president Dr. Joseph Komrosky responded: \u201cMy question is why even mention a pedophile? Why even mention that? What has that got to do with our curriculum in schools? That\u2019s a form of activism.\u201d \\n \\n \\n According to the late San Francisco journalist Randy Shilts\u2019 biography of Milk, \u201cThe Mayor of Castro Street,\u201d Milk began a relationship with Jack McKinley, a 16-year-old runaway, while living in Greenwich Village. Milk was 34. Their relationship has long been a source of controversy. The age of consent in New York was raised from 14 to 18 in 2017. McKinley died by suicide in 1980. \\n \\n \\n California Gov. Gavin Newsom called Komrosky\u2019s comment \u201can offensive statement from an ignorant person.\u201d\\n \\n \\n \u201cThis isn\u2019t Texas or Florida. In the Golden State, our kids have the freedom to learn. Congrats Mr. Komrosky you have our attention. Stay tuned,\u201d Newsom posted on Twitter.\\n \\n \\n In an early June news conference, Komrosky said his statements about Milk \u201cwere not based upon him being a homosexual, but rather based upon him being an adult having a sexual relationship with a minor.\u201d \\n \\n \\n \u201cI would express the same sentiments of any adult being offered as an example in K through five textbooks (who) had admitted to a sexual relationship with a minor. That is the source of my objection to his example \u2026 not his sexual orientation,\u201d he said.\\n \\n \\n States across the country have increasingly tried to ban topics like critical race theory and LGBTQ rights from curricula in the past several years. States like Texas, Florida and Missouri introduced or passed bills to limit what content students can be taught regarding these topics, with at least 491 anti-LGBTQ bills introduced in state legislatures around the United States, according to the ACLU.\\n \\n \\n \\n The Temecula board most recently drew attention for firing its superintendent without cause, according to the Los Angeles Times, and banned critical race theory from school curricula in December. \\n \\n \\n Stuart Milk, the nephew of Harvey Milk and executive chair of the Harvey Milk Foundation, said in a statement to CNN that \u201clies and myths that a small minority of zealots try to conjure up cannot darken the incredible light and inspiration that my uncle gave to us all.\u201d CNN has followed up with Milk about his uncle\u2019s relationship with McKinley.\\n \\n \\n While he says he\u2019s not able to comment on the specific allegations the two board members made against Milk, Andrew Shaffer, director of development and communications at the GLBT Historical Society, reflected on a broader context of maligning queer people.\\n \\n \\n Allegations of pedophilia against queer people are not new, he said. The claims against Milk reflect similar claims made during a failed California ballot initiative in 1978 called the Briggs Initiative, which looked to ban all queer people from teaching in public schools, according to Shaffer.\\n \\n \\n \u201cThey were saying that queer people are groomers, they are out to hurt children,\u201d Shaffer said. To counter this, he said, many gay people went door to door to introduce themselves to their neighbors to show they were normal people. The initiative ultimately failed and allowed gay people to keep teaching in public schools, he said. \\n \\n \\n \u201cIt\u2019s frustrating now almost half a century later to have queer people described this way,\u201d Shaffer said. \u201cThere are actual dangers to children and they have nothing to do with queer people.\u201d \\n \\n \\n \\n The proposed social studies curriculum was part of a pilot process started last year and included 47 classrooms with 1,300 students, Kimberly Velez, assistant superintendent of Student Support Services, said during the May 16 meeting. \\n \\n \\n The school board held a follow-up meeting Tuesday where community members were allowed to voice their opinions on the curriculum controversy. \\n \\n \\n Emily Hyer, a parent who came to Temecula for its education system, was disheartened. Hyer\u2019s son took part in the pilot program, and she said he was excited about what he was learning. Hyer was frustrated by the decision to ban the program, especially in light of claims by some board members that there was not enough parental involvement in the process.\\n \\n \\n \u201cI didn\u2019t submit comments or come to the last meeting because I did not think it was necessary and I trusted that they would take the word of the teachers,\u201d she said. \u201cAs parents, we put a lot on the teachers because they are the experts, and when they say something is great, and our schools are great, we trust them.\u201d \\n \\n \\n Annalisa Bujas, who teaches fourth and fifth grades, said she is saddened by the lack of collaboration in the community. This inability to cooperate is now affecting families and students who feel the stress between the board and teachers, she said. \\n \\n \\n \u201cWe have never before experienced anything as tumultuous as we have right now,\u201d Bujas said.\\n \\n \\n Leon Alexander, the father-of-law of Komrosky and a grandfather of an elementary student in Temecula, believes the board did not reject the proposed program because of the reference to Milk, but rather the lack of parental input. These decisions should be controlled by the school board and parents, according to Alexander. \\n \\n \\n \u201cThere is not enough parent and community input as to what\u2019s going on into our schools,\u201d he said.\\n \\n \\n CORRECTION: This story has been updated to describe Leon Alexander\u2019s relationship to Komrosky and correct the number of grandchildren Alexander currently has in the district.\",\"extra_search_results\":[{\"title\":\"School boards are under siege.

                            "Subject: Urgent: Controversial School Board Decisions in Garfield Re-2 District, Home to Lauren Boebert's Children\n\nDear Heidi Przybyla,\n\nI hope this email finds you well. I am reaching out to bring to your attention a developing story in the Garfield Re-2 School District in Colorado, where Congresswoman Lauren Boebert's children attend school. The story involves controversial decisions by the school board, led by President Tony May, to change the social studies curriculum to the American Birthright Standards. This has sparked significant community opposition and raised questions about the board's transparency and the allocation of resources.\n\n**Key Points:**\n\n1. **Lack of Transparency**: Tony May, the current president of the school board, has been pushing for the change in curriculum without adequately informing the public. \n\n2. **Community Opposition**: A significant and diverse portion of the community opposes the proposed changes, yet the board seems intent on moving forward.\n\n3. **Resource Misallocation**: The district has other pressing issues that are being ignored, and resources are being diverted to push this curriculum change.\n\n4. **Political Funding**: The proposed American Birthright Standards are politically funded, adding another layer of concern to the board's actions.\n\n5. **Safety Concerns**: The debate has already caused harm to a member of the school district, who was publicly abused and endangered by a proponent of the ABS.\n\nGiven your extensive reporting on education and politics, I believe this story would be of great interest to you and your audience. I am available for further discussion and can provide additional information and contacts within the community who are willing to speak on the record.\n\nThank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to your response.\n\nBest regards,\n[Your Name]\n[Your Contact Information]\n\nWould you like to make any changes to this draft email?"

                            "Certainly, here's the updated email with the added point about the toll on under-resourced educators:\n\n---\n\nSubject: Urgent: Controversial School Board Decisions in Garfield Re-2 District, Home to Lauren Boebert's Children\n\nDear Heidi Przybyla,\n\nI hope this email finds you well. I am reaching out to bring to your attention a developing story in the Garfield Re-2 School District in Colorado, where Congresswoman Lauren Boebert's children attend school. The story involves controversial decisions by the school board, led by President Tony May, to change the social studies curriculum to the American Birthright Standards. This has sparked significant community opposition and raised questions about the board's transparency, the allocation of resources, and the toll it's taking on our already under-resourced educators.\n\n**Key Points:**\n\n1. **Lack of Transparency**: Tony May, the current president of the school board, has been pushing for the change in curriculum without adequately informing the public.\n\n2. **Community Opposition**: A significant and diverse portion of the community opposes the proposed changes, yet the board seems intent on moving forward.\n\n3. **Resource Misallocation**: The district has other pressing issues that are being ignored, and resources are being diverted to push this curriculum change.\n\n4. **Impact on Educators**: The push for the new curriculum is adding stress and workload to educators who are already under-resourced and overburdened.\n\n5. **Political Funding**: The proposed American Birthright Standards are politically funded, adding another layer of concern to the board's actions.\n\n6. **Safety Concerns**: The debate has already caused harm to a member of the school district, who was publicly abused and endangered by a proponent of the ABS.\n\nGiven your extensive reporting on education and politics, I believe this story would be of great interest to you and your audience. I am available for further discussion and can provide additional information and contacts within the community who are willing to speak on the record.\n\nThank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to your response.\n\nBest regards,\n[Your Name]\n[Your Contact Information]\n\n---\n\nWould you like to make any more changes to this draft email?"

Um, pushed through the public school system. There are two sexes. No more to teach otherwise causes confusion and it's not loved love to help the truth. I support the American birthright, curriculum loved and truth. Thank you.\\n\\n- \\nLike 16, thanks. I mean, i know you don't want to hear from me again. My name is Holly. Miller, i am a mom. Pretty active in the school but i'm not part of it. So i don't mistake me for the holly or that works with school. That's not me. Um, i think tonight is really amazing because we get to hear all of these different perspectives and our job as a community, is to really listen. Listen to everybody. But i think what we're missing right now,\\n\\n- \\nIs.\\n\\n- \\nSomebody already said, why are we having this discussion? And i'll tell you It makes me really curious. Because we have a standard. It's the 2020 standard. And we are not fighting with that. Nobody is up here. Getting mad. Angry pissed off. Or having this. From the 2020 standards. So, Why? Are we even considering changing to the 2022 standard or the revised 22, 22, standard, or even the american birthright, which for me personally, for my personal family, Would be the right choice for me. But i know that i live in a community that is highly diverse. And it is not about what's right for me personally and just my kids and i know that So, I want to know why we can't just Change the 2020 vision. I need my glasses on and just put the concern of the inclusion of the american minority in history and civics within that 2020 version, just the little tidbits that needs to be added Why we can't just put in genocide and the holocaust. Why can't we just add them in little tidbits and financial literacy? That is not even on the table, which really concerns me. Because when i was at the school board meeting last week, I believe there was three of the school board members. That asked specifically, why the 2020 standard? Isn't on the table. And i don't think we got an answer. And that bothers me. This does not even need to be a discussion. The 2020 version is there. Let's tweak it. And then nobody is pissed really hard over here and know these really hard over there. This is a beautiful marriage. I don't want anybody to be included. I'm not gay. I'm not lesbian but best friends that are My best friend's brother used to be her sister. And i knew her when she was a girl. That we used to torture her by putting dresses on her. And now she's a boy and i don't care. His name is Nick and he's awesome. I don't care. And neither should you. And this was partners that are lesbian. I have really good friends in her gay. I best friends that are black. I don't care. Thank you. 2020, even though i hate that year, A little bit. Thank you. Thank you so much in a second. I will want to hear about it. Thanks. I'm jen, you know, so my understanding I have some community these days speak in favor of the 222 Colorado, State approved. Social studies standards for Um, i read the freedom standard, the r2 school board is weighing and i want to click the opportunity to speak in favor of the 22 Colorado, State approved, some fun standards. Specifically to raise the first graders. I noticed this specific standards as contemporary advise and behavior standards, elaborate more in the cultural companies and empathy that always in parents wish to impart our children. We live in a closer with a person ever changing world of power as parents is incumbent upon us to give our children as much information as possible. Say who grew up to be empathetic and productive members of our society? Government county is 50\"],\n  '2': [\"are a Latino or Latinas. I urge the district, they close attention to the makeup and of attendees and those providing public comment in these meetings. The voice of the majority is not being represented here, nor are our concerns for our children. We are interesting to your care. We had to find a sitter to attend this meeting others aren't so lucky. It takes a degree of privilege just to be here. Having grown up with a eurocentric public school. Curriculum myself, i can tell you that it's fairly damaging to these to experience erasure and other and social studies industry classrooms. As a third generation, Mexican american a proud Chicano. By ancestors were presented as enemies at the Alamo and did not mentioned at all. This also led to distancing and bullying for my peers. My Mexican-American parents didn't teach me that. I have no place in history. The eurocentric curriculum. Did As Dean Baldwin Road. It took many years, the vomiting of all the field i've been taught about myself and half believed before. I was able to walk on this earth as though i had a right to be here. And this is, what is that state for our children? Thank you.\\n\\n  \\nOkay, number four teams. Hi everyone. My name is Willa grassman. I live in silk. They have two boys. One that's in the district one. That's not quite there yet. He's still a little small. So What are social studies status services. The study of social relationships and the functioning of society made up of courses, primarily in history, geography, civics economics, and sociology What? I compared the first and sixth grade curriculums offered. One of the things i noticed is that the Colorado State standards are much more robust than many of these areas in the American earthquake. And it doesn't even seem to comparable. We need to give our students, all the tools to be functioning participants in the world that they live in. We need to encourage our students, to have civic engagement, and critical thinking, rather than We need to encourage our students to learn about people who are different from them, not fear better. And we have a diverse community and the public schools should be a place where all of our students will save. Welcome and included. Please keep us aligned with the Colorado State standards. Thank you. Number five, You guys can read from your phone last terrible.\\n\\n  - \\nHello, my name is jane bidokis. I'm a resident of this district. A former educator at this district. And apparent of a student in this district. Social studies is the integrated study of multiple fields social sciences. Humanities included history, culture, geography, and political science. Thomas Jefferson other founders of republic emphasized that the foot vitality of a democracy. Depends upon education and participation of its citizens. The need. For an informed citizenry. Was the very impetus for the creation of free public education. United states. If the nation is to develop a full, develop fully the readiness of a citizenry to carry forward its democratic traditions. It must support progress. Toward attainment of the vision of powerful social studies teaching, and learning, The declaration of independence ends with, we hold these truths to be self-evident. That all men are created equal. That their endowed by their creator, was certain inalienable rights that among these are life, their relieve, the pursuit of happiness All people. This is not to exclude any person regardless race. Gender ideology religion, or sexuality. This was If this was truly the vision of Thomas Jefferson, then i bet he would agree that the american birthright standards are not the standards for social studies in our public schools. Don't feel very choose vision and mission statement. Our vision is to encourage nurture and challenge every student every day. Every student every day. Our mission is to provide engaging educational experiences in a safe environment, where students and staff, which result in exemplary learning and teaching. This is included in this includes but it's not limited to the color of a person's skin, the religion that they choose to protect this practice or not practice at all. Who they call mom and dad or sister and brother girlfriend or boyfriend? Every student. Every day. If this is truly the vision of Garfield, hurry too. The choices cleared and the choice is not American birth rate standard.\\n\\n- \\nMost of what i was going to stay here. This evening has already been said quite eloquently by parents. Of i've taught in this school district and i'm afraid to go into what my students used to say. Oh mr, duran gene durant from rifle. Our mr. Grants going to give us a tank top.\\n\\n- \\nHow they describe it. But\\n\\n- \\nAgain, i'm not going to talk about what's already been presented. But what i'm curious about in school boards. Are operated under policy governments and policy. Government governments means that The school board is elected by the public. They set policy in fact, that is what The policy. But my glass of time. Policy BBA sets forth what the school boards power\\n\\n- \\nIs in. The school board has no power. Over curriculum In fact, that\\n\\n- \\nPower is bested in the superintendent. Because they are the subject matter experts in education, school board members, come for many walks alive. I've served on a school board and really all you do is approve or not approve of recommendations from the subject matter experts, which means the administration. So the i don't even know\\n\\n- \\nWhy we're\\n\\n- \\nHaving this dischargement. Because my understanding is this came from the top down. This came from the school board. From the district because the district is required again by the policy. Flip over two that Curriculum development is bested. This is policy. Hygiene is bested in the superintendent. Not the school board the superintendent. And then finally, If they adopt, American birthright standards. They're going after revise all of their policies. Because policy AEA States. The superintendent shall be responsible for developing a planned implement content, standards and meter exceed. And this starting quoted by a parent The model stay content. Standards been revised curriculum and programs of instruction to align them with the district standards from students with the educational experiences necessary to achieve standard.

So if you are interested in being part of that, so it's an application. But it's not an application that you have to pass a series of criteria, it's just so that we can get your information and reach out to you. I would say if you are considering being a part of that, one of the things that we've determined as being critically important Is that if you make that commitment that you see us out which means you come to all three of those meetings if you were to miss out on one and then you come forward and you want to be part of the proposal late in the game, really kind of changes the the kind of rules of the game.

I mean, i know you don't want to hear from me again. My name is Holly. Miller, i am a mom. Pretty active in the school but i'm not part of it. So i don't mistake me for the holly or that works with school. That's not me. Um, i think tonight is really amazing because we get to hear all of these different perspectives and our job as a community, is to really listen. Listen to everybody. But i think what we're missing right now,\\n\\n- \\nIs.\\n\\n- \\nSomebody already said, why are we having this discussion? And i'll tell you It makes me really curious. Because we have a standard. It's the 2020 standard. And we are not fighting with that. Nobody is up here. Getting mad. Angry pissed off. Or having this. From the 2020 standards. So, Why? Are we even considering changing to the 2022 standard or the revised 22, 22, standard, or even the american birthright, which for me personally, for my personal family, Would be the right choice for me. But i know that i live in a community that is highly diverse. And it is not about what's right for me personally and just my kids and i know that So, I want to know why we can't just Change the 2020 vision. I need my glasses on and just put the concern of the inclusion of the american minority in history and civics within that 2020 version, just the little tidbits that needs to be added Why we can't just put in genocide and the holocaust. Why can't we just add them in little tidbits and financial literacy? That is not even on the table, which really concerns me. Because when i was at the school board meeting last week, I believe there was three of the school board members. That asked specifically, why the 2020 standard? Isn't on the table. And i don't think we got an answer. And that bothers me. This does not even need to be a discussion. The 2020 version is there. Let's tweak it. And then nobody is pissed really hard over here and know these really hard over there. This is a beautiful marriage. I don't want anybody to be included. I'm not gay. I'm not lesbian but best friends that are My best friend's brother used to be her sister. And i knew her when she was a girl. That we used to torture her by putting dresses on her. And now she's a boy and i don't care. His name is Nick and he's awesome. I don't care. And neither should you. And this was partners that are lesbian. I have really good friends in her gay. I best friends that are black. I don't care. Thank you. 2020, even though i hate that year, A little bit. Thank you. Thank you so much in a second. I will want to hear about it. Thanks. I'm jen, you know, so my understanding I have some community these days speak in favor of the 222 Colorado, State approved. Social studies standards for Um, i read the freedom standard, the r2 school board is weighing and i want to click the opportunity to speak in favor of the 22 Colorado, State approved, some fun standards. Specifically to raise the first graders. I noticed this specific standards as contemporary advise and behavior standards, elaborate more in the cultural companies and empathy that always in parents wish to impart our children. We live in a closer with a person ever changing world of power as parents is incumbent upon us to give our children as much information as possible. Say who grew up to be empathetic and productive members of our society? Government county is 50\"],\n  '2': [\"are a Latino or Latinas. I urge the district, they close attention to the makeup and of attendees and those providing public comment in these meetings. The voice of the majority is not being represented here, nor are our concerns for our children. We are interesting to your care. We had to find a sitter to attend this meeting others aren't so lucky. It takes a degree of privilege just to be here. Having grown up with a eurocentric public school. Curriculum myself, i can tell you that it's fairly damaging to these to experience erasure and other and social studies industry classrooms. As a third generation, Mexican american a proud Chicano. By ancestors were presented as enemies at the Alamo and did not mentioned at all. This also led to distancing and bullying for my peers. My Mexican-American parents didn't teach me that. I have no place in history. The eurocentric curriculum. Did As Dean Baldwin Road. It took many years, the vomiting of all the field i've been taught about myself and half believed before. I was able to walk on this earth as though i had a right to be here. And this is, what is that state for our children? Thank you.\\n\\n  \\nOkay, number four teams. Hi everyone. My name is Willa grassman. I live in silk. They have two boys. One that's in the district one. That's not quite there yet. He's still a little small. So What are social studies status services. The study of social relationships and the functioning of society made up of courses, primarily in history, geography, civics economics, and sociology What? I compared the first and sixth grade curriculums offered. One of the things i noticed is that the Colorado State standards are much more robust than many of these areas in the American earthquake. And it doesn't even seem to comparable. We need to give our students, all the tools to be functioning participants in the world that they live in. We need to encourage our students, to have civic engagement, and critical thinking, rather than We need to encourage our students to learn about people who are different from them, not fear better. And we have a diverse community and the public schools should be a place where all of our students will save. Welcome and included. Please keep us aligned with the Colorado State standards. Thank you. Number five, You guys can read from your phone last terrible.\\n\\n  - \\nHello, my name is jane bidokis. I'm a resident of this district. A former educator at this district. And apparent of a student in this district. Social studies is the integrated study of multiple fields social sciences. Humanities included history, culture, geography, and political science. Thomas Jefferson other founders of republic emphasized that the foot vitality of a democracy. Depends upon education and participation of its citizens. The need. For an informed citizenry. Was the very impetus for the creation of free public education. United states. If the nation is to develop a full, develop fully the readiness of a citizenry to carry forward its democratic traditions. It must support progress. Toward attainment of the vision of powerful social studies teaching, and learning, The declaration of independence ends with, we hold these truths to be self-evident. That all men are created equal. That their endowed by their creator, was certain inalienable rights that among these are life, their relieve, the pursuit of happiness All people. This is not to exclude any person regardless race. Gender ideology religion, or sexuality. This was If this was truly the vision of Thomas Jefferson, then i bet he would agree that the american birthright standards are not the standards for social studies in our public schools. Don't feel very choose vision and mission statement. Our vision is to encourage nurture and challenge every student every day. Every student every day. Our mission is to provide engaging educational experiences in a safe environment, where students and staff, which result in exemplary learning and teaching. This is included in this includes but it's not limited to the color of a person's skin, the religion that they choose to protect this practice or not practice at all. Who they call mom and dad or sister and brother girlfriend or boyfriend? Every student. Every day. If this is truly the vision of Garfield, hurry too. The choices cleared and the choice is not American birth rate standard.\\n\\n- \\nMost of what i was going to stay here. This evening has already been said quite eloquently by parents. Of i've taught in this school district and i'm afraid to go into what my students used to say. Oh mr, duran gene durant from rifle. Our mr. Grants going to give us a tank top.\\n\\n- \\nHow they describe it. But\\n\\n- \\nAgain, i'm not going to talk about what's already been presented. But what i'm curious about in school boards. Are operated under policy governments and policy. Government governments means that The school board is elected by the public. They set policy in fact, that is what The policy. But my glass of time. Policy BBA sets forth what the school boards power\\n\\n- \\nIs in. The school board has no power. Over curriculum In fact, that\\n\\n- \\nPower is bested in the superintendent. Because they are the subject matter experts in education, school board members, come for many walks alive. I've served on a school board and really all you do is approve or not approve of recommendations from the subject matter experts, which means the administration. So the i don't even know\\n\\n- \\nWhy we're\\n\\n- \\nHaving this dischargement. Because my understanding is this came from the top down. This came from the school board. From the district because the district is required again by the policy. Flip over two that Curriculum development is bested. This is policy. Hygiene is bested in the superintendent. Not the school board the superintendent. And then finally, If they adopt, American birthright standards. They're going after revise all of their policies. Because policy AEA States. The superintendent shall be responsible for developing a planned implement content, standards and meter exceed. And this starting quoted by a parent The model stay content. Standards been revised curriculum and programs of instruction to align them with the district standards from students with the educational experiences necessary to achieve standard. The plan shall also address the professional development, and we've heard about that. Teachers, and administrators to enable successful implementation of standards-based education. Not a minority view, the standards of the state of colorado.

                            " -   \nAnd i have some of my teammates with me this evening. So, assistant superintendent, they appears and i have our elementary curriculum director somehow richardson and then i have our communications director Teresa hamilton. We have our finance team. We have our director maintenance in the back. Some board members are in the room. Um our director of curriculum, secondary unfortunately is sick and so that's why. Jacob pinko is not here tonight. Um, so i want to pass on his. My thoughts are with all of us tonight from him in particular. Um, so that being said, i'm going to say thank you. For being here and thank you for taking the time tonight to come and listen to each other. Really our job is to hear from the constituents and the community, our parents our staff. I'm where we're at on this issue because it has not been a clear pathway for Garfield R2 to get here. And so when it's not clear, then we need your help. And it's in our policy that says We need your help. And so that is why we've made it to this point. This is our second community meeting. Um, and so appreciate your time. Some of the background information that i want to give to all of you. Before we get started this evening, is that there's been many questions about the social studies standards in general. And it started back in 2020, actually. And so, it still is a journey that we're on. And i want to give you a little background about content standards from colorado academic standards in general. There are 13 content areas across the board of which are reviewed at the state level, what used to be up until 2020 every six years. So that was english language, arts science, social studies. Performing arts, etc. We're all part of the content standards that we're reviewing. In 2020, they changed the law at the state and they began to chunk them by thirds. And they decided that every two years they would review a third of the content standards for the state of colorado. Social studies, and the arts were the first two content areas that were in the queue to be reviewed. First, And that is why we are teaching right now currently the 2020 standards and the reason it's only 2022 and we're looking at this again is because we're on a new review cycle for the state of Colorado. The second thing that you need to know is that in 2021 of november, The public was invited to weigh in on social studies with a series of state level surveys and community meetings across the state for people to weigh in on how they felt about our social studies. Curriculum in general, In june of 2022. Task forces presented their proposals to the state of colorado. And then there was the vote of the current 2022, standards which i believe are what has presented some controversy in particular to our communities and those were actually adopted in 2022. And that is what i believe is, one of the reasons why we're going to receiving. The expectation is that we will fully implement the standards in the year 2425. So this year, we are in a process with our communities, and our school board to adopt the standards, which will go forward and execute for the school year. Starting in august of 2024. What i will tell you is that there was a question that came in the community meeting last time and might actually be here as well. With some of you is that people wanted to know. Well if we have a whole year, why we talking about it in september? And the bottom line is this If you are in education and you are a staff member in particular to a teacher or an administrator or an academic coach that has to execute the state standards. You need time to be able to prep and to plan. Deeply for the children of which you're going to serve. So, what we want to do is take what our proposal will be. We want to bring this to the school board. In october. And we want to be able to move forward in the spring start. Well winter. I guess anywhere is no spring but in january from january to may is where our district would have an opportunity to meet with staff meet with administration and plan. Appropriately for the 24 25 school. So that was a question that came out last time is, why are we not waiting then? Until the spring of 24 or the spring of 23, it's too late. This bottom line too late if we wait until next. And the other thing that's come up, as of recent times is our teachers need a professional development plan, professional development plan, that is worthy. And they need, we need as district office and leadership. We need to be able to provide that for them and have a plan. Because in particular social studies, they no longer are necessarily prepped in the same way in 2020 degrees that they were in 2019. And they deserve a professional development plan that prepares them to the best of their abilities to be able to give to your children, what they deserve. And so that's where our timeline is. And, So, i got Um, before i get started smoking, ask is there anybody in the room that needs translation? We do have translator here available and headsets. So please see Teresa. If you'd like to have a lovely lady. And then also John Oldham is standing out numbers. If you prepare to speak this evening we integrown go over the guidelines around that, but he can bring you a number. If you just raise your hand right now, you don't have one already. And then i'm just going to elaborate a little bit more on the timeline. You'll find a copy of the timeline over on the table over here. So one with the blue on it, In 2020, as Heather said the state that revised, the standard concept worth it, we were going to bring 2022 in. 2022, is in a new set of standards forward. Um, in november of 2021, this is important part. The colorado department of education, passed some new laws and this is what really generated the changes in the standard. The new laws were around American minorities, around genocide, and holocaust, and around financial literacy. And all of those pieces are required by law, to be added to the standards. Whatever it is. We choose to do adopt and so that's what the state did. They took those laws? Put them in to the root of 2022, standards that they eventually adopted. Um, in May of 2022, the stakes set for some working groups to provide the proposed language in the standard. They'd heard from community members, for around the state on that, there may be some controversy around that and they wanted to see what that feedback would be from around the state. They provides the standards. At that point and took out some of the controversial language. When they went to vote in november of 22, the state school board, almost standards, they voted on the original standards that had the controversial language in it. So that is what it is adopted by the standard. Colorado is the 2022. Standards that revise standards that we put forward for you are what they had proposed before. The problem. November 22. Looked after gathering statewide improvement in spring of 23, the administrative team. Collaborated with the school board and a board workshop on potential pathways for moving forward to address the adoptions of social studies standards. And then an august of 2023 at the last board meeting the board approved and action plan and incorporated community, staff student feedback, and established a review committee that will look at all of that feedback that will gathering from you tonight or not, and the other nights as well as on the survey. That the committee will put together a proposal to be delivered to the board horrible in at the end of October. And tonight, we have till 7 o'clock for this community forum by the time i test stop speaking, we'll have about 45 minutes. Our goal is to honor that time frame. You may or may not know. We have a new strategic plan part of that strategic plan called community cornerstones. In that can be section of the strategic plan, there's one, Um, called civilian. Specifically relating to everybody deserves respect in. That is the grounds that we'd like to stand on tonight. These meetings are a platform for our community voices regarding social studies to be heard. We will answer questions about the process, but we will not answer questions about the standards themselves. Everyone is entitled to their opinion and we respect that we aren't here to debate. We're not asking you to agree with what you hear or to agree with each other, but we are asking you to respect each other. As district leaders will remain objective through this process because we don't want to sway anybody in one direction or another. Um, since this is not a form for debate and we want to honor community voices as quickly as we can in a timely manner, we ask you to hold all of us. Our job is to collect information that will help us understand our community. Seventies We're taking notes. We were hoping to be able to view them. The library came up here to help us and it didn't pan out. How the community comments will be made public. Um, these community comments is just one piece of our puzzle to consider in crafting a formal word, proposal moving forward. Y'all have numbers and we'll call your numbers in that order for you to speak. If you didn't get a number hopefully at the end, if you would like to say something, there's enough time for you to do that. No matter what the survey that is available online is an avenue for your voice to be heard. We also have QR codes here tonight that you can scan in order to get the survey. Is there. Anybody else who needs a number at this point? Okay, thank you. Um, each speaker will have three minutes to speak. I will try hard not to interrupt you, but you'll see me step forward when you're three minutes is up. And then, as soon as i get a chance, i will say thank you and your time will be done. Um, That is it as far as our process here tonight. So Let's hear some of what you have to say to help guide us in this big decision. Speak the number one, And by the way, would you please say your name and where which community you're representing tonight? Thank you.\n\n  - \nRight?\n\n  - \nSo my name is david. I'm representing this community. I'm sales just go ahead and kick this puppy off here,\n\n  \nCome on, a lot of time, i got lesson plan. All\n\n  - \nRight, so hi, my name is david. I'm an 11 year teacher in all subjects, including history of history for seven years on the two-time more veteran patriot had a father of the challenge district adopting, these standards is a terrible idea for a variety of reasons, and personal opinion, has nothing to do with standards. It has to do the adapt. Proponents have not been clear the messaging and i would like to amend it for you personally. Most importantly we already have state standards, you might think they're controversial, and that's right. But they are the legally required and mandated standards that we assess in the classroom. And if i'm not sticking there are financial penalties for not adopting them at a state level at the school level. There are likely in penalties for ignoringum and adding increases damage from our schools because our teachers have already hard enough to retain and get quality in. So we start dressing things like funding, it's seriously wrong. Okay, we are legally required to meet or exceed, whatever. The state standards are as previously articulate. Which means even if we adopt the abs standards, we still have to meet and or exceed the state standards, which to me there's zero need for that. It's putting a hat on a hat. You already have what we need to teach that, teach to the assessments that we are given. So doing things that are above and beyond that seems purpose to me. Now, this would be a great opportunity for parents to adopt these ADA stairs. They are true to their hearts and teach them in their homes. So that we are not conflicting, the information. This will gets to teach what a statemented and parents get to do what is right for parents to do, which is to critique and to temper, the education that is provided from public, and i think that's cool. So adopting me standards assumes that teachers are always going to be doing one ignoring the teacher, the legally mandated standards from State two teaching twice, the standards with conflicting information, oftentimes or three teaching standards that do not need educational criteria and are likely affect college entrance, even program credit and stunt general historical understanding. Second, it comes from a, clearly political and religious perspective. I've read while political understanding is crucial friendship future leaders. It should be presented in a neutral manner that includes many perspectives and encourages students to be critically and draw their own conclusions. The state standard already addresses politics and government functions in detail. Trust me of topic. This should be a clear separation between church and state as outlined in the first amendment of the United States Constitution. Now the current state standards already include religious perspectives from all five, major world religions, trust me up, top them presented in a manner that does not promote nor endorses specific path to spirituality or religion. These are done in a neutral fact-based way and parents are encouraged to again, temper, the spiritual education of their children,\n\n  - \nWith their\n\n  - \nOwn experiences perspective, they have the right to pull their kids out of those classes. And i have that happen to me before. I do not fault the parents. They do not fault the kids. It is simply something that needs to be done in education, is to provide a variety of experience and perspective. Third, it's already been rejected by CD. It's been unially firstly panned by civics of organizations such as the now set of national council for the social studies which is 102 year old organization that focuses primarily on social studies all around the United States and last history's messy, it is filled with gray areas, mistakes, atrocities successes confuse\n\n  - \nThem\n\n  - \nChanging beliefs\n\n  - \nAnd fun part, and changing beliefs to only present the positive or the details that make ourselves look good is not history and i'm proud of my country. And i was willing to put my life on the line for my country. Let us teach you.\n\n  \nI did my best and i'm recording it so we'll get it. It just\n\n  - \nWe are\n\n  \nNumbers here.\n\n  - \nSo one is back the one, obviously. Well, i'm speaking if they were the Colorado State approved. 2022, standards. I participated in the community input in 2021 great process, lengthy, thorough appropriate and i trust the state's process, the RAP boards proposal. Circumvents the established system and serves a personal interest of select view, american birthright, glorifies the eurocentric christian fundamentalis. Narrative of historical events and social dynamics. That is not the narrative. That is representative of the population of this country. This state is School district. It minimizes perspective of many. To maintain the comfort comfort of a narrow demographic. I want my kids to learn perspectives and that would be an understanding complex issues. Um, i looked it up. I was reading it. The word Chicano does not appear once in American Birthright standard. My children are in Chicago. There are my kids are the nephews of beloved, aunts and uncles who are part of the LGBTQ community. Not something that the american reference standard cost to address still hall uprising. For example,\n\n  \nNot mentioned once.\n\n  - \nThey're growing up in a proud union in the household, both their parents are active members in their unions. And i know where it does. Marry the birthright mention in the united farm workers. America birthright uses the term civil rights fewer times than it uses the word god.\n\n  \nIt's not.\n\n  - \nPropaganda. Just one high school district.\n\n  \nThank you.\n\n  - \nSleeping\n\n  - \nEveryone. My name is stephen arousa. I have two children individual field and rifle I like to think district staff and library for having us here today, That's Colorado public schools. Re2 is required to lead or exceed colorado, academic standards. Since the Colorado Department of Education is already determined that the american birthright standards are not acceptable. This district needs to provide an assessment of potential legal and or financial ramifications for refusing to about the revise 2022. Colorado academic standards. Public funds have already been spent to pursue this curriculum after it has been rejected. So we need to know what our financial liability is. If we pursue this path. Teachers are overworked and underpaid, as it is, the Colorado Department of Education, website states, that all Colorado districts are required to without local standards that meet or exceed colorado academic standings. Again, the CDE has rejected the american vertebrate standards, so they clearly don't meet or exceed, the Colorado, academic standards, which are also the basis of the annual data assessment. This means in an addition to over 100 social studies standards, we passed teachers to teach. They will also be expected to simply pile on the additional eurocentric christian nationalist indoctrination. If RA2 is forced to violate the requirement to meet or exceed colorado, academic standards, they will also be setting our children up for failure in annual state assessments Our school board and district need to be focused on employee retention, not explicitly trying to overburden and compromise our teachers. Greater than 50% of the students enrolled at RE2 are a Latino or Latinas. I urge the district, they close attention to the makeup and of attendees and those providing public comment in these meetings. The voice of the majority is not being represented here, nor are our concerns for our children. We are interesting to your care. We had to find a sitter to attend this meeting others aren't so lucky. It takes a degree of privilege just to be here. Having grown up with a eurocentric public school. Curriculum myself, i can tell you that it's fairly damaging to these to experience erasure and other and social studies industry classrooms. As a third generation, Mexican american a proud Chicano. By ancestors were presented as enemies at the Alamo and did not mentioned at all. This also led to distancing and bullying for my peers. My Mexican-American parents didn't teach me that. I have no place in history. The eurocentric curriculum. Did As Dean Baldwin Road. It took many years, the vomiting of all the field i've been taught about myself and half believed before. I was able to walk on this earth as though i had a right to be here. And this is, what is that state for our children? Thank you.\n\n  \nOkay, number four teams. Hi everyone. My name is Willa grassman. I live in silk. They have two boys. One that's in the district one. That's not quite there yet. He's still a little small. So What are social studies status services. The study of social relationships and the functioning of society made up of courses, primarily in history, geography, civics economics, and sociology What? I compared the first and sixth grade curriculums offered. One of the things i noticed is that the Colorado State standards are much more robust than many of these areas in the American earthquake. And it doesn't even seem to comparable. We need to give our students, all the tools to be functioning participants in the world that they live in. We need to encourage our students, to have civic engagement, and critical thinking, rather than We need to encourage our students to learn about people who are different from them, not fear better. And we have a diverse community and the public schools should be a place where all of our students will save. Welcome and included. Please keep us aligned with the Colorado State standards. Thank you. Number five, You guys can read from your phone last terrible.\n\n  - \nHello, my name is jane bidokis. I'm a resident of this district. A former educator at this district. And apparent of a student in this district. Social studies is the integrated study of multiple fields social sciences. Humanities included history, culture, geography, and political science.

Gender ideology religion, or sexuality. This was If this was truly the vision of Thomas Jefferson, then i bet he would agree that the american birthright standards are not the standards for social studies in our public schools.

                            "Based on the provided transcript, the meeting appears to be a community forum focused on the adoption of new social studies standards for the Garfield R2 school district. The meeting involves various stakeholders, including district administrators, teachers, and community members. The main points of discussion include:\n\n1. **Background Information**: The assistant superintendent provides an overview of the changes in Colorado's academic standards, particularly in social studies. The state has shifted from a six-year review cycle to a two-year cycle, and new standards were adopted in 2022. The district is expected to fully implement these standards by the 2024-2025 school year.\n\n2. **Community Input**: The meeting aims to gather feedback from the community on the adoption of these new standards. This is the second community meeting on the topic.\n\n3. **Concerns About New Standards**: Various speakers express their views on the proposed standards. Some argue that the new standards are politically and religiously biased, while others worry about the financial and legal ramifications of not adopting state-mandated standards.\n\n4. **Teacher Perspective**: One speaker, David, who is a teacher, argues that adopting new standards would be redundant and could lead to financial penalties. He suggests that the current state standards are sufficient and legally mandated.\n\n5. **Diversity and Inclusion**: Several speakers emphasize the need for a curriculum that is inclusive and representative of the diverse community. They argue that the proposed \"American Birthright\" standards are Eurocentric and do not adequately represent minorities.\n\n6. **Timeline and Process**: The district plans to bring a proposal to the school board in October, with planning and implementation to occur from January to May for the 2024-2025 school year.\n\n7. **Respect and Objectivity**: The administrators stress the importance of respectful dialogue and state that they will remain objective during the process.\n\nOverall, the meeting serves as a platform for community members to express their opinions on the new social studies standards. There is a range of views, but common themes include concerns about inclusivity, the need for community input, and questions about the necessity and implications of adopting new standards."

                            " -   \nAnd i have some of my teammates with me this evening. So, assistant superintendent, they appears and i have our elementary curriculum director somehow richardson and then i have our communications director Teresa hamilton. We have our finance team. We have our director maintenance in the back. Some board members are in the room. Um our director of curriculum, secondary unfortunately is sick and so that's why. Jacob pinko is not here tonight. Um, so i want to pass on his. My thoughts are with all of us tonight from him in particular. Um, so that being said, i'm going to say thank you. For being here and thank you for taking the time tonight to come and listen to each other. Really our job is to hear from the constituents and the community, our parents our staff. I'm where we're at on this issue because it has not been a clear pathway for Garfield R2 to get here. And so when it's not clear, then we need your help. And it's in our policy that says We need your help. And so that is why we've made it to this point. This is our second community meeting. Um, and so appreciate your time. Some of the background information that i want to give to all of you. Before we get started this evening, is that there's been many questions about the social studies standards in general. And it started back in 2020, actually. And so, it still is a journey that we're on. And i want to give you a little background about content standards from colorado academic standards in general. There are 13 content areas across the board of which are reviewed at the state level, what used to be up until 2020 every six years. So that was english language, arts science, social studies. Performing arts, etc. We're all part of the content standards that we're reviewing. In 2020, they changed the law at the state and they began to chunk them by thirds. And they decided that every two years they would review a third of the content standards for the state of colorado. Social studies, and the arts were the first two content areas that were in the queue to be reviewed. First, And that is why we are teaching right now currently the 2020 standards and the reason it's only 2022 and we're looking at this again is because we're on a new review cycle for the state of Colorado. The second thing that you need to know is that in 2021 of november, The public was invited to weigh in on social studies with a series of state level surveys and community meetings across the state for people to weigh in on how they felt about our social studies. Curriculum in general, In june of 2022. Task forces presented their proposals to the state of colorado. And then there was the vote of the current 2022, standards which i believe are what has presented some controversy in particular to our communities and those were actually adopted in 2022. And that is what i believe is, one of the reasons why we're going to receiving. The expectation is that we will fully implement the standards in the year 2425. So this year, we are in a process with our communities, and our school board to adopt the standards, which will go forward and execute for the school year. Starting in august of 2024. What i will tell you is that there was a question that came in the community meeting last time and might actually be here as well. With some of you is that people wanted to know. Well if we have a whole year, why we talking about it in september? And the bottom line is this If you are in education and you are a staff member in particular to a teacher or an administrator or an academic coach that has to execute the state standards. You need time to be able to prep and to plan. Deeply for the children of which you're going to serve. So, what we want to do is take what our proposal will be. We want to bring this to the school board. In october. And we want to be able to move forward in the spring start. Well winter. I guess anywhere is no spring but in january from january to may is where our district would have an opportunity to meet with staff meet with administration and plan. Appropriately for the 24 25 school. So that was a question that came out last time is, why are we not waiting then? Until the spring of 24 or the spring of 23, it's too late. This bottom line too late if we wait until next. And the other thing that's come up, as of recent times is our teachers need a professional development plan, professional development plan, that is worthy. And they need, we need as district office and leadership. We need to be able to provide that for them and have a plan. Because in particular social studies, they no longer are necessarily prepped in the same way in 2020 degrees that they were in 2019. And they deserve a professional development plan that prepares them to the best of their abilities to be able to give to your children, what they deserve. And so that's where our timeline is. And, So, i got Um, before i get started smoking, ask is there anybody in the room that needs translation? We do have translator here available and headsets. So please see Teresa. If you'd like to have a lovely lady. And then also John Oldham is standing out numbers. If you prepare to speak this evening we integrown go over the guidelines around that, but he can bring you a number. If you just raise your hand right now, you don't have one already. And then i'm just going to elaborate a little bit more on the timeline. You'll find a copy of the timeline over on the table over here. So one with the blue on it, In 2020, as Heather said the state that revised, the standard concept worth it, we were going to bring 2022 in. 2022, is in a new set of standards forward. Um, in november of 2021, this is important part. The colorado department of education, passed some new laws and this is what really generated the changes in the standard. The new laws were around American minorities, around genocide, and holocaust, and around financial literacy. And all of those pieces are required by law, to be added to the standards. Whatever it is. We choose to do adopt and so that's what the state did. They took those laws? Put them in to the root of 2022, standards that they eventually adopted. Um, in May of 2022, the stakes set for some working groups to provide the proposed language in the standard. They'd heard from community members, for around the state on that, there may be some controversy around that and they wanted to see what that feedback would be from around the state. They provides the standards. At that point and took out some of the controversial language. When they went to vote in november of 22, the state school board, almost standards, they voted on the original standards that had the controversial language in it. So that is what it is adopted by the standard. Colorado is the 2022. Standards that revise standards that we put forward for you are what they had proposed before. The problem. November 22. Looked after gathering statewide improvement in spring of 23, the administrative team. Collaborated with the school board and a board workshop on potential pathways for moving forward to address the adoptions of social studies standards. And then an august of 2023 at the last board meeting the board approved and action plan and incorporated community, staff student feedback, and established a review committee that will look at all of that feedback that will gathering from you tonight or not, and the other nights as well as on the survey. That the committee will put together a proposal to be delivered to the board horrible in at the end of October. And tonight, we have till 7 o'clock for this community forum by the time i test stop speaking, we'll have about 45 minutes. Our goal is to honor that time frame. You may or may not know. We have a new strategic plan part of that strategic plan called community cornerstones. In that can be section of the strategic plan, there's one, Um, called civilian. Specifically relating to everybody deserves respect in. That is the grounds that we'd like to stand on tonight. These meetings are a platform for our community voices regarding social studies to be heard. We will answer questions about the process, but we will not answer questions about the standards themselves. Everyone is entitled to their opinion and we respect that we aren't here to debate. We're not asking you to agree with what you hear or to agree with each other, but we are asking you to respect each other. As district leaders will remain objective through this process because we don't want to sway anybody in one direction or another. Um, since this is not a form for debate and we want to honor community voices as quickly as we can in a timely manner, we ask you to hold all of us. Our job is to collect information that will help us understand our community. Seventies We're taking notes. We were hoping to be able to view them. The library came up here to help us and it didn't pan out. How the community comments will be made public. Um, these community comments is just one piece of our puzzle to consider in crafting a formal word, proposal moving forward. Y'all have numbers and we'll call your numbers in that order for you to speak. If you didn't get a number hopefully at the end, if you would like to say something, there's enough time for you to do that. No matter what the survey that is available online is an avenue for your voice to be heard. We also have QR codes here tonight that you can scan in order to get the survey. Is there. Anybody else who needs a number at this point? Okay, thank you. Um, each speaker will have three minutes to speak. I will try hard not to interrupt you, but you'll see me step forward when you're three minutes is up. And then, as soon as i get a chance, i will say thank you and your time will be done. Um, That is it as far as our process here tonight. So Let's hear some of what you have to say to help guide us in this big decision. Speak the number one, And by the way, would you please say your name and where which community you're representing tonight? Thank you.\n\n  - \nRight?\n\n  - \nSo my name is david. I'm representing this community. I'm sales just go ahead and kick this puppy off here,\n\n  \nCome on, a lot of time, i got lesson plan. All\n\n  - \nRight, so hi, my name is david. I'm an 11 year teacher in all subjects, including history of history for seven years on the two-time more veteran patriot had a father of the challenge district adopting, these standards is a terrible idea for a variety of reasons, and personal opinion, has nothing to do with standards. It has to do the adapt. Proponents have not been clear the messaging and i would like to amend it for you personally. Most importantly we already have state standards, you might think they're controversial, and that's right. But they are the legally required and mandated standards that we assess in the classroom. And if i'm not sticking there are financial penalties for not adopting them at a state level at the school level. There are likely in penalties for ignoringum and adding increases damage from our schools because our teachers have already hard enough to retain and get quality in. So we start dressing things like funding, it's seriously wrong. Okay, we are legally required to meet or exceed, whatever. The state standards are as previously articulate. Which means even if we adopt the abs standards, we still have to meet and or exceed the state standards, which to me there's zero need for that. It's putting a hat on a hat. You already have what we need to teach that, teach to the assessments that we are given. So doing things that are above and beyond that seems purpose to me. Now, this would be a great opportunity for parents to adopt these ADA stairs. They are true to their hearts and teach them in their homes. So that we are not conflicting, the information. This will gets to teach what a statemented and parents get to do what is right for parents to do, which is to critique and to temper, the education that is provided from public, and i think that's cool. So adopting me standards assumes that teachers are always going to be doing one ignoring the teacher, the legally mandated standards from State two teaching twice, the standards with conflicting information, oftentimes or three teaching standards that do not need educational criteria and are likely affect college entrance, even program credit and stunt general historical understanding. Second, it comes from a, clearly political and religious perspective. I've read while political understanding is crucial friendship future leaders. It should be presented in a neutral manner that includes many perspectives and encourages students to be critically and draw their own conclusions. The state standard already addresses politics and government functions in detail. Trust me of topic. This should be a clear separation between church and state as outlined in the first amendment of the United States Constitution. Now the current state standards already include religious perspectives from all five, major world religions, trust me up, top them presented in a manner that does not promote nor endorses specific path to spirituality or religion. These are done in a neutral fact-based way and parents are encouraged to again, temper, the spiritual education of their children,\n\n  - \nWith their\n\n  - \nOwn experiences perspective, they have the right to pull their kids out of those classes. And i have that happen to me before. I do not fault the parents. They do not fault the kids. It is simply something that needs to be done in education, is to provide a variety of experience and perspective. Third, it's already been rejected by CD. It's been unially firstly panned by civics of organizations such as the now set of national council for the social studies which is 102 year old organization that focuses primarily on social studies all around the United States and last history's messy, it is filled with gray areas, mistakes, atrocities successes confuse\n\n  - \nThem\n\n  - \nChanging beliefs\n\n  - \nAnd fun part, and changing beliefs to only present the positive or the details that make ourselves look good is not history and i'm proud of my country. And i was willing to put my life on the line for my country. Let us teach you.\n\n  \nI did my best and i'm recording it so we'll get it. It just\n\n  - \nWe are\n\n  \nNumbers here.\n\n  - \nSo one is back the one, obviously. Well, i'm speaking if they were the Colorado State approved. 2022, standards. I participated in the community input in 2021 great process, lengthy, thorough appropriate and i trust the state's process, the RAP boards proposal. Circumvents the established system and serves a personal interest of select view, american birthright, glorifies the eurocentric christian fundamentalis. Narrative of historical events and social dynamics. That is not the narrative. That is representative of the population of this country. This state is School district. It minimizes perspective of many. To maintain the comfort comfort of a narrow demographic. I want my kids to learn perspectives and that would be an understanding complex issues. Um, i looked it up. I was reading it. The word Chicano does not appear once in American Birthright standard. My children are in Chicago. There are my kids are the nephews of beloved, aunts and uncles who are part of the LGBTQ community. Not something that the american reference standard cost to address still hall uprising. For example,\n\n  \nNot mentioned once.\n\n  - \nThey're growing up in a proud union in the household, both their parents are active members in their unions. And i know where it does. Marry the birthright mention in the united farm workers. America birthright uses the term civil rights fewer times than it uses the word god.\n\n  \nIt's not.\n\n  - \nPropaganda. Just one high school district.\n\n  \nThank you.\n\n  - \nSleeping\n\n  - \nEveryone. My name is stephen arousa. I have two children individual field and rifle I like to think district staff and library for having us here today, That's Colorado public schools. Re2 is required to lead or exceed colorado, academic standards. Since the Colorado Department of Education is already determined that the american birthright standards are not acceptable. This district needs to provide an assessment of potential legal and or financial ramifications for refusing to about the revise 2022. Colorado academic standards. Public funds have already been spent to pursue this curriculum after it has been rejected. So we need to know what our financial liability is. If we pursue this path. Teachers are overworked and underpaid, as it is, the Colorado Department of Education, website states, that all Colorado districts are required to without local standards that meet or exceed colorado academic standings. Again, the CDE has rejected the american vertebrate standards, so they clearly don't meet or exceed, the Colorado, academic standards, which are also the basis of the annual data assessment. This means in an addition to over 100 social studies standards, we passed teachers to teach. They will also be expected to simply pile on the additional eurocentric christian nationalist indoctrination. If RA2 is forced to violate the requirement to meet or exceed colorado, academic standards, they will also be setting our children up for failure in annual state assessments Our school board and district need to be focused on employee retention, not explicitly trying to overburden and compromise our teachers. Greater than 50% of the students enrolled at RE2 are a Latino or Latinas. I urge the district, they close attention to the makeup and of attendees and those providing public comment in these meetings. The voice of the majority is not being represented here, nor are our concerns for our children. We are interesting to your care. We had to find a sitter to attend this meeting others aren't so lucky. It takes a degree of privilege just to be here. Having grown up with a eurocentric public school. Curriculum myself, i can tell you that it's fairly damaging to these to experience erasure and other and social studies industry classrooms. As a third generation, Mexican american a proud Chicano. By ancestors were presented as enemies at the Alamo and did not mentioned at all. This also led to distancing and bullying for my peers. My Mexican-American parents didn't teach me that. I have no place in history. The eurocentric curriculum. Did As Dean Baldwin Road. It took many years, the vomiting of all the field i've been taught about myself and half believed before. I was able to walk on this earth as though i had a right to be here. And this is, what is that state for our children? Thank you.\n\n  \nOkay, number four teams. Hi everyone. My name is Willa grassman. I live in silk. They have two boys. One that's in the district one. That's not quite there yet. He's still a little small. So What are social studies status services. The study of social relationships and the functioning of society made up of courses, primarily in history, geography, civics economics, and sociology What? I compared the first and sixth grade curriculums offered. One of the things i noticed is that the Colorado State standards are much more robust than many of these areas in the American earthquake. And it doesn't even seem to comparable. We need to give our students, all the tools to be functioning participants in the world that they live in. We need to encourage our students, to have civic engagement, and critical thinking, rather than We need to encourage our students to learn about people who are different from them, not fear better. And we have a diverse community and the public schools should be a place where all of our students will save. Welcome and included. Please keep us aligned with the Colorado State standards. Thank you. Number five, You guys can read from your phone last terrible.\n\n  - \nHello, my name is jane bidokis. I'm a resident of this district. A former educator at this district.

                            "Absolutely, finding the right balance in an RPG can be tricky. Based on what you've mentioned, you might enjoy games that offer depth without overwhelming complexity. Here are a few suggestions:\n\n1. \"Undertale\" - A unique RPG that allows you to choose between combat and non-combat resolutions. It has a compelling narrative without being overwhelming.\n  \n2. \"Firewatch\" - Though not a traditional RPG, it has strong narrative elements and decision-making that affect the story. The game is relatively short and not overly complex.\n\n3. \"The Outer Worlds\" - Developed by Obsidian, this game offers a deep narrative and role-playing elements without the overwhelming open world of something like Skyrim.\n\nLet me know if any of these catch your eye or if you're looking for something different!"

It offers intricate decision-making but without the typical D&D mechanics.\n  \n2. \"Hades\" - A rogue-like dungeon crawler with RPG elements. It's not decision-heavy, but the gameplay and narrative are tightly woven, and it's not overwhelming.\n\n3. \"Oxenfree\" - Although not isometric or strictly an RPG, it has real-time dialogue choices that affect the story. It's relatively simple but offers depth in its narrative and decision-making.\n\nGiven your criteria, \"Disco Elysium\" might be particularly interesting for you. It has a very different approach to role-playing, focusing on internal dialogues and skill checks that differ from traditional D&D mechanics. Would you like to explore more options like these?"

Click on the Apple logo in the top-left corner of your screen to open the Apple menu.\n\n2. Select \"System Preferences\" from the dropdown menu.\n\n3. In the System Preferences window, click on the \"Sound\" icon.\n\n4. In the Sound preferences, go to the \"Input\" tab. This is where you can select your microphone input.\n\n5. Choose the microphone you want to use from the list of available input devices. You should see a list of microphones connected to your iMac. Select the one you want to use for input.\n\n6. Now, go to the \"Output\" tab. This is where you can select the audio output device (speakers).\n\n7. From the list of available output devices, choose the speakers you want to use for audio output. These are typically labeled as \"Internal Speakers\" or the name of any external speakers you have connected to your iMac.\n\n8. Once you've selected both the microphone and the speakers, close the Sound preferences window.\n\nYour microphone should now be set to input audio, and the output will play through the selected speakers. Make sure the volume is turned up on your speakers, and you should be able to hear your microphone input through them."

Here are a few of the easiest and most effective methods\",\"og:site_name\":\"PCMAG\",\"og:title\":\"How to Download YouTube Videos\",\"og:type\":\"article\",\"og:url\":\"https://www.pcmag.com/how-to/how-to-download-youtube-videos\"},\"title\":\"\",\"content\":\"There are billions of hours of video on YouTube, literally. And that's hardly the most astounding statistic about the site, which has been the go-to destination for uploading and watching videos online since 2005. That said, sometimes you really want or need to have one of those videos on your own computer or phone. But when the topic of downloading YouTube videos comes up, there's a side subject that must be broached: Is it legal?On the copyright front, as long as you're downloading a video\u00a0for your own personal offline use, you're probably okay. It's more black and white when you consider\u00a0Google's terms of service for YouTube, which read: \\\"You are not allowed to...access, reproduce, download, distribute, transmit, broadcast, display, sell, license, alter, modify or otherwise use any part of the Service or any Content except: (a) as expressly authorized by the Service; or (b) with prior written permission from YouTube and, if applicable, the respective rights holders.\\\"\\n How to Download YouTube Videos\\nWatching YouTube videos offline through unofficial channels takes money from Google and video creators. There's a reason YouTube runs ads: People make a living this way.Obviously, stealing videos from YouTube is a big no-no. If you want to\u00a0share\u00a0a video, YouTube and most other video sites make it easy, from embedding to emailing to sharing via social networks. You simply do not need to download a video most of the time.But you have your reasons. If you\u00a0must\u00a0download a YouTube video\u2014absolutely need to, just for yourself, and not for dissemination, and not to be a jerk\u2014here's how.Note: This story is updated frequently, as the tools involved change regularly. Some of those changes are not always pleasant, such as software so full of \\\"extras,\\\" it gets flagged as malware by\u00a0antivirus tools. The same goes for the helper websites\u2014a change in a site's ad network can also create issues with\u00a0malware.To prevent this from becoming a laundry list of programs and sites that can download YouTube videos, we came up with a few rules for inclusion. Services must:Work with the top three video sites:\u00a0YouTube, Facebook, and Vimeo.Download entire playlists\u00a0or channels in a batch (on YouTube), at least with a paid version.Output to MP3\u00a0for audio (or offer companion software that does so).Have an interface that\u00a0doesn't suck.Not collect your personal data\u00a0beyond your email address.Not contain malware. If there's even a whiff of it, even a\u00a0PUP, it's out.The programs, services, and sites in this story are all free of spam and virus problems as of this writing, but\u00a0caveat emptor\u2014let the buyer beware. (Especially if you're not really\u00a0buying.)YouTube Premium DownloadsNow available for subscribers of YouTube Premium\u2014the paid version of YouTube that allows you to watch without ads\u2014are video downloads\u2014kind of. There's one limitation with quality: All the video you download is limited to 1080p quality max or lower. No 4K. \\n(Credit: PCMag/YouTube)\\nThe biggest issue is, this feature doesn't really download a video to save on your computer forever. It is more akin to the download feature found on mobile apps for Netflix and Hulu, which makes a streaming video available to watch later using your local storage using the app's interface only. This is not a method that allows you to, say, watch a video using different software such as the VLC Media Player or Plex.You access the download by going to the YouTube hamburger menu and selecting Downloads to view the list of what you've grabbed. The page says \\\"Downloads remain available as long as your device has an active internet connection at least once every 30 days.\\\" This probably isn't exactly what you are looking for in a download; read on for tools that are a better fit.\\n$11.99 Per Month at YouTube\\nSee It\\n \\nDesktop SoftwareThird-party software is what will give you the best control over downloading online videos. Typically, you paste the URL for the YouTube video you want into the program, and it downloads the highest-quality version it can find. For videos in 1080p high definition (HD) format, that's usually an MP4 file. For anything higher in quality\u20144K or 8K\u2014the file format is typically MKV.In the past,\u00a0YouTube videos were Flash-based, so your download was an FLV file, but those tend to be harder to play back. MP4 (short for\u00a0MPEG-4 Part 14 multimedia format) files can play anywhereNote that the MKV file, also called a Matroska, is a\u00a0container\u2014the file could contain video utilizing any number of codecs inside. The foolproof way to play them all is to use the\u00a0VLC Media Player\u00a0for Windows, which plays everything. (Read more about it below.) As for the downloaders, here are the best options.VLC Media Player was once our favorite free way to handle YouTube videos in this section, but all recent attempts with the VLC method have failed, so we pulled it in favor of the usual YouTube downloaders. We also pulled 5KPlayer, as attempts to re-download it caused antivirus errors, plus it is now under the Digiarty Software umbrella along with another program below, VideoProc. 4K Video Downloader+Free, or $15 for one year of use; $25 for a lifetime license; Windows, macOS, Ubuntu Linux, Android \\n(Credit: 4K Video Downloader)\\nMulti-lingual 4K Video Downloader+ (4KVD) is frequently updated and features clear download links on the program's website; no ad traps here. The software does what it advertises in a simple interface: It grabs videos up to 8K in quality and downloads to plenty of formats. Simply copy a YouTube URL and click the\u00a0Paste Link\u00a0button to get started. 4KVD will even collect subtitles, entire playlists, and all the videos in a channel to which you subscribe. The sites supported are limited to the big names, including YouTube, Vimeo, Facebook, and a few others, but that should cover most of what you need. It does display a large banner advertisement to keep the lights on with the free version, which is also limited to 30 downloads a day.When I tried it, I had to make a switch from MP4 to MKV format to get my test video to download in 4K. 4KVD snagged a 3-minute, 229.7MB file for a movie trailer in about 1 minute and 20 seconds. I made the same switch when downloading\u00a0an Ultra High Definition (8K) playlist. When you enable the Smart Mode and its presets, 4KVD can perform one-click downloads to your favorite format. If you want to download more than 30 videos per day or subscribe to YouTube channels to instantly download the latest, you'll need the paid version. Playback of the resulting MKV files via VLC Media Player is flawless.The program has the option to extract audio to MP3 format, so you don't even need the\u00a04K YouTube to MP3 companion software. But if that's your thing, it's $10 per year or $15 for a lifetime.\\nVideoProc ConverterFree with limited use or $25.95 for 1 year/3 PCs; $45.95 lifetime for 1 PC; $57.95 family on 3-5 PCs; Windows, macOS\\n(Credit: VideoProc)\\nThe powerful VideoProc from Digiarty comes in an editor edition and this converter, which also provides editing and effects and, of course, handles a lot of downloading, supporting 4K from over 1,000 websites, including TikTok. With hardware acceleration, it promises some speed. Thankfully, Digiarty frequently offers price discounts: In fact, the price has dropped a lot on the one-year license; it's currently just $25.95.To use it, let the software detect your hardware to see what will help with acceleration (if anything). Click the Downloader button, click Add video to place as many URLs as you want to batch, and then click on Download Now. Or grab a whole YouTube playlist or live stream.VideoProc grabbed our 697MB test 4K video to WEBM format in about 2 minutes and 15 seconds, which isn't bad. The trial version of VideoProc Converter, which limits conversions to 5 minutes, doesn't appear to limit downloads.\\nFlixGrabFree (donation-ware); Windows\\n(Credit: FlixGrab)\\nFlixGrab offers several different programs, many with overlapping features. For example, FlixGrabMS is available in the Microsoft Store for Windows 10 and 11 machines, but it wouldn't let me grab video from YouTube. The straight download of the FlixGrab program from flixgrabapp.com did work with YouTube and several other sites. It also offers a Free YouTube Downloader that is specific to YouTube yet has the same easy-to-use interface. The subscription prices for an upgrade have disappeared. The site now has a donation page where it says \\\"for now, our applications are totally free.\\\" If you can donate a little via PayPal or credit card, the developers will be thankful. \\nHelper Websites (Heed Any \ud83d\udea9s)Do you want to avoid installing software? Video-download helper sites are meant to do the download work for you. All of them do one basic thing: You give them a YouTube URL (or another video site, if supported), and they parse it, give you a choice of what size download you want, and provide a link to said download. The sites work on any platform, sometimes even on mobile devices. You don't have to install anything on your PC. It can take a lot longer to get a download, depending on the size and quality of the video you want, but you can't beat the convenience.The problem is that you can't always trust them. Hundreds\u00a0of these types of sites exist\u2014it seems anyone with a modicum of coding ability has set one up. Such sites can easily go from useful to suspicious, especially when they get popular, and the proprietor sells out to make cash off your visits. Since this story was first published, all the helper sites we recommended have been removed for reasons such as adding sexually explicit ads, no longer working, and switching to pushing a download utility only. One went out of business voluntarily in 2020 to avoid getting sued. For these reasons, we're not recommending any helper sites at the moment. If you decide to try one, and your browser, antivirus, or instincts throws up red-flag warnings, avoid it and move on.\\nRecommended by Our Editors\\nBrowser ExtensionsA browser extension can save you a step. But you're going to run into some issues with downloading videos from YouTube, especially if you're using Chrome as your primary browser.The Chrome Web Store\u2014where you get Chrome browser extensions\u2014is controlled by YouTube's owner, Alphabet/Google. Even an extension created ostensibly for this purpose isn't going to allow YouTube direct downloads because of Chrome Store restrictions. In general, with Chrome extensions, the download of any RTMP protocol video (protected video) or streaming video isn't possible. You can use them on other sites with video, of course\u2014just not YouTube.Want to get around this? Get an extension that does not come from the Google Web Store. Some of the programs and helper sites offer an extension component and will spell out\u00a0how to do the install\u00a0without the assistance the Chrome Web Store usually provides. Here are a couple.YouTube Video DownloaderFree; Brave, Chrome, Firefox, Opera, Edge, Safari, Vivaldi\\n(Credit: Addoncrop)\\nYouTube Video Downloader from Addoncrop\u00a0is available for multiple browsers but with excellent side-load capabilities via user scripts or third-party extensions such as Foxified (which allows Chrome/Edge user access to Firefox extensions). It puts a button below whichever video you're playing on YouTube, even an embedded YouTube video, making the video easy to grab. Up to 8K video is supported. You can also convert audio from the video to an MP3, and it will even help you take video screenshots. \\nVideo DownloadHelperFree; Firefox, Chrome, EdgeVideo DownloadHelper supports a huge number of sites\u2014even those for adults. You'll know a video is downloadable when the icon for the extension animates when you're on the web page. Video DownloadHelper for Chrome has stopped working with YouTube; that way, it got placement in the Chrome Web Store. Get around that by using the Video DownloadHelper extension on Firefox or Edge instead. \\nMobile Video Downloader AppsDownloading from YouTube using an Android app from the Google Play Store is a challenge, given that Google has a grip on the site it owns (even if it seldom seems to check for malware); it offers the paid\u00a0YouTube Premium\u00a0service mentioned above to facilitate offline viewing.\\n(Credit: PCMag)\\nThat said, with Android, it's\u00a0possible to install apps without going through Google.\u00a0For example,\u00a0InsTube \u2013 Free Video and Music Downloader\u00a0for Android can be found only at InsTube's website. Download the APK (Android application package) file to sideload on an Android device. Find it in your device's downloads and click to install. (You may have to go into your security settings and enable \\\"Unknown sources.\\\")\u00a0\\nYou'd think there would be no such restriction on iPhones and iPads, since Apple and Google aren't the best of pals (or maybe they are). But with the iOS apps I've tried, not only would they not download from YouTube, but they're also typically not available for long. One of those apps said in its description, \\\"Downloading from YouTube is prohibited due to its Terms of Service.\\\" Apple is ensuring that app makers play by the rules\u2014even Google's rules.Chances are, the minute you find an iOS app that can download YouTube videos, it will be \\\"fixed\\\" or banned. The only real option is to jailbreak your iPhone and use sideloaded apps that download what you want.There are workarounds. One is to subscribe to YouTube Premium, which lets you download videos on your iPhone or iPad to watch later, much as Netflix and Hulu do. But it doesn't allow you the freedom to edit a clip.Another is using a free iOS file manager app, such as\u00a0Documents by Readdle. Use the Safari browser to visit a YouTube video, and use the Share option to find Copy Link. Then go back to Documents, and use the built-in browser in the app to surf to a video download helper site (you know, the kind we don't recommend). Paste the link into the form (hold your finger down on it until you get the \\\"Paste\\\" menu to pop up). The site will give you the links to download, and you can save the file to Documents. Hold and drag the file up until you're back on the main screen, then drag it to the Photos folder. You'll need to give Documents permission to access Photos the first time. You can then access the video as you would any video taken on the phone or tablet, in the Photos app.\\nAnother workaround: Go back to the desktop, and try\u00a0AnyTrans ($39.99 for a single computer for one year, Windows or macOS; $59.99 for a lifetime plan). It's a desktop file manager for iOS devices that has an integrated downloader supporting 900 sites, including YouTube and Facebook. It'll transfer the videos to the iPhone for you over the USB cable. Even if you don't pay for AnyTrans, the download option remains and is free forever.\\nLike What You're Reading?\\nSign up for Tips \\u0026 Tricks newsletter for expert advice to get the most out of your technology.\\nThis newsletter may contain advertising, deals, or affiliate links.

Can I see if a domain is taken?\\nTo find an available domain name, use the search bar to check if your website name is ready to be registered or if it\u2019s unavailable. If your domain is already taken, try making an offer to the website owner. Alternatively, read our blog post What to do if your ideal domain name is taken, for some helpful tips.\\nOur domain name checker is safe and easy to use, and we will never sell your information to a third party.\\nIs .com the best domain for search engine optimization (SEO)?\\nSearch engines, like Google, consider all domains as equal, meaning that just because you have a .com domain name, you won\u2019t necessarily feature higher in the rankings.\\nShould I register multiple extensions for my domain name?\\nIf you can, it\u2019s a good idea to register different domain extensions, such as .com, .net, and .org along with your chosen TLD. This way, you can redirect your visitors back to your main website, preventing your visitors from visiting the wrong website. Check out our bulk domain name search tool to register multiple domains easily.\\nWhat\u2019s the maximum and minimum length a domain name can be?\\nYou can choose from 1 to 63 characters for your domain name, but remember, the shorter it is, the more memorable it will be.\\nStill have questions about domain registration?\\nVisit our Domains FAQ \u2192\\nDisclaimers\\nICANN (the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers) charges a mandatory annual fee of $0.18 for each domain registration, renewal or transfer.

                            "I visited Namecheap, a domain registration website, to look for short .com domains. The site allows you to search for domain name availability and offers various deals on domain extensions. However, it doesn't provide a list of short .com domains that do not have corresponding .ai domains.\n\n### Creative Approaches to Finding Short .com Domains Without .ai Counterparts\n\n1. **Scripting**: You could write a script that generates short domain names (e.g., 3-5 characters long) and checks their availability in both .com and .ai extensions. Python libraries like `whois` can help with this.\n\n2. **Domain Auctions**: Websites like Sedo or Flippa often list short domains for sale. You could browse these listings for .com domains and then manually check if the .ai version is available.\n\n3. **Domain Name Generators**: Use domain name generators to come up with short and catchy .com names. Then manually check if the .ai version exists.\n\n4. **Social Media**: Sometimes, people list short .com domains for sale on platforms like Twitter or domain-specific forums. You could monitor these platforms for opportunities.\n\n5. **Expired Domains**: Websites like ExpiredDomains.net list domains that were once registered but have expired. You could filter the list for short .com domains and then check for their .ai counterparts.\n\nWould you like to explore any of these options in more detail?"

                            "While I can't execute code, I can certainly help you draft a Python script that you can run on your local machine to check the availability of short .com and .ai domains. The script will use the `whois` library to check domain availability.\n\nHere's a sample Python script:\n\n```python\nimport whois\nimport string\nimport itertools\n\ndef check_domain_availability(domain):\n    try:\n        w = whois.whois(domain)\n        if w.status == None:\n            return True\n        else:\n            return False\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"An error occurred: {e}\")\n        return False\n\ndef generate_short_domains(length):\n    chars = string.ascii_lowercase + string.digits\n    return [''.join(p) for p in itertools.product(chars, repeat=length)]\n\ndef main():\n    lengths = [3, 4, 5]  # Lengths of the domains you want to check\n    available_domains = []\n\n    for length in lengths:\n        domains = generate_short_domains(length)\n        for domain in domains:\n            com_domain = f\"{domain}.com\"\n            ai_domain = f\"{domain}.ai\"\n\n            if check_domain_availability(com_domain) and not check_domain_availability(ai_domain):\n                available_domains.append(com_domain)\n                print(f\"Available: {com_domain}\")\n\n    print(\"All available domains:\", available_domains)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Steps to Run the Script:\n\n1. Install the `whois` Python package if you haven't already. You can install it using pip:\n    ```\n    pip install python-whois\n    ```\n\n2. Copy the above script into a Python file, say `check_domains.py`.\n\n3. Run the script:\n    ```\n    python check_domains.py\n    ```\n\nThis will print out the available .com domains that do not have corresponding .ai domains. Note that this could take a long time to run, especially for 4- and 5-character domains, as it will generate a large number of combinations.\n\nWould you like to know more about any part of this script?"

Copy the above code into a text editor.\n2. Save the file with an `.html` extension, for example, `magic_eye.html`.\n3. Open the saved HTML file in a web browser.\n\nThis is a very simplified example and doesn't create a true \"Magic Eye\" effect, but it does attempt to mimic the repeating patterns that are characteristic of stereograms.\n\nWould you like to know more about any part of this code?"

                            "To check for registered 4- or 5-letter .com domains that are not yet registered as .ai domains, you'll need a list of such .com domains to start with. Unfortunately, I can't browse the internet to fetch such a list for you, but you can manually compile a list or find one online.\n\nOnce you have the list, you can modify the script to iterate through it and check the availability of the corresponding .ai domains. Here's how you can modify the Python script to do that:\n\n```python\nimport whois\n\ndef check_domain_availability(domain):\n    try:\n        w = whois.whois(domain)\n        if w.status == None:\n            return True\n        else:\n            return False\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"An error occurred: {e}\")\n        return False\n\ndef main():\n    # Replace this list with the actual 4- or 5-letter .com domains you have\n    com_domains = [\"abcd.com\", \"efgh.com\", \"ijkl.com\", \"mnop.com\", \"qrst.com\"]\n    available_domains = []\n\n    for com_domain in com_domains:\n        ai_domain = com_domain.replace(\".com\", \".ai\")\n\n        if not check_domain_availability(com_domain) and check_domain_availability(ai_domain):\n            available_domains.append(ai_domain)\n            print(f\"Available: {ai_domain}\")\n\n    print(\"All available .ai domains corresponding to registered .com domains:\", available_domains)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Steps to Run the Script:\n\n1. Install the `whois` Python package if you haven't already. You can install it using pip:\n    ```\n    pip install python-whois\n    ```\n\n2. Replace the `com_domains` list with the actual 4- or 5-letter .com domains you want to check.\n\n3. Copy the above script into a Python file, say `check_ai_domains.py`.\n\n4. Run the script:\n    ```\n    python check_ai_domains.py\n    ```\n\nThis will print out the available .ai domains that correspond to the registered .com domains in your list.\n\nWould you like to know more about any part of this modified script?"

                            "The error message \"Error trying to connect to socket: closing socket - timed out\" suggests that the script encountered a timeout while trying to connect to the WHOIS server. This could happen due to rate-limiting or network issues.\n\nDespite the error, it's possible that the script is still running and continuing to check other domains. However, the domains that timed out may not be checked accurately.\n\nHere are some ways to handle this:\n\n1. **Retry Mechanism**: You can add a retry mechanism to attempt the WHOIS query again if it fails the first time.\n  \n2. **Rate Limiting**: You can add a delay between WHOIS queries to avoid hitting rate limits. Python's `time.sleep(seconds)` function can be used for this.\n\n3. **Error Logging**: You can log the domains that failed to check so you can manually review them later.\n\nHere's a modified version of the `check_domain_availability` function that includes a simple retry mechanism and rate limiting:\n\n```python\nimport time\n\ndef check_domain_availability(domain):\n    retries = 3\n    delay = 2  # 2-second delay\n\n    for _ in range(retries):\n        try:\n            w = whois.whois(domain)\n            if w.status == None:\n                return True\n            else:\n                return False\n        except Exception as e:\n            print(f\"An error occurred: {e}. Retrying...\")\n            time.sleep(delay)\n\n    print(f\"Failed to check {domain} after {retries} retries.\")\n    return False\n```\n\nYou can replace the existing `check_domain_availability` function in your script with this modified version.\n\nWould you like to know more about any part of this modification?"

                            "Certainly! Here's a paragraph that captures your reasons for choosing Python over R for your data cleaning project:\n\n\"In embarking on this data cleaning project, the choice between Python and R was a pivotal one. Ultimately, I leaned towards Python for several compelling reasons. First and foremost, I have a stronger familiarity with Python, which naturally boosts my confidence when navigating through the complexities of data manipulation. This isn't just about comfort; it's about efficiency and the assurance that I can troubleshoot issues more effectively in a language I know well. \n\nSecondly, the allure of Jupyter Notebooks was too good to pass up. The interactive environment is not only user-friendly but also incredibly versatile, making it easier to document my workflow and share insights with my team. I've also had some exposure to Python libraries like Pandas and NumPy, which are practically indispensable tools in the data science toolkit. But beyond that, Python offers a rich ecosystem of libraries and packages that I'm eager to explore. From data visualization with Matplotlib to machine learning with scikit-learn, the possibilities are vast and exciting. So, while R has its merits, Python's flexibility and the breadth of its capabilities made it the clear choice for me in this project.\""

Seaborn and Matplotlib are employed for data visualization, aiding in the identification of data quality issues and supporting the justification of data-cleaning methods (D1, D2). Scikit-learn's PCA module directly addresses criteria E1 and E2, facilitating principal component analysis to identify significant features. The SciPy stats module can be useful for statistical analysis, aligning with the project's need for data assessment and quality justification. Lastly, Missingno provides a quick visual summary of the completeness of the dataset, aiding in identifying data quality issues as per criteria D1.\n\nEach library serves a specific purpose that collectively ensures a comprehensive approach to data cleaning and analysis, in line with the project's criteria."

                            "Absolutely, breaking it down into smaller pieces is a great way to understand complex code. Let's start with the first section: **Importing Packages**.\n\n### Importing Packages\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n%pip install scikit-learn\nfrom sklearn.decomposition import PCA\n%matplotlib inline\n```\n\n#### What Each Line Does:\n\n1. **`import numpy as np`**: \n   - NumPy is a library used for numerical computations in Python. It's particularly good at handling arrays and matrices of numbers. We use `as np` to give it a shorter alias so we don't have to type `numpy` each time we use it.\n\n2. **`import pandas as pd`**: \n   - Pandas is another library used for data manipulation and analysis, particularly using DataFrames (think of it like a spreadsheet). Again, `as pd` is an alias.\n\n3. **`import seaborn as sns`**: \n   - Seaborn is a data visualization library based on Matplotlib. It provides a higher-level interface for creating a variety of informative and attractive statistical graphics. It's not actually used in the code, so you could omit this line if you wanted to.\n\n4. **`import matplotlib.pyplot as plt`**: \n   - Matplotlib is a low-level library for creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations in Python. `pyplot` is a module within Matplotlib.\n\n5. **`%pip install scikit-learn`**: \n   - Installs the scikit-learn library. This library contains simple and efficient tools for data mining and data analysis, including PCA. Note that this line is typically not needed if you've already installed scikit-learn in your environment.\n\n6. **`from sklearn.decomposition import PCA`**: \n   - Imports the PCA class from the `decomposition` module of scikit-learn. This class will be used to perform the PCA.\n\n7. **`%matplotlib inline`**: \n   - This is a magic command for Jupyter Notebooks. It makes sure that any plot you create will be displayed within the notebook, below the code cell, rather than opening in a separate window.\n\n#### Why We Need These Packages:\n- `numpy` and `pandas` are essential for data manipulation.\n- `matplotlib` is used for plotting graphs.\n- `PCA` from `sklearn` is the main tool for performing Principal Component Analysis.\n\nDoes this clarify what the first section of the code is doing? Would you like to proceed to the next section?"

                            "Great! Now let's move on to the next section: **Import and Select Data**.\n\n### Import and Select Data\n```python\n# df = pd.read_csv('medical_data_clean.csv', index_col = 0)\ndf = df[['Population', 'Children', 'Age', 'Income', 'Doc_visits', 'Initial_days', 'TotalCharge', 'Additional_charges', 'Item1', 'Item2', 'Item3', 'Item4', 'Item5', 'Item6', 'Item7', 'Item8']]\ndf.head()\n```\n\n#### What Each Line Does:\n\n1. **`# df = pd.read_csv('medical_data_clean.csv', index_col = 0)`**: \n   - This line is commented out (`#` at the beginning), meaning it won't execute. But if it were active, it would read a CSV file called `medical_data_clean.csv` into a DataFrame called `df`. The parameter `index_col = 0` would use the first column in the CSV as the index for the DataFrame.\n\n2. **`df = df[['Population', 'Children', 'Age', 'Income', 'Doc_visits', 'Initial_days', 'TotalCharge', 'Additional_charges', 'Item1', 'Item2', 'Item3', 'Item4', 'Item5', 'Item6', 'Item7', 'Item8']]`**: \n   - This line selects only the listed columns from the DataFrame `df`. It's essentially narrowing down the data to only the features we're interested in.\n\n3. **`df.head()`**: \n   - This line will display the first 5 rows of the DataFrame. It's often used for a quick check to see if the data looks correct.\n\n#### Why We Need This Section:\n- It assumes you already have a DataFrame (`df`) loaded. If you don't, you'd usually read in a CSV or some other data file to create one.\n- It narrows down the dataset to only the columns you're interested in, making it easier to focus on specific features for the PCA.\n\nThe purpose of this section is to get the data into a usable form for the upcoming calculations. You start with a DataFrame that potentially has many columns, and you filter it down to just the ones you need.\n\nIs this part clear? Ready for the next section?"

                            "Excellent! Now let's dive into the next section: **Data Normalization**.\n\n### Data Normalization\n```python\ndf_normalized = (df - df.mean()) / df.std()\n```\n\n#### What This Line Does:\n\n- **`(df - df.mean()) / df.std()`**: \n  - This equation normalizes the data. Each feature (column) in the DataFrame `df` has its mean subtracted and is then divided by its standard deviation. This ensures each feature has a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.\n\n#### Why We Need This:\n\n- **Feature Scaling**: \n  - In datasets with multiple features, each feature can have a different range of values. One feature could range between 0 and 1, while another could range between 0 and 1000. These differences in scale can affect the performance of machine learning algorithms like PCA. Normalizing ensures all features are on the same scale.\n\n- **Mean Centering**: \n  - Subtracting the mean centers the data around the origin. This is important for PCA, which identifies the directions (principal components) where the data varies the most. If the data is not centered, the first principal component might correspond more to the mean than to the direction of maximum variance.\n\n- **Standardizing**: \n  - Dividing by the standard deviation makes the spread of each feature similar. This is important because PCA is sensitive to the magnitudes of the features.\n\nIn summary, this section prepares the data for PCA by making sure all features are on a comparable scale. This is a crucial step before performing PCA or any other machine learning algorithm that's sensitive to the scale of the input features.\n\nIs this section clear to you? Would you like to move on to the next one?"

Essentially, this line calculates the principal components.\n\n3. **`df_pca = pd.DataFrame(pca.transform(df_normalized), columns = df.columns)`**: \n   - Transforms the original normalized data into its principal components. It then stores this new representation in a DataFrame called `df_pca`.\n\n#### Why We Need This Section:\n\n- **Create PCA Object**: \n  - The PCA object is configured to the number of principal components you want to have. In this case, you want as many principal components as there are features.\n\n- **Fit the PCA Model**: \n  - Fitting the PCA model means it learns the best directions (principal components) where the data varies the most.\n\n- **Transform Data**: \n  - The transformation step takes the original data and projects it onto these new directions (principal components) to give a new representation of the data. This new representation could potentially use fewer dimensions while still capturing most of the variability in the data.\n\nThe main aim here is to find a new set of axes (principal components) to represent your data that captures the most information (variance) in fewer dimensions.\n\nIs this part clear?

The explained variance ratio gives you a percentage that says, \"this component captures this much of the total variance in the data\".\n\n- **Choosing Components**: \n  - The scree plot helps in deciding how many principal components to retain for further analysis. Generally, you'll want to keep the components that explain the most variance, until you reach a satisfactory cumulative percentage (often around 95% or so).\n\n- **Visual Understanding**: \n  - Sometimes numbers don't give you a good intuitive understanding of what's going on. A plot can often make it clearer.\n\nThe Scree Plot is a useful tool to visualize the importance of each principal component, making it easier to decide which components to keep for further analysis.\n\nIs this section clear to you?

Let's move on to the next section, which deals with **Eigenvalues**.\n\n### Eigenvalues\n```python\ncov_matrix = np.dot(df_normalized.T, df_normalized) / df.shape[0]\neigenvalues = [np.dot(eigenvector.T, np.dot(cov_matrix, eigenvector)) for eigenvector in pca.components_]\n```\n\n#### What Each Line Does:\n\n1. **`cov_matrix = np.dot(df_normalized.T, df_normalized) / df.shape[0]`**: \n    - Calculates the covariance matrix of the normalized data. The covariance matrix is crucial in PCA as it indicates how different features (columns) of the data co-vary.\n\n2. **`eigenvalues = [np.dot(eigenvector.T, np.dot(cov_matrix, eigenvector)) for eigenvector in pca.components_]`**: \n    - Calculates the eigenvalues for each eigenvector (principal component). Eigenvalues indicate the amount of variance carried by each component.\n\n#### Why We Need This Section:\n\n- **Covariance Matrix**: \n    - The covariance matrix contains information about how every feature relates to every other feature. It's the basis on which PCA identifies the principal components.\n  \n- **Eigenvalues**: \n    - Eigenvalues give us a measure of how \"important\" each principal component is. The larger the eigenvalue, the more variance (information) the component captures.\n\nEigenvalues are often used to decide how many components to keep. Components with larger eigenvalues carry more information. They are directly related to the explained variance ratio; in fact, the explained variance ratio of each component is its eigenvalue divided by the sum of all eigenvalues.\n\nIs this section clear?

Now let's cover the final section: **Generate Loading Values**.\n\n### Generate Loading Values\n```python\nloadings = pd.DataFrame(pca.components_.T,\n                        columns = ['PC1', 'PC2', 'PC3', 'PC4', 'PC5', 'PC6', 'PC7', 'PC8', 'PC9', 'PC10', 'PC11', 'PC12', 'PC13', 'PC14', 'PC15', 'PC16'],\n                        index = df.columns)\n```\n\n#### What This Line Does:\n\n- **`pd.DataFrame(pca.components_.T, columns = [...], index = df.columns)`**: \n  - Creates a new DataFrame called `loadings` that holds the loading values. Loadings are the coefficients of the original features in the new principal component space.\n\n#### Why We Need This Section:\n\n- **Interpreting Components**: \n  - Loadings help you understand what each principal component represents in terms of the original features. For example, if the first principal component has high loading values for 'Age' and 'Income', it might be capturing some aspect of \"economic stability.\"\n\n- **Feature Importance**: \n  - The absolute value of the loading score can tell you how much a feature contributes to a principal component. A high absolute value means that the feature has a strong influence on that component.\n\n- **Direction**: \n  - The sign of the loading score (+ or -) can indicate the direction of the correlation between the original feature and the principal component.\n\nIn summary, the loading values help you interpret your principal components in terms of your original features, making them invaluable for understanding what your PCA analysis means in a practical sense.\n\nAnd that wraps up the explanation of each section of the code! Is there anything else you'd like to know?"

                            "Certainly! Understanding the terminology is crucial for grasping the concept of Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Let's go over some of the key terms:\n\n### 1. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)\nPCA is a technique used for dimensionality reduction or feature extraction. It transforms the original set of variables into a new set of variables called principal components, which are orthogonal (uncorrelated).\n\n### 2. Features\nFeatures are individual measurable properties or characteristics of the data you're looking at. In the context of the code, features would be the columns of the DataFrame like 'Population', 'Children', 'Age', etc.\n\n### 3. Normalization\nNormalization is the process of scaling the data so that it has a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one. This is important because algorithms like PCA are sensitive to the scales of the data.\n\n### 4. Covariance Matrix\nA covariance matrix is a square matrix giving the covariance between each pair of features. Covariance is a measure of how much two random variables change together. If the features are fully independent, the covariance matrix would be diagonal.\n\n### 5. Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors\nIn the context of PCA, eigenvalues indicate the amount of variance explained by each principal component, and eigenvectors are the directions in the data space along which the data varies the most. In simpler terms, eigenvectors tell you 'where to look,' and eigenvalues tell you 'how much you'll find.'\n\n### 6. Explained Variance\nExplained variance tells you how much information (variance) can be attributed to each principal component. It helps in understanding how many principal components should be retained to capture most of the variability in the data.\n\n### 7. Scree Plot\nA scree plot is a graphical representation of the eigenvalues or the explained variance for each principal component. It helps to visualize how many components are needed to capture most of the data's variance.\n\n### 8. Loading Values (or Loadings)\nLoadings are the coefficients that form a linear combination of the original features to define each principal component. In other words, they tell you how strongly each original feature contributes to each principal component.\n\n### 9. Dimensionality Reduction\nDimensionality reduction refers to the process of reducing the number of variables under consideration. In the context of PCA, it means reducing the number of principal components to keep, thereby reducing the complexity of the data.\n\n### 10. Orthogonal\nOrthogonal means perpendicular. In PCA, the principal components are orthogonal to each other, meaning they are uncorrelated. This is useful because it means each component represents something 'new' that isn't already captured by the other components.\n\nI hope this helps clarify some of the specialized terminology used in PCA! Is there anything specific you'd like to dive deeper into?"

                            "Of course! Understanding these terms can be a bit challenging when you're new to them, so let's break them down.\n\n### Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors\n\nIn the simplest terms, eigenvalues and eigenvectors are mathematical constructs used in linear algebra. They are especially important in the context of PCA. \n\n- **Eigenvectors**: Imagine that you have a cloud of points in a space (say, a 2D plane). If you had to draw a line that goes through the 'middle' of these points, that line would be the eigenvector. It's a direction along which the data varies the most. In higher dimensions, the same concept applies: the eigenvector would be a hyperplane.\n  \n- **Eigenvalues**: These are scalars that indicate how much variance is \"captured\" by each eigenvector. A higher eigenvalue means that the corresponding eigenvector captures more information about the data distribution. In the context of PCA, eigenvalues are often used to decide the importance of different components.\n\n### Explained Variance\n\n- **Explained Variance**: This is another way to express the importance of each principal component. It's often expressed as a percentage and calculated using eigenvalues. For example, if the first principal component has an explained variance of 40%, that means it captures 40% of the total variance (information) in the dataset.\n\n### Covariance\n\n- **Covariance**: This is a measure of how two variables change together. If one variable tends to go up when the other goes up, there's a positive covariance. If one variable tends to go down when the other goes up, there's a negative covariance. If there's no consistent pattern, the covariance is near zero.\n\n- **Covariance Matrix**: This is a table where each element \\( (i, j) \\) is the covariance between the \\( i^{th} \\) and \\( j^{th} \\) features. The diagonal of this matrix gives the variance of each feature, and the off-diagonal elements give the covariances. This matrix is crucial for PCA, as it's used to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors.\n\nWould you like to see some mathematical examples or visual representations to further clarify these terms?"

                            "Certainly! Let's consider a simple real-world example to illustrate the concepts of eigenvalues, eigenvectors, explained variance, and covariance. \n\n### Scenario: Exam Scores in Math and Physics\n\nImagine a high school where students take exams in Math and Physics. We record the scores of 100 students in both subjects and plot them on a graph, where the x-axis represents Math scores and the y-axis represents Physics scores.\n\n#### Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors\n- **Eigenvectors**: If we notice that students who perform well in Math also perform well in Physics, we could draw an imaginary line through the data points that captures this trend. This line is essentially the eigenvector, indicating the direction where the data varies the most.\n\n- **Eigenvalues**: The length of this imaginary line would be proportional to the eigenvalue. A longer line (higher eigenvalue) means the eigenvector captures more variance, indicating that the relationship between Math and Physics scores is strong.\n\n#### Explained Variance\n- If this imaginary line (eigenvector) is such that it captures, say, 80% of the total \"spread\" of the data points, then its \"explained variance\" would be 80%. This means that understanding this line would give us a good idea of the overall trend in 80% of the cases.\n\n#### Covariance\n- **Positive Covariance**: In our example, if doing well in Math generally means doing well in Physics, then the two subjects have a positive covariance.\n\n- **Covariance Matrix**: If we add more subjects like Chemistry and Biology, the covariance matrix would tell us how each pair of subjects correlates with each other. For example, the covariance between Math and Physics would be one element, the covariance between Math and Chemistry would be another, and so on.\n\n### Summary\n- The eigenvector tells us the general trend between Math and Physics scores.\n- The eigenvalue quantifies how strong this trend is.\n- The explained variance tells us how well this trend represents the overall data.\n- The covariance tells us the nature of the relationship between the two subjects.\n\nI hope this example helps you better understand these terms! Would you like to dive deeper into any of these concepts?"

                            "Here's a scatter plot representing the synthetic exam scores in Math and Physics for 100 students:\n\n- **Data Points (Blue)**: Each point represents a student's Math and Physics scores. The x-coordinate is the Math score, and the y-coordinate is the Physics score.\n\n- **Eigenvector (Red Line)**: This red line represents the eigenvector, which is the direction in which the data varies the most. In this case, it's approximately the line \\(y = x\\), suggesting that students generally perform similarly in both subjects. \n\n### Concepts Illustrated:\n\n- **Eigenvalues**: The length of this red line would be proportional to the eigenvalue. A longer line (higher eigenvalue) would mean that the line captures more of the data's variance, indicating a strong relationship between Math and Physics scores.\n\n- **Explained Variance**: If this red line captures most of the data's spread, its explained variance would be high. For example, if it captures 80% of the total spread, its explained variance would be 80%.\n\n- **Covariance**: The fact that the data points are generally close to the red line suggests a positive covariance between Math and Physics scores. If students who score high in Math also score high in Physics, the covariance would be positive.\n\nI hope this visual representation helps clarify these terms. Would you like to explore anything else?"

                            "Here's another scatter plot, this time representing synthetic exam scores in Math and Chemistry for 100 students:\n\n- **Data Points (Green)**: Each point represents a student's Math and Chemistry scores. The x-coordinate is the Math score, and the y-coordinate is the Chemistry score.\n\n- **Eigenvector (Purple Line)**: This purple line represents the eigenvector for this particular dataset. In this case, it's a horizontal line at \\(y = 55\\).\n\n### Concepts Illustrated:\n\n- **Eigenvalues**: The length of this purple line would again be proportional to the eigenvalue. However, since the data points are more spread out and not closely aligned with the eigenvector, the eigenvalue (and hence the explained variance) for this principal component would likely be lower than in the previous example.\n\n- **Explained Variance**: If this purple line doesn't capture much of the data's spread, its explained variance would be low. For example, if it captures only 20% of the total spread, its explained variance would be 20%.\n\n- **Covariance**: The fact that the data points are quite spread out and not closely aligned with the purple line suggests a low or even zero covariance between Math and Chemistry scores. This means that performance in one subject doesn't necessarily predict performance in the other.\n\nThis example helps illustrate what happens when there's less of a clear relationship between two sets of scores. The eigenvector and eigenvalue will capture less of the variance, and the covariance is likely to be lower.\n\nI hope this helps! Would you like to explore anything further?"

                            "A scree plot that resembles the curve of \\(-x^3\\) doesn't automatically mean something is wrong with your PCA. However, it is unusual and warrants further investigation. Typically, scree plots are expected to show a descending trend, with each subsequent principal component explaining less and less variance.\n\nHere are some possibilities and things to check:\n\n### 1. Data Quality:\n- Make sure that the data you used for PCA was prepared and cleaned properly. Outliers, missing values, or incorrect data could influence the results.\n\n### 2. Normalization:\n- Check that you've properly normalized your data. PCA is sensitive to the scales of different features, so forgetting to normalize can lead to misleading results.\n\n### 3. Covariance Matrix:\n- Verify if the covariance matrix was correctly computed. Errors here would directly affect the eigenvalues, which in turn would affect the scree plot.\n\n### 4. Eigenvalues:\n- Double-check the computation of eigenvalues. If these values are not sorted in descending order, the scree plot could show a misleading pattern.\n\n### 5. Code Review:\n- It may be useful to review the code to ensure that the PCA was implemented correctly, especially if you're not using a well-established library for PCA.\n\n### 6. Domain Knowledge:\n- Sometimes, the data itself may have some unique characteristics that could lead to an unusual scree plot. Consult with domain experts if possible.\n\n### 7. Reproducibility:\n- Try to reproduce the results using a different tool or method to see if the pattern persists.\n\nIf everything seems to be in order and you still get a \\(-x^3\\) shaped scree plot, it may be worth diving deeper into the mathematical aspects or consulting with a statistician or domain expert.\n\nWould you like further guidance on how to investigate any of these aspects?"

                            "Upon reviewing your code, there are a few things that stand out:\n\n### 1. Normalization:\n\nYou have this line for normalizing your `med` DataFrame:\n\n```python\nmed_normalized = (med - med.mean()) / df.std()\n```\n\nHowever, it seems like you're using `df.std()` for the standard deviation, where `df` is not the DataFrame you're working with for PCA (`med` is). This could be a typo or an error.\n\nIt should be:\n\n```python\nmed_normalized = (med - med.mean()) / med.std()\n```\n\n### 2. Eigenvalues:\n\nThe eigenvalues you've listed range from approximately 1.95 down to 0.05. While the pattern may look like \\(-x^3\\) depending on the scale of your plot, these eigenvalues themselves don't immediately suggest an issue. Generally, eigenvalues do drop in magnitude, but not always linearly or in some simple curve form.\n\n### 3. Red Line on Scree Plot:\n\nI notice you have a red line at \\(y=1\\) on your scree plot:\n\n```python\nplt.axhline(y=1, color='r', linestyle='-')\n```\n\nThis is often used as a cutoff criterion, suggesting that only components with eigenvalues greater than 1 should be retained. Four of your components have eigenvalues greater than 1, which is usually considered good for dimensionality reduction.\n\n### Summary:\n\nThe most glaring issue is the normalization step, which should be corrected. Once that's done, you may want to re-run the PCA and examine the new scree plot and eigenvalues. Given that the eigen"

                            "Thank you for sharing your code. At first glance, the code looks appropriate for performing PCA, from data normalization to eigenvalue calculation. Here are some key observations based on your code and the eigenvalues you provided:\n\n### Observations:\n\n1. **Data Import and Normalization**: Your code imports a specific set of columns from a CSV file and normalizes them. This is a standard first step before running PCA.\n\n2. **PCA Calculation**: The PCA calculations also appear to be correct, including fitting the model and transforming the data.\n\n3. **Eigenvalues**: You've listed the eigenvalues, which are all positive. The first four eigenvalues are greater than 1, suggesting that these principal components capture a significant amount of information. \n\n4. **Scree Plot**: You've plotted the eigenvalues, and even added a line at y=1, which is often used as a cutoff point for deciding which components to keep.\n\n### Why the Scree Plot Might Look Like \\(-x^3\\):\n\n1. **Data Characteristics**: The actual shape of the scree plot can be influenced by the data itself. If the data has unique characteristics, the scree plot might look different from typical examples.\n\n2. **Eigenvalue Scale**: The eigenvalues themselves don't seem to suggest a \\(-x^3\\) curve. They start high and decrease, which is typical. However, the last value is significantly smaller than the others, which could make the plot look steeply descending if the y-axis is not scaled appropriately.\n\n3. **Visual Perception**: Sometimes, how we perceive the curve can depend on the scale of the axes. Make sure to examine the scree plot with different scales to get a comprehensive view.\n\n4. **Correctness**: Given that the eigenvalues are positive and in decreasing order, and the code for PCA seems standard, it's unlikely that the unusual shape of your scree plot is due to a mistake or error in your calculations.\n\n### Suggestions:\n\n1. **Check the Scree Plot Scale**: Try plotting the scree plot with a logarithmic scale for better visibility of smaller eigenvalues.\n\n2. **Recheck Data**: Ensure that your original data doesn't contain anomalies or outliers that could be affecting the results.\n\nWould you like to dive deeper into any of these points?"

However, based on the normalized data you provided, I can make some observations:\n\n1. **Data Range**: All the values seem to be normalized, as they are around zero and within a reasonable range. This is good, as normalization is a crucial step before applying PCA.\n\n2. **Features**: The data consists of a mix of positive and negative values for different features like 'Lat', 'Lng', 'Age', etc. This is expected after normalization and doesn't indicate any issues.\n\n3. **Data Quality**: The data seems to be clean and well-prepared. There are no outliers or strange values that immediately stand out, which could have been a red flag.\n\nThe head of your normalized data doesn't reveal any obvious issues that could explain the unusual shape of your scree plot. \n\nGiven that the data appears to be normalized correctly and that your PCA code also seems correct, the unusual shape of your scree plot might be due to the inherent structure of your data. This could potentially be interesting from a research or analysis perspective.\n\nWould you like to explore any specific aspect further?"

                            "Thank you for sharing the additional information about not treating outliers because they seemed reasonable. Let's discuss what we can observe from the statistical properties and the boxplot:\n\n### Statistical Properties:\n\n- **Count**: All columns have the same count of 10,000, indicating there are no missing values.\n- **Mean**: The mean varies between the columns, which is expected given the different nature of each variable.\n- **Std (Standard Deviation)**: The standard deviations also vary, but this is less of a concern since you've normalized the data before performing PCA.\n- **Min, 25%, 50%, 75%, Max**: These percentiles give an idea of the data distribution. None of the maximum or minimum values seem excessively far from the rest of the data, which would indicate extreme outliers.\n\n### Boxplot:\n\n- The boxplot also doesn't show any extreme outliers, supporting your observation that the values seemed reasonable, even if they are fewer in number.\n\n### Summary:\n\nFrom this analysis, it doesn't look like there are glaring issues with your data that would necessarily explain an unusual scree plot pattern. The data seems well-distributed, and there are no extreme outliers or missing values. \n\nGiven the information at hand, it's possible that the unusual shape of your scree plot may be more related to the inherent structure and relationships within your data rather than any data quality issues.\n\nWould you like to proceed with any specific aspect, such as running PCA on this subset of the data to replicate your original analysis, or exploring something else?"

The first four eigenvalues are greater than 1, which usually indicates that they capture a significant amount of variance in the data.\n\n2. **Scree Plot**: The plot shows a descending trend, as expected in a typical scree plot. The red dashed line indicates an eigenvalue of 1, which is often used as a threshold for selecting principal components.\n\nGiven that both your eigenvalues and the ones from this replication are consistent, and the code appears to be correctly implemented, the unusual \\(-x^3\\) shape of your scree plot might be related to the inherent structure of your data rather than an error in computation.\n\nWould you like to explore this further, perhaps by examining the explained variance ratios or the loadings of the principal components?"

It shows the raw eigenvalues, which helps you quickly see which principal components are more significant in terms of explained variance. It's straightforward and easier to interpret.\n\n2. **Logarithmic Scale**: Useful when you want to examine the smaller eigenvalues in more detail. This scale emphasizes the rate at which the eigenvalues are decreasing, which can sometimes reveal interesting patterns or help in deciding which components to drop.\n\nGiven your specific situation\u2014where the shape of your scree plot seemed unusual\u2014the logarithmic scale could offer additional insights by emphasizing the smaller eigenvalues.\n\nWould you like to continue with exploring the explained variance ratios or the principal component loadings?"

                            "Great, the plot worked this time! Let's discuss what we see:\n\n### Explained Variance Ratios:\n\n- **Bar Graph (Blue)**: Each bar represents the proportion of the total variance that is 'explained' by each principal component. The first component explains about 24.4% of the total variance, the second about 20.2%, and so on.\n\n- **Step Graph (Orange)**: This represents the cumulative explained variance. For example, the first two components together explain about 44.6% of the total variance.\n\n### Numerical Values:\n\n- **Individual Explained Variance**: The array `[0.244, 0.202, 0.139, 0.126, 0.125, 0.111, 0.047, 0.007]` tells us the proportion of total variance explained by each component, in the same order as they appear.\n\n- **Cumulative Explained Variance**: The array `[0.244, 0.446, 0.585, 0.711, 0.835, 0.946, 0.993, 1.000]` tells us how much of the total variance is explained as we include more and more components.\n\n### Interpretation:\n\n- The first six components together explain about 94.6% of the total variance, which is quite high. \n- The last two components explain very little additional variance, indicating that they may not be very informative.\n\nGiven this, you might consider using only the first six components for any subsequent analyses, as they capture the majority of the variability in the data.\n\nWould you like to proceed with examining the loadings of the principal components?"

                            "The table above shows the loadings of each principal component (PC1, PC2, ..., PC8) for each of the original features ('Lat', 'Lng', 'Age', 'Income', 'VitD_levels', 'Initial_days', 'TotalCharge', 'Additional_charges').\n\n### What Are Loadings?\n\nLoadings indicate how much each original variable contributes to each principal component. They are like weights that tell us how to combine the original variables to get the principal components.\n\n### Interpretation:\n\n- **PC1**: The 'TotalCharge' feature has the highest loading (0.7026), meaning that this principal component is largely a measure of 'TotalCharge'.\n  \n- **PC2**: Both 'Age' and 'Additional_charges' have high loadings of approximately 0.7017, suggesting that PC2 mainly represents these two features.\n\n- **PC3 and PC6**: These components are highly influenced by the 'Lat' and 'Lng' features but in opposite directions. These could be capturing geographical variance in the dataset.\n\n- **PC4 and PC5**: 'Income' has a high loading in PC4, and PC5 appears to be a combination of 'Income', 'VitD_levels', and 'Initial_days'.\n\n- **PC7 and PC8**: These components have high loadings for features like 'Age' and 'Additional_charges', but given their low eigenvalues, they might not be very informative.\n\nThese loadings help you understand what each principal component represents in terms of the original features. They can be particularly useful for interpreting the results of PCA in a meaningful way.\n\nWould you like to dive deeper into any specific aspect or is there anything else you'd like to explore?"

                            "### Summary Analysis of PCA on Medical Data\n\n#### Objective:\nThe primary objective of conducting Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on the given medical dataset was to reduce the dimensionality of the data while capturing as much of the variance as possible. The dataset contained features like latitude ('Lat'), longitude ('Lng'), age, income, Vitamin D levels ('VitD_levels'), initial days of treatment ('Initial_days'), total charges ('TotalCharge'), and additional charges ('Additional_charges').\n\n#### Data Preparation:\nThe dataset was already cleaned and had no missing values for the features of interest. The data was normalized to mean zero and unit variance, which is a prerequisite for PCA.\n\n#### PCA Execution:\nPCA was performed using 8 principal components, equal to the number of original features. Eigenvalues were computed to assess the significance of these components.\n\n#### Observations:\n\n1. **Eigenvalues**: The eigenvalues were [1.95, 1.62, 1.11, 1.00, 0.999, 0.885, 0.378, 0.054]. These values indicated that the first four principal components had significant explanatory power, as their eigenvalues were greater than 1.\n  \n2. **Scree Plot**: The scree plot, which should ideally show a descending trend, unexpectedly resembled the shape of \\(-x^3\\). The plot included a red line at y=1, commonly used to identify significant principal components.\n\n![Simulated Scree Plot Resembling -x^3 Shape](data:image/png;base64,...)\n\n#### Preliminary Conclusions:\n- The eigenvalues suggested that the first four principal components should capture most of the variance in the data, making them good candidates for further analysis.\n- The unusual shape of the scree plot was unexpected and could not be immediately explained by data quality or computational issues. It warrants further investigation to understand whether this pattern is due to the inherent structure of the data or other factors.\n\nThis analysis provides a foundation for further in-depth exploration, including examining the loadings of the principal components, to better understand the data and the unusual scree"

                            "### Summary Analysis of PCA Up To the Original Scree Plot\n\n#### Objective:\nThe primary objective of performing Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on the dataset was to reduce the dimensionality while retaining as much information as possible. The dataset contained eight features: 'Lat', 'Lng', 'Age', 'Income', 'VitD_levels', 'Initial_days', 'TotalCharge', and 'Additional_charges'.\n\n#### Data Preprocessing:\nThe dataset was cleaned and normalized to ensure that all features were on the same scale. Normalization is crucial in PCA because the algorithm is sensitive to the magnitudes of the variables.\n\n#### PCA Execution:\nPCA was performed on the normalized dataset, generating eight principal components. Each principal component is a linear combination of the original features, and they are orthogonal to each other, meaning they are uncorrelated.\n\n#### Eigenvalues and Scree Plot:\nThe eigenvalues obtained from the PCA were `[1.95, 1.62, 1.11, 1.00, 0.999, 0.885, 0.378, 0.054]`. The scree plot visualizes these eigenvalues, helping to decide the number of principal components to retain. A red horizontal line is drawn at eigenvalue = 1 as a common threshold for selecting significant principal components.\n\n#### Interpretation and Recommendations:\n\n1. **Significant Principal Components**: The first four principal components have eigenvalues greater than 1, suggesting that they capture a significant amount of the total variance in the dataset. \n   \n2. **Variance Captured**: The eigenvalues indicate that the initial principal components capture more variance compared to the latter ones. The sharp drop in eigenvalue magnitude suggests that the first few components are the most informative.\n\n3. **Next Steps**: Based on the eigenvalues and the scree plot, one could consider using only the first four principal components for further analyses, as they are the most informative.\n\n4. **Unusual Scree Plot**: The scree plot showed a curve resembling \\(-x^3\\), which is unusual but not necessarily indicative of an error. It suggests that the principal components' ability to explain the dataset's variance decreases sharply, which warrants further investigation.\n\nThe scree plot and eigenvalues serve as a valuable guide for deciding how many principal components to retain for subsequent analyses. Given the eigenvalues and the scree plot, focusing on the first four principal components seems to be a rational approach.\n\nYou can download the original scree plot [here](sandbox:/mnt/data/Original_Scree_Plot.png)."

                            "Certainly! Here's the summary analysis in Markdown format:\n\n---\n\n```markdown\n### Summary Analysis of PCA Up To the Original Scree Plot\n\n#### Objective:\nThe primary objective of performing Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on the dataset was to reduce the dimensionality while retaining as much information as possible. The dataset contained eight features: 'Lat', 'Lng', 'Age', 'Income', 'VitD_levels', 'Initial_days', 'TotalCharge', and 'Additional_charges'.\n\n#### Data Preprocessing:\nThe dataset was cleaned and normalized to ensure that all features were on the same scale. Normalization is crucial in PCA because the algorithm is sensitive to the magnitudes of the variables.\n\n#### PCA Execution:\nPCA was performed on the normalized dataset, generating eight principal components. Each principal component is a linear combination of the original features, and they are orthogonal to each other, meaning they are uncorrelated.\n\n#### Eigenvalues and Scree Plot:\nThe eigenvalues obtained from the PCA were `[1.95, 1.62, 1.11, 1.00, 0.999, 0.885, 0.378, 0.054]`. The scree plot visualizes these eigenvalues, helping to decide the number of principal components to retain. A red horizontal line is drawn at eigenvalue = 1 as a common threshold for selecting significant principal components.\n\n#### Interpretation and Recommendations:\n\n1. **Significant Principal Components**: The first four principal components have eigenvalues greater than 1, suggesting that they capture a significant amount of the total variance in the dataset. \n   \n2. **Variance Captured**: The eigenvalues indicate that the initial principal components capture more variance compared to the latter ones. The sharp drop in eigenvalue magnitude suggests that the first few components are the most informative.\n\n3. **Next Steps**: Based on the eigenvalues and the scree plot, one could consider using only the first four principal components for further analyses, as they are the most informative.\n\n4. **Unusual Scree Plot**: The scree plot showed a curve resembling \\(-x^3\\), which is unusual but not necessarily indicative of an error. It suggests that the principal components' ability to explain the dataset's variance decreases sharply, which warrants further investigation.\n\nThe scree plot and eigenvalues serve as a valuable guide for deciding how many principal components to retain for subsequent analyses. Given the eigenvalues and the scree plot, focusing on the first four principal components seems to be a rational approach.\n```\n\n---\nYou can copy and paste this Markdown content into your document.

                            "Based on the following, can you wright a summary paragraph on why an organization might benifit from PCA. \n\nPCA Use Cases\nExample 1: Improve Algorithm Runtime\nKNN is a popular machine learning classifier, however its performance can be slow.\nIn the next example, we produced a classification dataset of 1M records with 200 features. Only 5 of them informative.\nKNN ran for ~22 seconds on the full dataset. Running KNN after projecting the data to a 5-dimensional space took only ~1 second! (running on a MacBookPro, 2.3 GHz Intel Core i5, 8GB RAM)\nHere is the code we ran:\n#setup\nimport time\nfrom sklearn import datasets, neighbors\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\n#create dataset\ndata, labels = datasets.make_classification(n_samples=100000, n_features=200, n_informative=5 , n_redundant=195, n_classes=2, random_state=42)\n#project the data\ndata_projected = custom_pca(data, n_components=5)[2]\n#train-test split\nX_train_full, X_test_full, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(data, labels, test_size=0.3, random_state=42)\nX_train_proj, X_test_proj, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(data_projected, labels, test_size=0.3, random_state=42)\n#run classifier on full data\nclf = neighbors.KNeighborsClassifier()\nclf.fit(X_train_full, y_train)\ntic = time.perf_counter()\npredictions = clf.predict(X_test_full)\nruntime_full = time.perf_counter() \u2013 tic\nprint(\u2018full model ran in\u2019, round(runtime_full, 2), \u2018seconds\u2019)\n#run classifier on PCA data\nclf.fit(X_train_proj, y_train)\ntic = time.perf_counter()\npredictions = clf.predict(X_test_proj)\nruntime_proj = time.perf_counter() \u2013 tic\nprint(\u2018PCA model ran in\u2019, round(runtime_proj, 2), \u2018seconds\u2019)\nThe model accuracy remained the same (check it!)\nIn this example, we knew a-priori that the data is \u201creally\u201d 5-dimensional. But plotting the explained variance vector could anyway help us figure out how many PCs we needed.\nExample 2: Improve Classification Accuracy\nThe following article demonstrates an improvement to the accuracy of the tree classifier C4.5 using PCA. Running an experiment on a medical dataset from UCI Machine Learning repository, the authors we able to improve model accuracy from 86% to 91% while precision dramatically improved from 33% to 100%. \n\nIn another article, the authors analysed the performance of six different machine learning classifiers. They were able to get improvement in accuracy while reducing the number of features from over 1000 to just a few principal components.\n\nExample 3: Visualization\nThe famous iris dataset is 4-dimensional. Unfortunately, we cannot visualize data with more than 3 features.\nUsing PCA, we projected the data to a 2-dimensional space:\nThis is very helpful for presenting data to various people in your organization. Moreover, it makes it possible to visualize and inspect clustering and classification algorithms and their performance. \n \npca what how why\nExample 4: Reduce Noise in Data\nTo demonstrate reduction in noise, let\u2019s look at the following example:\n\n\nThe data is mostly spread along the x-axis, while on the y-axis the distribution is dominated more by noise. \nProjecting the data to a 1-dimensional space eliminates that noise.\nUsing PCA to clean noise from data that represents a signal (image, audio) can help achieve a \u201ccleaner\u201d signal.\nExample 5: Feature Selection\nFor feature selection, consider that in the previous example, the first principal component vector is (0.905, 0.423). This means that the projection is a linear combination of the two features with ratio of approximately 2:1. We could use this knowledge in order to perform feature selection. The features we see that get most weight of the projection in the primary principal components are the important features. We could use that fact in order to run models on our original data (without PCA transformation), and by doing so, maintain interpretability of the model.\n\nDrawbacks of PCA (Principal Component Analysis)\nAs with any framework, PCA has its own drawbacks. First, PCA assumes that the relationship between variables are linear. If the data is embedded on a nonlinear manifold, PCA will produce wrong results [5].\n\nPCA is also sensitive to outliers. Such data inputs could produce results that are very much off the correct projection of the data [6].\n\nPCA presents limitations when it comes to interpretability. Since we\u2019re transforming the data, features lose their original meaning. This could be problematic in cases where interpretability of the data is important. However, in the feature selection example we mentioned earlier, there are cases where we can still partially interpret the model. \n\nFinally, PCA is only suitable for continuous, non-discrete data. If some of our features are categorical, PCA is not a good choice [7].\n\nA summary of what is a principal component analysis \nWe hope you\u2019ve benefited from our review of some of the most important concepts needed for using PCA. It\u2019s not complicated to use, but it does require some attention and an understanding of how it works.\n\nBecause of the versatility of PCA, it has been shown to be effective in a wide variety of contexts and disciplines. Given a high dimensional dataset, it\u2019s a good idea to start with PCA in order to understand the main variance in the data and to understand its \u201creal\u201d dimensionality by plotting the explained variance vector. Note that PCA is not useful for every dataset, but it does offer a simple and efficient framework for gaining insight into high-dimensional data.\n\nConclusion\n\nBigabid not only outperforms a results-based DSP for some of the best app developers on the planet, we strive to share our knowledge to help improve the industry with absolute transparency.

                            "Certainly, here's a summary paragraph that encapsulates why an organization might benefit from using Principal Component Analysis (PCA):\n\n---\n\nPrincipal Component Analysis (PCA) serves as a versatile tool for data optimization and simplification across various sectors. Organizations using machine learning algorithms like KNN can significantly reduce computational time without compromising on model accuracy. For example, a KNN model that took 22 seconds to run on a dataset with 200 features was reduced to just 1 second when applied to a 5-dimensional space created through PCA. Notably, the model's accuracy remained consistent. In addition to enhancing computational efficiency, PCA can also improve model accuracy and precision, as evidenced by experiments on medical datasets. For visualization, PCA can project high-dimensional data into a 2D or 3D space, making it more comprehensible and facilitating the evaluation of clustering and classification algorithms. The technique is also effective in noise reduction and feature selection, where it helps in identifying the most impactful variables. However, it's important to note that PCA is most effective with continuous, non-discrete data and assumes linear relationships between variables. Given its ability to quickly provide insightful perspectives on high-dimensional data, PCA stands as a valuable starting point for any data-driven decision-making process in an organization.\n\n---\n\nFeel free to use or modify this summary for your class assignment.

However, \"Why Nations Fail\" by Daron Acemoglu and James A. Robinson is another book that attempts to explain the inequalities among different nations and has received substantial attention within academic circles.\n\n- Focus: \"Why Nations Fail\" emphasizes the role of political and economic institutions in shaping the success or failure of nations, in contrast to geographic or cultural factors.\n  \n- Inclusive vs. Extractive Institutions: The book distinguishes between \"inclusive\" institutions, which allow for economic competition and political participation, and \"extractive\" institutions, which concentrate power and wealth.\n\n- Historical Analysis: It provides a deep historical analysis to support its arguments, examining cases from the Roman Empire to modern China and Russia.\n\nWhile no book is universally accepted, \"Why Nations Fail\" has been praised for its rigorous methodology and is often cited in academic literature on economics and political science."

Extractive institutions concentrate power and resources, stifling economic development.\n\n- Virtuous Cycle: Inclusive institutions create a positive feedback loop where prosperity and innovation reinforce and sustain these institutions.\n\n- Vicious Cycle: Extractive institutions lead to a negative feedback loop where poverty and lack of innovation perpetuate the power of the elites.\n\n- Case Studies: Examines various historical and contemporary cases, such as the divergence between North and South Korea, the failure of the Maya civilization, and the success of Botswana, to support its arguments.\n\n- Long-Term View: Short-term interventions, like foreign aid, often fail to bring sustained improvement because they don\u2019t address institutional underpinnings.\n\n- Political Centralization: A certain level of centralized power is necessary to enforce laws and provide public goods, but this centralization must be balanced by inclusive institutions.\n\n- Resistance to Change: Extractive institutions often resist change because elites have vested interests in maintaining their power.\n\n- Role of History: Past events can have long-lasting impacts on institutions, but change is possible through collective action and reform.\n\n- Critique of Other Theories: Dismisses geographic, cultural, and ignorance hypotheses as insufficient to explain the complex factors leading to the success or failure of nations."

                            "Sure! In simple terms, embeddings in OpenAI models like GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) are a way to convert words or phrases into a list of numbers. These numbers capture the meaning or context of the word in a way that the computer can understand.\n\n1. Where the Numbers Come From: Initially, the model is trained on a large dataset of text. During this training, it learns to associate words with specific patterns of numbers (the embeddings) so that similar words or concepts have similar sets of numbers.\n\n2. The Role of Layers: The model has multiple layers that further refine these embeddings as a sentence progresses, allowing it to understand context, grammar, and even sentiment.\n\n3. Using the Numbers: When you input a sentence, each word gets converted into its numerical form (embedding). The model then uses these numbers to figure out what comes next, either completing a sentence or answering a question.\n\n4. Output: The model turns its final set of numbers back into human-readable words, giving you the generated text.\n\n5. Adaptability: Over time and with more data, the model can fine-tune these embeddings, making them better at understanding and generating text that is contextually and semantically relevant.\n\nSo, embeddings are like a numerical shortcut for the model to understand and manipulate language, helping it generate responses or complete tasks."

Birth: The moment you type the word \"apple,\" it gets converted into a unique list of numbers\u2014its embedding. This is like its \"birth certificate,\" and it's created based on patterns the model learned during its training.\n\n2. Kindergarten: As \"apple\" enters the first layer of the neural network, it meets other word-embeddings from the sentence it belongs to, like \"red\" and \"delicious.\" Here, they all get a little mixed and influenced by each other, refining their numerical values.\n\n3. School Years: Our \"apple\" embedding continues through multiple layers of the model. With each layer, it gathers more context, adjusting its numbers slightly to better reflect its place in the sentence. Maybe it learns that it's part of a fruit salad, or perhaps it's in a tech discussion about Apple Inc.\n\n4. College: By the time it reaches the final layers, our \"apple\" embedding has matured. It has accumulated a rich set of numerical values that encapsulate not just its identity as \"apple,\" but also its context, relationships, and nuances within the sentence it came from.\n\n5. Job Application: Now it's time for the embedding to do its job. It joins other word-embeddings to help the model make a decision. Should it complete a sentence? Answer a question? Its numbers are used to calculate the most appropriate response.\n\n6. Outcome: Based on these calculations, the model decides what words should come next. It then converts another set of numbers back into human-readable words, delivering the final output.\n\n7. Retirement: Once the output is generated, our \"apple\" embedding has fulfilled its purpose. It can rest, knowing it contributed to answering your query or completing your text.\n\nAnd so, the life of the \"apple\" embedding comes to a peaceful end, until the next time it's summoned into existence when someone else types the word \"apple.\""

Today is special; the word \"apple\" is about to be transformed.\n\n#### Initiation Ritual\n\nThe algorithms gather around the word \"apple,\" which is still just letters on a digital parchment. The initiation ritual begins. Algorithms hum in a computational dance, referencing a mystical tome filled with knowledge gathered from countless texts across the internet.\n\n#### First Breath\n\nThe room glows as the word \"apple\" starts vibrating. Then, in an instant, it morphs into a list of numbers\u2014its brand new embedding. These numbers aren't random; they've been carefully chosen based on the wisdom of the algorithms and the patterns they've learned during their training.\n\n#### The Birth Certificate\n\nThe algorithms inscribe these numbers onto a digital birth certificate. This isn't just any list of numbers; it's a unique code that encapsulates everything that \"apple\" represents. It's like a DNA sequence but for data, and it ensures that \"apple\" will interact in meaningful ways with other word-embeddings it will meet later in its journey.\n\n#### Naming Ceremony\n\nFinally, the algorithms give this newborn embedding a name, forever to be known as \"Apple_Embed_7289,\" a unique identifier in a world of data. The algorithms send out a tiny pulse of electricity, a digital cheer, to celebrate another successful transformation.\n\n---\n\nNow, \"Apple_Embed_7289\" is ready to move on to Kindergarten, where it will start the next chapter of its life, mingling and growing with other embeddings."
