                            "The carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) is a protein that is normally produced in very small amounts in the tissues of a developing fetus. After birth, the production of CEA usually stops, and the levels in the blood are very low or undetectable in healthy adults. However, certain types of cancers can cause elevated levels of CEA, including colorectal, pancreatic, stomach, and breast cancers. Elevated CEA levels may also be seen in some non-cancerous conditions, such as liver disease, lung infections, and inflammatory bowel disease.\n\nCEA is often used as a tumor marker, which means it can be measured in the blood to monitor certain types of cancer. It is commonly used to:\n\n1. Monitor the effectiveness of treatment for certain types of cancer.\n2. Check for recurrence of cancer after treatment has been completed.\n3. Sometimes used in conjunction with other tests to aid in the diagnosis of cancer, although it is not highly specific for any particular type of cancer.\n\nIt's important to note that elevated levels of CEA alone are not sufficient to diagnose cancer. Other diagnostic tests, such as imaging studies and biopsies, are usually required for a definitive diagnosis.\n\nWould you like to know more about the latest research papers related to CEA antigen?"

                            "Durvalumab is a monoclonal antibody that is used as an immunotherapy for certain types of cancer. It works by targeting the programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1), a protein that is often overexpressed on the surface of cancer cells. By blocking the interaction between PD-L1 and its receptor, PD-1, durvalumab helps to activate T cells, which can then attack the cancer cells.\n\nDurvalumab is approved for the treatment of several types of cancer, including:\n\n1. Locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma: It is used in patients who have disease progression during or following platinum-containing chemotherapy.\n  \n2. Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC): It is used as a maintenance treatment for patients with locally advanced, unresectable NSCLC whose disease has not progressed following concurrent platinum-based chemotherapy and radiation therapy.\n\nThe drug is usually administered intravenously and can have side effects, including but not limited to fatigue, musculoskeletal pain, decreased appetite, and infusion-related reactions. Like other immunotherapies, durvalumab can also cause immune-related adverse events, such as pneumonitis, hepatitis, colitis, and endocrinopathies.\n\nWould you like to know more about the latest research papers related to durvalumab?"

                            "Statins are a class of drugs commonly used to lower cholesterol levels in the blood. They work by inhibiting the enzyme HMG-CoA reductase, which plays a central role in the production of cholesterol in the liver. Statins are often prescribed to reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases such as heart attacks and strokes.\n\nDementia, on the other hand, is a general term for a decline in cognitive ability severe enough to interfere with daily life. Alzheimer's disease is the most common type of dementia. Dementia is not a specific disease but rather a term that covers a wide range of medical conditions, including Alzheimer's disease.\n\n### Relationship Between Statins and Dementia\n\nThe relationship between statins and dementia has been a subject of research and debate. Some studies suggest that statins may have a protective effect against the onset of dementia, including Alzheimer's disease. The proposed mechanisms for this protective effect include:\n\n1. Improved Blood Flow: Statins can improve blood flow in the brain, which may help in preventing cognitive decline.\n  \n2. Anti-inflammatory Effects: Statins have anti-inflammatory properties that could potentially reduce brain inflammation, a factor that has been implicated in dementia.\n\n3. Lowering Cholesterol: High levels of cholesterol have been linked to the development of dementia. By lowering cholesterol, statins could potentially reduce the risk of dementia.\n\nHowever, other studies have not found a significant benefit of statins in preventing or treating dementia. Some research even suggests that statins could potentially worsen cognitive function, although these findings are not universally accepted.\n\nIt's worth noting that while some observational studies have suggested a link between statin use and reduced risk of dementia, randomized controlled trials have generally not supported this association. Therefore, the evidence is not conclusive, and more research is needed to determine the relationship between statins and dementia.\n\nWould you like to know about the latest research paper on this topic?"

However, see Pub. 971, Innocent Spouse Relief, for an exception that applies to TEFRA partnership proceedings.\nL492: \nL493:                     * You checked \"No\" on line 1.\nL494: \nL495: #### When To File\nL496: \nL497: You should file Form 8857 as soon as you become aware of a tax liability for which you believe only your spouse or former spouse should be held responsible. The following are some of the ways you may become aware of such a liability.\nL498: \nL499:                     * The IRS is examining your tax return and proposing to increase your tax liability.\nL500: \nL501:                     * The IRS sends you a notice.\nL502: \nL503: However, you must generally file Form 8857 no later than 2 years after the first IRS attempt to collect the tax from you. (But see the exceptions below for different filing deadlines that apply.) For this reason, do not delay filing because you do not have all the required documentation.\nL504: \nL505: Collection activities that may start the 2-year period include the following.\nL506: \nL507:                     * The IRS offset your income tax refund against an amount you owed on a joint return for another year and the IRS informed you about your right to file Form 8857.\nL508: \nL509:                     * The filing of a claim by the IRS in a court proceeding in which you were a party or the filing of a claim in a proceeding that involves your property. This includes the filing of a proof of claim in a bankruptcy proceeding.\nL510: \nL511:                     * The filing of a suit by the United States against you to collect the joint liability.\nL512: \nL513:                     * The issuance of a section 6330 notice, which notifies you of the IRS's intent to levy and your right to a collection due process (CDP) hearing. The IRS usually sends a section 6330 notice by issuing a Letter 11 or Letter 1058.\nL514: \nL515: Exception for equitable relief.\nL516: \nL517: The amount of time to request equitable relief depends on whether you are seeking relief from a balance due, seeking a credit or refund, or both.\nL518: \nL519:                     * Balance Due\u2014Generally, you must file your request within the time period the IRS has to collect the tax. Generally, the IRS has 10 years from the date the tax liability was assessed to collect the tax. In certain cases, the 10-year period is suspended. The amount of time the suspension is in effect will extend the time the IRS has to collect the tax. See Pub. 594, The IRS Collection Process, for details.\nL520: \nL521:                     * Credit or Refund\u2014Generally, you must file your request within 3 years after the date the original return was filed or within 2 years after the date the tax was paid, whichever is later. But you may have more time to file if you live in a federally declared disaster area or you are physically or mentally unable to manage your financial affairs. See Pub. 556, Examination of Returns, Appeal Rights, and Claims for Refund, for details.\nL522: \nL523:                     * Both a Balance Due and a Credit or Refund\u2014If you are seeking a refund of amounts you paid and relief from a balance due over and above what you have paid, the time period for credit or refund will apply to any payments you have made, and the time period for collection of a balance due amount will apply to any unpaid liability.\nL524: \nL525: Exception for relief from liability for tax attributable to an item of community income.\nL526: \nL527: If you are requesting relief from liability for tax attributable to an item of community income (other than equitable relief), a different filing deadline applies. See \u301091\u2020Relief from liability for tax attributable to an item of community income\u3011, discussed later under Community Property Laws. The time in which to request equitable relief from liability for tax attributable to an item of community income follows the rules for equitable relief, earlier.\nL528: \nL529: #### Where To File\nL530: \nL531: Do not file Form 8857 with your tax return or the Tax Court. Instead, mail it to one of the following addresses.  \nL532: \nL533: If using the U.S. Postal Service:\nL534: \nL535: Internal Revenue Service  \nL536: P.O.

In your petition, you should raise innocent spouse relief as a defense to the deficiency. By doing so, you preserve your rights if the IRS is unable to properly consider your request before the end of the 90-day period. Include the information that supports your position, including when and why you filed Form 8857 with the IRS, in your petition to the Tax Court. The time for filing with the Tax Court is not extended while the IRS is considering your request.\nL548: \nL549: #### The IRS Must Contact Your Spouse or Former Spouse\nL550: \nL551: By law, the IRS must contact your spouse or former spouse. There are no exceptions, even for victims of spousal abuse or domestic violence.\nL552: \nL553: We will inform your spouse or former spouse that you filed Form 8857 and will allow him or her to participate in the process. If you are requesting relief from joint and several liability on a joint return, the IRS must also inform him or her of its preliminary and final determinations regarding your requested relief.\nL554: \nL555: To protect your privacy, the IRS will not disclose your personal information (such as your current name, address, phone number(s), or information about your employer, your income, or your assets). Any other information you provide that the IRS uses to make a determination about your request for relief from liability could be disclosed to the person you list on line 6.

They are:\nL562: \nL563:                     1. Innocent spouse relief,\nL564: \nL565:                     2. Separation of liability relief,\nL566: \nL567:                     3. Equitable relief, and\nL568: \nL569:                     4. Relief from liability for tax attributable to an item of community income. (See \u301090\u2020 Community Property Laws\u3011, later).\nL570: \nL571: #### Innocent Spouse Relief\nL572: \nL573: You may be allowed innocent spouse relief only if all of the following apply.\nL574: \nL575:                     * You filed a joint return for the year(s) entered on line 3.\nL576: \nL577:                     * There is an understated tax on the return(s) that is due to erroneous items (defined below) of the person with whom you filed the joint return.\nL578: \nL579:                     * You can show that when you signed the return(s) you did not know and had no reason to know that the understated tax existed (or the extent to which the understated tax existed).\nL580: \nL581:                     * Taking into account all the facts and circumstances, it would be unfair to hold you liable for the understated tax.\nL582: \nL583: Understated tax.\nL584: \nL585: You have an understated tax if the IRS determined that your total tax should be more than the amount actually shown on the return.\nL586: \nL587: Example.\nL588: \nL589: You and your former spouse filed a joint return showing $5,000 of tax, which was fully paid. The IRS later examines the return and finds $10,000 of income that your former spouse earned but did not report. With the additional income, the total tax becomes $6,500. The understated tax is $1,500, for which you and your former spouse are both liable.\nL590: \nL591: Erroneous items.\nL592: \nL593: Any income, deduction, credit, or basis is an erroneous item if it is omitted from or incorrectly\nVisible: 41% - 55%",

The following are some of the ways you may become aware of such a liability.\nL498: \nL499:                     * The IRS is examining your tax return and proposing to increase your tax liability.\nL500: \nL501:                     * The IRS sends you a notice.\nL502: \nL503: However, you must generally file Form 8857 no later than 2 years after the first IRS attempt to collect the tax from you. (But see the exceptions below for different filing deadlines that apply.) For this reason, do not delay filing because you do not have all the required documentation.\nL504: \nL505: Collection activities that may start the 2-year period include the following.\nL506: \nL507:                     * The IRS offset your income tax refund against an amount you owed on a joint return for another year and the IRS informed you about your right to file Form 8857.\nL508: \nL509:                     * The filing of a claim by the IRS in a court proceeding in which you were a party or the filing of a claim in a proceeding that involves your property. This includes the filing of a proof of claim in a bankruptcy proceeding.\nL510: \nL511:                     * The filing of a suit by the United States against you to collect the joint liability.\nL512: \nL513:                     * The issuance of a section 6330 notice, which notifies you of the IRS's intent to levy and your right to a collection due process (CDP) hearing. The IRS usually sends a section 6330 notice by issuing a Letter 11 or Letter 1058.\nL514: \nL515: Exception for equitable relief.\nL516: \nL517: The amount of time to request equitable relief depends on whether you are seeking relief from a balance due, seeking a credit or refund, or both.\nL518: \nL519:                     * Balance Due\u2014Generally, you must file your request within the time period the IRS has to collect the tax. Generally, the IRS has 10 years from the date the tax liability was assessed to collect the tax. In certain cases, the 10-year period is suspended. The amount of time the suspension is in effect will extend the time the IRS has to collect the tax. See Pub. 594, The IRS Collection Process, for details.\nL520: \nL521:                     * Credit or Refund\u2014Generally, you must file your request within 3 years after the date the original return was filed or within 2 years after the date the tax was paid, whichever is later. But you may have more time to file if you live in a federally declared disaster area or you are physically or mentally unable to manage your financial affairs. See Pub. 556, Examination of Returns, Appeal Rights, and Claims for Refund, for details.\nL522: \nL523:                     * Both a Balance Due and a Credit or Refund\u2014If you are seeking a refund of amounts you paid and relief from a balance due over and above what you have paid, the time period for credit or refund will apply to any payments you have made, and the time period for collection of a balance due amount will apply to any unpaid liability.\nL524: \nL525: Exception for relief from liability for tax attributable to an item of community income.\nL526: \nL527: If you are requesting relief from liability for tax attributable to an item of community income (other than equitable relief), a different filing deadline applies. See Relief from liability for tax attributable to an item of community income, discussed later under Community Property Laws. The time in which to request equitable relief from liability for tax attributable to an item of community income follows the rules for equitable relief, earlier.\nL528: \nL529: #### Where To File\nL530: \nL531: Do not file Form 8857 with your tax return or the Tax Court. Instead, mail it to one of the following addresses.  \nL532: \nL533: If using the U.S. Postal Service:\nL534: \nL535: Internal Revenue Service  \nL536: P.O. Box 120053  \nL537: Covington, KY 41012 If using a private delivery service: Internal Revenue Service  \nL538: 7940 Kentucky Drive, Stop 840F  \nL539: Florence, KY 41042 Alternatively, you can fax the form and attachments to the IRS at 855-233-8558. \nL540: \nL541: For a list of private delivery services you can use to meet the \"timely mailing as timely filing\" rule for filing Form 8857 by the deadline, go to IRS.gov/PDS.\nL542: \nL543: Write your name and social security number (SSN) on any attachments.\nL544: \nL545: Send it to one of the above addresses or fax it to the above number even if you are communicating with an IRS employee because of an examination, examination appeal, or collection.\nL546: \nL547: If you received an IRS notice of deficiency, you should also file a petition with the Tax Court before the end of the 90-day period, as explained in the notice. In your petition, you should raise innocent spouse relief as a defense to the deficiency. By doing so, you preserve your rights if the IRS is unable to properly consider your request before the end of the 90-day period. Include the information that supports your position, including when and why you filed Form 8857 with the IRS, in your petition to the Tax Court. The time for filing with the Tax Court is not extended while the IRS is considering your request.\nL548: \nL549: #### The IRS Must Contact Your Spouse or Former Spouse\nL550: \nL551: By law, the IRS must contact your spouse or former spouse. There are no exceptions, even for victims of spousal abuse or domestic violence.\nL552: \nL553: We will inform your spouse or former spouse that you filed Form 8857 and will allow him or her to participate in the process. If you are requesting relief from joint and several liability on a joint return, the IRS must also inform him or her of its preliminary and final determinations regarding your requested relief.\nL554: \nL555: To protect your privacy, the IRS will not disclose your personal information (such as your current name, address, phone number(s), or information about your employer, your income, or your assets). Any other information you provide that the IRS uses to make a determination about your request for relief from liability could be disclosed to the person you list on line 6. If you have concerns about your privacy or the privacy of others, you should redact or black out personal information in the material you submit.\nL556: \nL557: .[Image: This is an Image: caution.gif]If you petition the Tax Court (explained later under What Happens After You File Form 8857), your spouse or former spouse may see your personal information, unless you ask the Tax Court to withhold it. .\nL558: \nL559: #### Types of Relief\nL560: \nL561: Four types of relief are available.

Equitable relief, and\nL568: \nL569:                     4. Relief from liability for tax attributable to an item of community income. (See  Community Property Laws, later).\nL570: \nL571: #### Innocent Spouse Relief\nL572: \nL573: You may be allowed innocent spouse relief only if all of the following apply.\nL574: \nL575:                     * You filed a joint return for the year(s) entered on line 3.\nL576: \nL577:                     * There is an understated tax on the return(s) that is due to erroneous items (defined below) of the person with whom you filed the joint return.\nL578: \nL579:                     * You can show that when you signed the return(s) you did not know and had no reason to know that the understated tax existed (or the extent to which the understated tax existed).\nL580: \nL581:                     * Taking into account all the facts and circumstances, it would be unfair to hold you liable for the understated tax.\nL582: \nL583: Understated tax.\nL584: \nL585: You have an understated tax if the IRS determined that your total tax should be more than the amount actually shown on the return.\nL586: \nL587: Example.\nL588: \nL589: You and your former spouse filed a joint return showing $5,000 of tax, which was fully paid.

Box 120053  \nCovington, KY 41012 If using a private delivery service: Internal Revenue Service  \n7940 Kentucky Drive, Stop 840F  \nFlorence, KY 41042 Alternatively, you can fax the form and attachments to the IRS at 855-233-8558. \n\nFor a list of private delivery services you can use to meet the \"timely mailing as timely filing\" rule for filing Form 8857 by the deadline, go to \u3010129\u2020IRS.gov/PDS\u3011.\n\nWrite your name and social security number (SSN) on any attachments.\n\nSend it to one of the above addresses or fax it to the above number even if you are communicating with an IRS employee because of an examination, examination appeal, or collection.\n\nIf you received an IRS notice of deficiency, you should also file a petition with the Tax Court before the end of the 90-day period, as explained in the notice. In your petition, you should raise innocent spouse relief as a defense to the deficiency. By doing so, you preserve your rights if the IRS is unable to properly consider your request before the end of the 90-day period. Include the information that supports your position, including when and why you filed Form 8857 with the IRS, in your petition to the Tax Court. The time for filing with the Tax Court is not extended while the IRS is considering your request.\n\n#### The IRS Must Contact Your Spouse or Former Spouse\n\nBy law, the IRS must contact your spouse or former spouse. There are no exceptions, even for victims of spousal abuse or domestic violence.\n\nWe will inform your spouse or former spouse that you filed Form 8857 and will allow him or her to participate in the process. If you are requesting relief from joint and several liability on a joint return, the IRS must also inform him or her of its preliminary and final determinations regarding your requested relief.\n\nTo protect your privacy, the IRS will not disclose your personal information (such as your current name, address, phone number(s), or information about your employer, your income, or your assets). Any other information you provide that the IRS uses to make a determination about your request for relief from liability could be disclosed to the person you list on line 6. If you have concerns about your privacy or the privacy of others, you should redact or black out personal information in the material you submit.\n\n.[Image: This is an Image: caution.gif]If you petition the Tax Court (explained later under What Happens After You File Form 8857), your spouse or former spouse may see your personal information, unless you ask the Tax Court to withhold it. .\n\n#### Types of Relief\n\nFour types of relief are available. They are:\n\n                    1. Innocent spouse relief,\n\n                    2. Separation of liability relief,\n\n                    3. Equitable relief, and\n\n                    4. Relief from liability for tax attributable to an item of community income. (See \u301090\u2020 Community Property Laws\u3011, later).\n\n#### Innocent Spouse Relief\n\nYou may be allowed innocent spouse relief only if all of the following apply.\n\n                    * You filed a joint return for the year(s) entered on line 3.\n\n                    * There is an understated tax on the return(s) that is due to erroneous items (defined below) of the person with whom you filed the joint return.\n\n                    * You can show that when you signed the return(s) you did not know and had no reason to know that the understated tax existed (or the extent to which the understated tax existed).\n\n                    * Taking into account all the facts and circumstances, it would be unfair to hold you liable for the understated tax.\n\nUnderstated tax.\n\nYou have an understated tax if the IRS determined that your total tax should be more than the amount actually shown on the return.\n\nExample.\n\nYou and your former spouse filed a joint return showing $5,000 of tax, which was fully paid. The IRS later examines the return and finds $10,000 of income that your former spouse earned but did not report. With the additional income, the total tax becomes $6,500. The understated tax is $1,500, for which you and your former spouse are both liable.",

However, see Pub. 971, Innocent Spouse Relief, for an exception that applies to TEFRA partnership proceedings.\nL492: \nL493:                     * You checked \"No\" on line 1.\nL494: \nL495: #### When To File\nL496: \nL497: You should file Form 8857 as soon as you become aware of a tax liability for which you believe only your spouse or former spouse should be held responsible. The following are some of the ways you may become aware of such a liability.\nL498: \nL499:                     * The IRS is examining your tax return and proposing to increase your tax liability.\nL500: \nL501:                     * The IRS sends you a notice.\nL502: \nL503: However, you must generally file Form 8857 no later than 2 years after the first IRS attempt to collect the tax from you. (But see the exceptions below for different filing deadlines that apply.) For this reason, do not delay filing because you do not have all the required documentation.\nL504: \nL505: Collection activities that may start the 2-year period include the following.\nL506: \nL507:                     * The IRS offset your income tax refund against an amount you owed on a joint return for another year and the IRS informed you about your right to file Form 8857.\nL508: \nL509:                     * The filing of a claim by the IRS in a court proceeding in which you were a party or the filing of a claim in a proceeding that involves your property. This includes the filing of a proof of claim in a bankruptcy proceeding.\nL510: \nL511:                     * The filing of a suit by the United States against you to collect the joint liability.\nL512: \nL513:                     * The issuance of a section 6330 notice, which notifies you of the IRS's intent to levy and your right to a collection due process (CDP) hearing. The IRS usually sends a section 6330 notice by issuing a Letter 11 or Letter 1058.\nL514: \nL515: Exception for equitable relief.\nL516: \nL517: The amount of time to request equitable relief depends on whether you are seeking relief from a balance due, seeking a credit or refund, or both.\nL518: \nL519:                     * Balance Due\u2014Generally, you must file your request within the time period the IRS has to collect the tax. Generally, the IRS has 10 years from the date the tax liability was assessed to collect the tax. In certain cases, the 10-year period is suspended. The amount of time the suspension is in effect will extend the time the IRS has to collect the tax. See Pub. 594, The IRS Collection Process, for details.\nL520: \nL521:                     * Credit or Refund\u2014Generally, you must file your request within 3 years after the date the original return was filed or within 2 years after the date the tax was paid, whichever is later. But you may have more time to file if you live in a federally declared disaster area or you are physically or mentally unable to manage your financial affairs. See Pub. 556, Examination of Returns, Appeal Rights, and Claims for Refund, for details.\nL522: \nL523:                     * Both a Balance Due and a Credit or Refund\u2014If you are seeking a refund of amounts you paid and relief from a balance due over and above what you have paid, the time period for credit or refund will apply to any payments you have made, and the time period for collection of a balance due amount will apply to any unpaid liability.\nL524: \nL525: Exception for relief from liability for tax attributable to an item of community income.\nL526: \nL527: If you are requesting relief from liability for tax attributable to an item of community income (other than equitable relief), a different filing deadline applies. See Relief from liability for tax attributable to an item of community income, discussed later under Community Property Laws. The time in which to request equitable relief from liability for tax attributable to an item of community income follows the rules for equitable relief, earlier.\nL528: \nL529: #### Where To File\nL530: \nL531: Do not file Form 8857 with your tax return or the Tax Court.

                        "result": " Form 8857]\nL122: \nL123:   * You filed a joint return with an understatement of tax attributed solely to your spouse\u2019s erroneous item. This item includes income \u2014 credits, property basis, and deductions \u2014 that is received by your spouse but was omitted from or incorrectly reported. \nL124:   * You can establish that at the time you signed the tax return, you had no reason to know or did not know there was an understatement of tax.\nL125:   * When you consider all the facts and additional information, it would be unfair to hold you liable for the understatement of tax. \nL126:   * The taxpayer must apply for this relief within two years of the IRS initiating collection. If you do not ask for this relief within the allotted time or do not qualify for it, you will be liable for the \u301025\u2020understated tax\u2020www.irs.gov\u3011. \nL127: \nL128: The IRS will typically not grant innocent spouse relief in cases of tax underpayment, which is when you owe more taxes than you paid. Simply put, you may also be liable if the joint tax return indicates an amount due and your spouse does not pay the taxes. However, if there is both an understatement and an underpayment of taxes, you may be relieved of both. \nL129: \nL130: ## Joint Filing\nL131: \nL132: In some instances, the IRS may inform a US taxpayer that their estranged spouse failed to fully pay taxes regarding a \u301026\u2020joint filing. \u2020www.irs.gov\u3011Such a taxpayer will be understandably concerned that the IRS may hold them accountable for this tax debt.\nL133: \nL134: Still, tax liability under such circumstances is not automatic. The IRS does in some instances provide taxpayers relief. This includes a type of relief known as \u201cseparation of liability.\u201d Under separation of liability, the \u301027\u2020innocent spouse\u3011 is only accountable for the liability allocated to them by the IRS.\nL135: \nL136: Seeking this relief can prove challenging, however. A spouse may be ineligible for such relief if found to have knowledge of the other spouse\u2019s conduct. Disqualification may also occur if the spouse seeking relief transferred property for the other spouse with the purpose of avoiding paying taxes. (The IRS has various criteria on what would constitute knowledge regarding tax avoidance purposes during such property transference.)\nL137: \nL138: There are also a number of other rules that govern whether one is eligible for such relief. Entitlement for such relief requires a \u301028\u2020legal separation\u3011 or a showing you are no longer married. The IRS also requires you as the spouse seeking relief to not reside in the same household.\nL139: \nL140: ## What You Need to File Form 8857 \nL141: \nL142: To seek innocent spouse, equitable, or \u301029\u2020separation of liability relief\u3011, you need to submit a completed Form 8857 to the IRS. Form 8857 is a Request for Innocent Spouse Relief, and it is used to request \u301030\u2020relief from tax liability\u3011, penalties, and interest when you believe your current or former spouse is responsible for these tax issues. \nL143: \nL144: To File Form 8857 correctly, you need to gather the following information:\nL145: \nL146: [Image: Two Spouses Filing Separate Returns For Form 8857]\nL147: \nL148:   * General information about you and your spouse or ex-spouse \nL149:   * The specific tax years which you are seeking relief for \nL150:   * Your current financial situation \nL151:   * Evidence showing your involvement in tax preparation and household finances \nL152:   * Whether you are a survivor of domestic violence \nL153:   * Any information that can help you show that it would be unfair to hold you liable \nL154:   * Any details showing your \u301031\u2020spouse\u2019s fraud\u3011 or their deceit involving the tax return\nL155: \nL156: The information you provide must help the IRS get a good idea about your overall situation. If you do not provide enough information, the IRS can deny your claim. \nL157: \nL158: ## Form 8857 Instructions:\nL159: \nL160: You need to file Form 8857 as soon as you find out that you are being held liable for taxes you believe should only be your spouse\u2019s. You have two years to file from the time the IRS first tries to collect from you to do so, but there are some exceptions. \nL161: \nL162: To file IRS Form 8857: \nL163: \nL164:   1. Download the complete Innocent Spouse Relief form from \u301032\u2020IRS website\u2020www.irs.gov\u3011. \nL165:   2. Fill out all the specific information required, including current name, address, daytime phone number(s), information about your employer, your assets, and amount of income.\nL166:   3. Attach a statement explaining why you qualify for this type of relief. \nL167:   4. Make sure you write your \u301033\u2020Social Security\u3011 number and name on all the attachments. \nL168:   5. Mail the documents to the appropriate addresses. Do not file Form 8857 with your income tax return or to the Tax Court.\nL169:   6. You must answer Question 30 thoroughly and provide information to help the IRS determine if it would be unfair to hold you liable for the tax debt. Ensure you include any details about your spouse\u2019s fraud involving the tax return and information that made it hard for you to know or learn about the tax understatement. \nL170:   7. Wait for a response. By law, the IRS will have to contact your current or former spouse to let them know you filed the form and allow them to participate in the process. There are no exceptions to this rule, even for victims of domestic violence or spousal abuse. \nL171: \nL172: After you file the documentation and your spouse is contacted, the IRS will send a preliminary determination letter notifying you and your spouse of its decision. If neither of you appeals the decision, the IRS will issue a final determination letter. If either of you appeals to the IRS Office of Appeals, that office will give a final determination letter after reviewing your case. \nL173: \nL174: If you do not receive a final determination from the IRS within six months, you can then ask the U.S. Tax Court to review your case. If you received a final judgment from the IRS, you need to file a petition with the Tax Court within 90 days.\nL175: \nL176: ## IRS Form 8857\u2014 Get the Help you Need\nL177: \nL178: Applications for Innocent Spouse Relief are complicated, tedious, and take anywhere from 12 to 24 months to process. You should not have to tackle these complexities on your own.

Form 8857 is a Request for Innocent Spouse Relief, and it is used to request \u301030\u2020relief from tax liability\u3011, penalties, and interest when you believe your current or former spouse is responsible for these tax issues. \n\nTo File Form 8857 correctly, you need to gather the following information:\n\n[Image: Two Spouses Filing Separate Returns For Form 8857]\n\n  * General information about you and your spouse or ex-spouse \n  * The specific tax years which you are seeking relief for \n  * Your current financial situation \n  * Evidence showing your involvement in tax preparation and household finances \n  * Whether you are a survivor of domestic violence \n  * Any information that can help you show that it would be unfair to hold you liable \n  * Any details showing your \u301031\u2020spouse\u2019s fraud\u3011 or their deceit involving the tax return\n\nThe information you provide must help the IRS get a good idea about your overall situation. If you do not provide enough information, the IRS can deny your claim. \n\n## Form 8857 Instructions:\n\nYou need to file Form 8857 as soon as you find out that you are being held liable for taxes you believe should only be your spouse\u2019s. You have two years to file from the time the IRS first tries to collect from you to do so, but there are some exceptions. \n\nTo file IRS Form 8857: \n\n  1. Download the complete Innocent Spouse Relief form from \u301032\u2020IRS website\u2020www.irs.gov\u3011. \n  2. Fill out all the specific information required, including current name, address, daytime phone number(s), information about your employer, your assets, and amount of income.\n  3. Attach a statement explaining why you qualify for this type of relief. \n  4. Make sure you write your \u301033\u2020Social Security\u3011 number and name on all the attachments. \n  5. Mail the documents to the appropriate addresses. Do not file Form 8857 with your income tax return or to the Tax Court.\n  6. You must answer Question 30 thoroughly and provide information to help the IRS determine if it would be unfair to hold you liable for the tax debt. Ensure you include any details about your spouse\u2019s fraud involving the tax return and information that made it hard for you to know or learn about the tax understatement. \n  7. Wait for a response. By law, the IRS will have to contact your current or former spouse to let them know you filed the form and allow them to participate in the process. There are no exceptions to this rule, even for victims of domestic violence or spousal abuse. \n\nAfter you file the documentation and your spouse is contacted, the IRS will send a preliminary determination letter notifying you and your spouse of its decision. If neither of you appeals the decision, the IRS will issue a final determination letter. If either of you appeals to the IRS Office of Appeals, that office will give a final determination letter after reviewing your case. \n\nIf you do not receive a final determination from the IRS within six months, you can then ask the U.S. Tax Court to review your case. If you received a final judgment from the IRS, you need to file a petition with the Tax Court within 90 days.",

                                    "text": " Form 8857]\nL122: \nL123:   * You filed a joint return with an understatement of tax attributed solely to your spouse\u2019s erroneous item. This item includes income \u2014 credits, property basis, and deductions \u2014 that is received by your spouse but was omitted from or incorrectly reported. \nL124:   * You can establish that at the time you signed the tax return, you had no reason to know or did not know there was an understatement of tax.\nL125:   * When you consider all the facts and additional information, it would be unfair to hold you liable for the understatement of tax. \nL126:   * The taxpayer must apply for this relief within two years of the IRS initiating collection. If you do not ask for this relief within the allotted time or do not qualify for it, you will be liable for the understated tax. \nL127: \nL128: The IRS will typically not grant innocent spouse relief in cases of tax underpayment, which is when you owe more taxes than you paid. Simply put, you may also be liable if the joint tax return indicates an amount due and your spouse does not pay the taxes. However, if there is both an understatement and an underpayment of taxes, you may be relieved of both. \nL129: \nL130: ## Joint Filing\nL131: \nL132: In some instances, the IRS may inform a US taxpayer that their estranged spouse failed to fully pay taxes regarding a joint filing. Such a taxpayer will be understandably concerned that the IRS may hold them accountable for this tax debt.\nL133: \nL134: Still, tax liability under such circumstances is not automatic. The IRS does in some instances provide taxpayers relief. This includes a type of relief known as \u201cseparation of liability.\u201d Under separation of liability, the innocent spouse is only accountable for the liability allocated to them by the IRS.\nL135: \nL136: Seeking this relief can prove challenging, however. A spouse may be ineligible for such relief if found to have knowledge of the other spouse\u2019s conduct. Disqualification may also occur if the spouse seeking relief transferred property for the other spouse with the purpose of avoiding paying taxes. (The IRS has various criteria on what would constitute knowledge regarding tax avoidance purposes during such property transference.)\nL137: \nL138: There are also a number of other rules that govern whether one is eligible for such relief. Entitlement for such relief requires a legal separation or a showing you are no longer married. The IRS also requires you as the spouse seeking relief to not reside in the same household.\nL139: \nL140: ## What You Need to File Form 8857 \nL141: \nL142: To seek innocent spouse, equitable, or separation of liability relief, you need to submit a completed Form 8857 to the IRS. Form 8857 is a Request for Innocent Spouse Relief, and it is used to request relief from tax liability, penalties, and interest when you believe your current or former spouse is responsible for these tax issues. \nL143: \nL144: To File Form 8857 correctly, you need to gather the following information:\nL145: \nL146: [Image: Two Spouses Filing Separate Returns For Form 8857]\nL147: \nL148:   * General information about you and your spouse or ex-spouse \nL149:   * The specific tax years which you are seeking relief for \nL150:   * Your current financial situation \nL151:   * Evidence showing your involvement in tax preparation and household finances \nL152:   * Whether you are a survivor of domestic violence \nL153:   * Any information that can help you show that it would be unfair to hold you liable \nL154:   * Any details showing your spouse\u2019s fraud or their deceit involving the tax return\nL155: \nL156: The information you provide must help the IRS get a good idea about your overall situation.

                                    "text": "#### When To File\n\nYou should file Form 8857 as soon as you become aware of a tax liability for which you believe only your spouse or former spouse should be held responsible. The following are some of the ways you may become aware of such a liability.\n\n                    * The IRS is examining your tax return and proposing to increase your tax liability.\n\n                    * The IRS sends you a notice.\n\nHowever, you must generally file Form 8857 no later than 2 years after the first IRS attempt to collect the tax from you. (But see the exceptions below for different filing deadlines that apply.) For this reason, do not delay filing because you do not have all the required documentation.\n\nCollection activities that may start the 2-year period include the following.\n\n                    * The IRS offset your income tax refund against an amount you owed on a joint return for another year and the IRS informed you about your right to file Form 8857.\n\n                    * The filing of a claim by the IRS in a court proceeding in which you were a party or the filing of a claim in a proceeding that involves your property. This includes the filing of a proof of claim in a bankruptcy proceeding.\n\n                    * The filing of a suit by the United States against you to collect the joint liability.\n\n                    * The issuance of a section 6330 notice, which notifies you of the IRS's intent to levy and your right to a collection due process (CDP) hearing. The IRS usually sends a section 6330 notice by issuing a Letter 11 or Letter 1058.\n\nException for equitable relief.\n\nThe amount of time to request equitable relief depends on whether you are seeking relief from a balance due, seeking a credit or refund, or both.\n\n                    * Balance Due\u2014Generally, you must file your request within the time period the IRS has to collect the tax. Generally, the IRS has 10 years from the date the tax liability was assessed to collect the tax. In certain cases, the 10-year period is suspended. The amount of time the suspension is in effect will extend the time the IRS has to collect the tax. See Pub. 594, The IRS Collection Process, for details.\n\n                    * Credit or Refund\u2014Generally, you must file your request within 3 years after the date the original return was filed or within 2 years after the date the tax was paid, whichever is later. But you may have more time to file if you live in a federally declared disaster area or you are physically or mentally unable to manage your financial affairs. See Pub. 556, Examination of Returns, Appeal Rights, and Claims for Refund, for details.\n\n                    * Both a Balance Due and a Credit or Refund\u2014If you are seeking a refund of amounts you paid and relief from a balance due over and above what you have paid, the time period for credit or refund will apply to any payments you have made, and the time period for collection of a balance due amount will apply to any unpaid liability.\n\nException for relief from liability for tax attributable to an item of community income.\n\nIf you are requesting relief from liability for tax attributable to an item of community income (other than equitable relief), a different filing deadline applies. See \u301091\u2020Relief from liability for tax attributable to an item of community income\u3011, discussed later under Community Property Laws. The time in which to request equitable relief from liability for tax attributable to an item of community income follows the rules for equitable relief, earlier.\n\n#### Where To File\n\nDo not file Form 8857 with your tax return or the Tax Court. Instead, mail it to one of the following addresses.  \n\nIf using the U.S. Postal Service:\n\nInternal Revenue Service  \nP.O. Box 120053  \nCovington, KY 41012 If using a private delivery service: Internal Revenue Service  \n7940 Kentucky Drive, Stop 840F  \nFlorence, KY 41042 Alternatively, you can fax the form and attachments to the IRS at 855-233-8558. \n\nFor a list of private delivery services you can use to meet the \"timely mailing as timely filing\" rule for filing Form 8857 by the deadline, go to \u3010129\u2020IRS.gov/PDS\u3011.\n\nWrite your name and social security number (SSN) on any attachments.\n\nSend it to one of the above addresses or fax it to the above number even if you are communicating with an IRS employee because of an examination, examination appeal, or collection.\n\nIf you received an IRS notice of deficiency, you should also file a petition with the Tax Court before the end of the 90-day period, as explained in the notice. In your petition, you should raise innocent spouse relief as a defense to the deficiency. By doing so, you preserve your rights if the IRS is unable to properly consider your request before the end of the 90-day period. Include the information that supports your position, including when and why you filed Form 8857 with the IRS, in your petition to the Tax Court. The time for filing with the Tax Court is not extended while the IRS is considering your request.\n\n#### The IRS Must Contact Your Spouse or Former Spouse\n\nBy law, the IRS must contact your spouse or former spouse. There are no exceptions, even for victims of spousal abuse or domestic violence.\n\nWe will inform your spouse or former spouse that you filed Form 8857 and will allow him or her to participate in the process. If you are requesting relief from joint and several liability on a joint return, the IRS must also inform him or her of its preliminary and final determinations regarding your requested relief.\n\nTo protect your privacy, the IRS will not disclose your personal information (such as your current name, address, phone number(s), or information about your employer, your income, or your assets). Any other information you provide that the IRS uses to make a determination about your request for relief from liability could be disclosed to the person you list on line 6. If you have concerns about your privacy or the privacy of others, you should redact or black out personal information in the material you submit.\n\n.[Image: This is an Image: caution.gif]If you petition the Tax Court (explained later under What Happens After You File Form 8857), your spouse or former spouse may see your personal information, unless you ask the Tax Court to withhold it. .\n\n#### Types of Relief\n\nFour types of relief are available. They are:\n\n                    1. Innocent spouse relief,\n\n                    2. Separation of liability relief,\n\n                    3. Equitable relief, and\n\n                    4. Relief from liability for tax attributable to an item of community income. (See \u301090\u2020 Community Property Laws\u3011, later).\n\n#### Innocent Spouse Relief\n\nYou may be allowed innocent spouse relief only if all of the following apply.\n\n                    * You filed a joint return for the year(s) entered on line 3.\n\n                    * There is an understated tax on the return(s) that is due to erroneous items (defined below) of the person with whom you filed the joint return.\n\n                    * You can show that when you signed the return(s) you did not know and had no reason to know that the understated tax existed (or the extent to which the understated tax existed).\n\n                    * Taking into account all the facts and circumstances, it would be unfair to hold you liable for the understated tax.\n\nUnderstated tax.\n\nYou have an understated tax if the IRS determined that your total tax should be more than the amount actually shown on the return.\n\nExample.\n\nYou and your former spouse filed a joint return showing $5,000 of tax, which was fully paid. The IRS later examines the return and finds $10,000 of income that your former spouse earned but did not report. With the additional income, the total tax becomes $6,500. The understated tax is $1,500, for which you and your former spouse are both liable.",

Form 8857 is a Request for Innocent Spouse Relief, and it is used to request \u301030\u2020relief from tax liability\u3011, penalties, and interest when you believe your current or former spouse is responsible for these tax issues. \n\nTo File Form 8857 correctly, you need to gather the following information:\n\n[Image: Two Spouses Filing Separate Returns For Form 8857]\n\n  * General information about you and your spouse or ex-spouse \n  * The specific tax years which you are seeking relief for \n  * Your current financial situation \n  * Evidence showing your involvement in tax preparation and household finances \n  * Whether you are a survivor of domestic violence \n  * Any information that can help you show that it would be unfair to hold you liable \n  * Any details showing your \u301031\u2020spouse\u2019s fraud\u3011 or their deceit involving the tax return\n\nThe information you provide must help the IRS get a good idea about your overall situation. If you do not provide enough information, the IRS can deny your claim. \n\n## Form 8857 Instructions:\n\nYou need to file Form 8857 as soon as you find out that you are being held liable for taxes you believe should only be your spouse\u2019s. You have two years to file from the time the IRS first tries to collect from you to do so, but there are some exceptions. \n\nTo file IRS Form 8857: \n\n  1. Download the complete Innocent Spouse Relief form from \u301032\u2020IRS website\u2020www.irs.gov\u3011. \n  2. Fill out all the specific information required, including current name, address, daytime phone number(s), information about your employer, your assets, and amount of income.\n  3. Attach a statement explaining why you qualify for this type of relief. \n  4. Make sure you write your \u301033\u2020Social Security\u3011 number and name on all the attachments. \n  5. Mail the documents to the appropriate addresses. Do not file Form 8857 with your income tax return or to the Tax Court.\n  6. You must answer Question 30 thoroughly and provide information to help the IRS determine if it would be unfair to hold you liable for the tax debt. Ensure you include any details about your spouse\u2019s fraud involving the tax return and information that made it hard for you to know or learn about the tax understatement. \n  7. Wait for a response. By law, the IRS will have to contact your current or former spouse to let them know you filed the form and allow them to participate in the process. There are no exceptions to this rule, even for victims of domestic violence or spousal abuse. \n\nAfter you file the documentation and your spouse is contacted, the IRS will send a preliminary determination letter notifying you and your spouse of its decision. If neither of you appeals the decision, the IRS will issue a final determination letter. If either of you appeals to the IRS Office of Appeals, that office will give a final determination letter after reviewing your case. \n\nIf you do not receive a final determination from the IRS within six months, you can then ask the U.S. Tax Court to review your case. If you received a final judgment from the IRS, you need to file a petition with the Tax Court within 90 days.",

Attach a statement explaining why you qualify for this type of relief. \n  4. Make sure you write your \u301033\u2020Social Security\u3011 number and name on all the attachments. \n  5. Mail the documents to the appropriate addresses. Do not file Form 8857 with your income tax return or to the Tax Court.\n  6. You must answer Question 30 thoroughly and provide information to help the IRS determine if it would be unfair to hold you liable for the tax debt. Ensure you include any details about your spouse\u2019s fraud involving the tax return and information that made it hard for you to know or learn about the tax understatement. \n  7. Wait for a response. By law, the IRS will have to contact your current or former spouse to let them know you filed the form and allow them to participate in the process. There are no exceptions to this rule, even for victims of domestic violence or spousal abuse. \n\nAfter you file the documentation and your spouse is contacted, the IRS will send a preliminary determination letter notifying you and your spouse of its decision. If neither of you appeals the decision, the IRS will issue a final determination letter. If either of you appeals to the IRS Office of Appeals, that office will give a final determination letter after reviewing your case. \n\nIf you do not receive a final determination from the IRS within six months, you can then ask the U.S. Tax Court to review your case. If you received a final judgment from the IRS, you need to file a petition with the Tax Court within 90 days.",

                                    "text": "#### When To File\n\nYou should file Form 8857 as soon as you become aware of a tax liability for which you believe only your spouse or former spouse should be held responsible. The following are some of the ways you may become aware of such a liability.\n\n                    * The IRS is examining your tax return and proposing to increase your tax liability.\n\n                    * The IRS sends you a notice.\n\nHowever, you must generally file Form 8857 no later than 2 years after the first IRS attempt to collect the tax from you. (But see the exceptions below for different filing deadlines that apply.) For this reason, do not delay filing because you do not have all the required documentation.\n\nCollection activities that may start the 2-year period include the following.\n\n                    * The IRS offset your income tax refund against an amount you owed on a joint return for another year and the IRS informed you about your right to file Form 8857.\n\n                    * The filing of a claim by the IRS in a court proceeding in which you were a party or the filing of a claim in a proceeding that involves your property. This includes the filing of a proof of claim in a bankruptcy proceeding.\n\n                    * The filing of a suit by the United States against you to collect the joint liability.\n\n                    * The issuance of a section 6330 notice, which notifies you of the IRS's intent to levy and your right to a collection due process (CDP) hearing. The IRS usually sends a section 6330 notice by issuing a Letter 11 or Letter 1058.\n\nException for equitable relief.\n\nThe amount of time to request equitable relief depends on whether you are seeking relief from a balance due, seeking a credit or refund, or both.\n\n                    * Balance Due\u2014Generally, you must file your request within the time period the IRS has to collect the tax. Generally, the IRS has 10 years from the date the tax liability was assessed to collect the tax. In certain cases, the 10-year period is suspended. The amount of time the suspension is in effect will extend the time the IRS has to collect the tax. See Pub. 594, The IRS Collection Process, for details.\n\n                    * Credit or Refund\u2014Generally, you must file your request within 3 years after the date the original return was filed or within 2 years after the date the tax was paid, whichever is later. But you may have more time to file if you live in a federally declared disaster area or you are physically or mentally unable to manage your financial affairs. See Pub. 556, Examination of Returns, Appeal Rights, and Claims for Refund, for details.\n\n                    * Both a Balance Due and a Credit or Refund\u2014If you are seeking a refund of amounts you paid and relief from a balance due over and above what you have paid, the time period for credit or refund will apply to any payments you have made, and the time period for collection of a balance due amount will apply to any unpaid liability.\n\nException for relief from liability for tax attributable to an item of community income.\n\nIf you are requesting relief from liability for tax attributable to an item of community income (other than equitable relief), a different filing deadline applies. See \u301091\u2020Relief from liability for tax attributable to an item of community income\u3011, discussed later under Community Property Laws. The time in which to request equitable relief from liability for tax attributable to an item of community income follows the rules for equitable relief, earlier.\n\n#### Where To File\n\nDo not file Form 8857 with your tax return or the Tax Court. Instead, mail it to one of the following addresses.  \n\nIf using the U.S. Postal Service:\n\nInternal Revenue Service  \nP.O. Box 120053  \nCovington, KY 41012 If using a private delivery service: Internal Revenue Service  \n7940 Kentucky Drive, Stop 840F  \nFlorence, KY 41042 Alternatively, you can fax the form and attachments to the IRS at 855-233-8558. \n\nFor a list of private delivery services you can use to meet the \"timely mailing as timely filing\" rule for filing Form 8857 by the deadline, go to \u3010129\u2020IRS.gov/PDS\u3011.\n\nWrite your name and social security number (SSN) on any attachments.\n\nSend it to one of the above addresses or fax it to the above number even if you are communicating with an IRS employee because of an examination, examination appeal, or collection.\n\nIf you received an IRS notice of deficiency, you should also file a petition with the Tax Court before the end of the 90-day period, as explained in the notice. In your petition, you should raise innocent spouse relief as a defense to the deficiency. By doing so, you preserve your rights if the IRS is unable to properly consider your request before the end of the 90-day period. Include the information that supports your position, including when and why you filed Form 8857 with the IRS, in your petition to the Tax Court. The time for filing with the Tax Court is not extended while the IRS is considering your request.\n\n#### The IRS Must Contact Your Spouse or Former Spouse\n\nBy law, the IRS must contact your spouse or former spouse. There are no exceptions, even for victims of spousal abuse or domestic violence.\n\nWe will inform your spouse or former spouse that you filed Form 8857 and will allow him or her to participate in the process. If you are requesting relief from joint and several liability on a joint return, the IRS must also inform him or her of its preliminary and final determinations regarding your requested relief.\n\nTo protect your privacy, the IRS will not disclose your personal information (such as your current name, address, phone number(s), or information about your employer, your income, or your assets). Any other information you provide that the IRS uses to make a determination about your request for relief from liability could be disclosed to the person you list on line 6. If you have concerns about your privacy or the privacy of others, you should redact or black out personal information in the material you submit.\n\n.[Image: This is an Image: caution.gif]If you petition the Tax Court (explained later under What Happens After You File Form 8857), your spouse or former spouse may see your personal information, unless you ask the Tax Court to withhold it. .\n\n#### Types of Relief\n\nFour types of relief are available. They are:\n\n                    1. Innocent spouse relief,\n\n                    2. Separation of liability relief,\n\n                    3. Equitable relief, and\n\n                    4. Relief from liability for tax attributable to an item of community income. (See \u301090\u2020 Community Property Laws\u3011, later).\n\n#### Innocent Spouse Relief\n\nYou may be allowed innocent spouse relief only if all of the following apply.\n\n                    * You filed a joint return for the year(s) entered on line 3.\n\n                    * There is an understated tax on the return(s) that is due to erroneous items (defined below) of the person with whom you filed the joint return.\n\n                    * You can show that when you signed the return(s) you did not know and had no reason to know that the understated tax existed (or the extent to which the understated tax existed).\n\n                    * Taking into account all the facts and circumstances, it would be unfair to hold you liable for the understated tax.\n\nUnderstated tax.\n\nYou have an understated tax if the IRS determined that your total tax should be more than the amount actually shown on the return.\n\nExample.\n\nYou and your former spouse filed a joint return showing $5,000 of tax, which was fully paid. The IRS later examines the return and finds $10,000 of income that your former spouse earned but did not report. With the additional income, the total tax becomes $6,500. The understated tax is $1,500, for which you and your former spouse are both liable.",

                            "Creating a compelling narrative for IRS Form 8857 when you have a lot of details to include can be challenging due to space constraints. Here are some tips to help you focus your narrative:\n\n1. **Prioritize Key Points**: Choose the most critical events, facts, or circumstances that are directly relevant to your request for innocent spouse relief. \n\n2. **Be Chronological**: Try to present events in chronological order for better clarity and understanding.\n\n3. **Be Clear and Concise**: Use clear, straightforward language. Avoid jargon or overly complex sentences.\n\n4. **Focus on Causality**: Make clear connections between events and how they led to the tax issue. Show why you believe you should qualify for relief.\n\n5. **Include Important Dates**: Specify dates to help establish the timeline of events. This could add credibility to your narrative.\n\n6. **Highlight Evidence**: Refer to the documents or evidence you're including to support your claim. Make it clear how each piece of evidence supports your narrative.\n\n7. **Keep It Relevant**: Stick to the points directly related to the tax liability issue. Avoid off-topic anecdotes or details.\n\n8. **Edit and Revise**: Once you've written your initial draft, go back and edit for clarity, conciseness, and impact.\n\n9. **Use Attachments**: If the form doesn't offer enough space, consider attaching a separate sheet where you can elaborate on your situation. Make sure to label it clearly and refer to it in the main form.\n\n10. **Test Read**: Have someone else read your narrative to see if it's easy to understand and compelling. A fresh pair of eyes can offer valuable perspective.\n\n11. **Stay Focused on Criteria**: Each type of relief has its own criteria. Make sure your narrative directly addresses the criteria for the type of relief you are seeking.\n\n12. **Consult a Professional**: Due to the form's importance, consider having a tax expert review your narrative to ensure it effectively makes your case.\n\nCrafting a well-focused narrative can significantly improve the chances that your request for relief will be granted."

                            "Okay, I'm not sure where to start, but I'll start from my first awareness of the problem. I had no idea there was any issues with IRS. I assumed John was doing taxes diligently. When I approached him about getting help, if he was frustrated with them, I would tell him to go to a tax place where I'll pay. I will pay. You know he's so stubborn. And he gets pissed at me for interfering and doubting him, so I had to step back with taxes. That's where part of the abuse was. I remember that. I know. So, that being said... I thought it was because he was such a tax professional. I thought he was, too. He knew what he was doing. I trusted him. So, well, we moved here. You know, of course, he didn't pay the mortgage. He was lying about this, lying about that. But anyways, we move out here. I told him I take the paycheck every week. I handle the money. Okay, okay, okay. He was all like, let me, you know, just come out. So, I was out here taking care of Grampy. After Grampy passed, I was going through paperwork, and I look, and I find a bill from IRS for $18,000. And I go into Sean, and I said, what the freak is this? He had hidden it under a drawer or something. The bill? Stupid place. Yeah! He thinks if he hides it, he doesn't have to deal with it. So, $18,000. So, I approached him on it, and he goes, it's a mistake. There's no way. What the hell is this? Oh, they need to hear. That's, um... Oh, go look. Go look. Yeah. Oh, shit. You need a flashlight? Yeah, want to come with me? I'll come with you.\n\n\n\nThe above is the start of a narrative my mother and I are discussing. Please just document it as we talk"

                            "Through paperwork, and I don't know, I found it hidden under a drawer or under a box, or it was completely hidden, and I pulled it out. I mentioned it to Sean. Sean said, it's a mistake. I don't know. I have no clue what it's about. He said, I really think it's a mistake. And I said, well, we can't just sit here. We got to figure it out. So that's when I started research. I talked to you. I took my money. Did I, any money that I had? Yeah. Yeah. We moved all that stuff. Okay. That's when that happened. Yes. I forget how long ago that was. Yeah. I'm still dealing with that company. But, so anyway, I have, I found it and I saw it, and then I completely was like devastated. So I called Community Tax, I chose, and I started making plans with them. Yeah. And I got bullshitted by Sean all through the process. He, he said, oh, I called. They just want information from work. They want them, Jill. It was something he had to wait for. Yeah. Jill wanted, Jill wanted to, Jill's going to send them all my, they want my money. They want to know what I make. They want my payroll thing. They want information for my job. So Jill's going to do, to get that for me. And I'm like, well, well, Jill's actually going to bring it here. Yeah. Time goes on. I'm like, did Jill send that? No, not yet. Well, you gotta call her. I called her. She's not returning the phone call. She's just busy. She's busy, blah, blah, blah. Months went by, a couple of months went by. I finally pulled them aside. I called Brian. That's bullshit. Nobody asked him to get his payroll. He didn't ask Jill to do that bullshit. No way. You didn't tell me about that part. I know. I haven't gone into total detail. Yeah, no, I know. This is hard because I don't want to, you know, totally frustrate you. So yeah, he told me he was doing that. And finally he had to admit that, oh no, it wasn't. It was a lie. The whole thing was a lie. A facade. And now two or three months have gone by. Thank you very much. So then I called Brian. I called Brian. That's interest. Honey, it's terrible. He just feels that he can hide something and it'll go fucking away. So then I think I've got to lean on my bank account in West Springfield where my social security goes. They take everything except for what social security puts in that account. So the only thing that goes in there and stays in there is social security because that's a law. They can't touch that, but they have leaned it. They've taken money out of that account. I've paid this and that. They've taken money here because he doesn't have a freaking account with any money in it. They just put a lien on whoever. So they think I'm involved and I have no clue. He, oh my fucking God. Okay. Holy shit. Holy shit. They're after him like fucking. So I'm telling Brian. So then time's gone on and he's trying to, I need the taxes for 2000 such and such. So I get Sean to get it. He gives it to me. I go to think we go to actually, he go with me to office Depot and we fax. We don't have a fax machine. So we do that. We're trying to get the information. They've done a few years for us. Then one day I left, I was visiting you. I came home and you got my wheels turning and just opening up to you. I got my wheels turning. I'm like to have all $18,000 in one year in tax to make a fucking hell of a lot of money. Where was that money? So I called Brian right away. I said, Brian, can you go back 2014 and tell me what? I said, I don't know where this money came up. I never saw this money. What the fuck? He goes, okay. And he goes back and goes, it was some kind of a pension or a roll over $78,000, but they took 13,000 in taxes out right away, which is normal. Yeah. Then you still got to claim the rest of your income and they're going to tax you more. That's just life. That's how it goes. Well, Sean, I don't know where the money was. I was, he didn't use it to live. I have fucking no idea. I am like, I've been dragged through the mud with this whole fucking thing. And you know what? Now he's got freaking cancer and that puts another twist in things. I mean, shit. I don't want to tell them he's got cancer because he's got to take responsibility. I want them to think he's got a long life. He's 63. He can pay the shit back. Not me. He's got a job. That's what I'm telling Brian. He's got a job. So Brian knows you're in this situation. Did he say you should go to the police? No, he has just been trying to keep up with me. So finally one day after I heard that from Brian, which is like three months, four months ago, um, Brian told me about that money. And of course I pushed Sean on it and he gave me bullshit about it. But then he finally admitted it. And that was it. I don't want to talk about it. And he walked away and that's been it. We haven't talked about it since. My husband hasn't talked to me about it since. I've been taking care of it. I talk to Brian every other freaking day. So I call Brian and said, look at Brian. I am opening Pandora's box here. Now I can't find seven and now 17 and 2018 taxes. Sean says, maybe I didn't do them. I am in trouble. I am going to end up in freaking jail. And I had no idea about this. I just looked up on computer doing research and I found out that there is such a thing as innocent spouse. He goes, yeah, he goes, yeah. And I said, what do you think? He goes, yeah, I think you should. So he got the forms. He goes, I'm going to, um, fax you the forms or text you the forms on the phone. I get it. And then I printed it and surely I printed these myself. I was so proud of myself and Shirley's printer. Is that to me? This is 8857. So he said to me, if you have problems filling it out, let me know. And which I did. I faxed him what I had done. This is where we are. This is where we are. So the fact that you told Brian legally is at least like you already kind of technically started the process. Sure. Like if we have to. Brian knows. Yeah. So if you want to put the light on, you want to read what I wrote because it's really miscombobulated. Let's take a break. Okay. Good."

Despite Sean initially dismissing it as a mistake, she took matters into her own hands by contacting a company called Community Tax to rectify the situation. As she tried to resolve the tax issues, she found out that Sean had been lying about providing necessary documents to move the process along. Furthermore, her accounts have been leaned, and she is worried about potential legal consequences. Recently, she learned about an $18,000 liability linked to a $78,000 pension or rollover that Sean had, which she had no prior knowledge of. This revelation has added stress and complexity to an already difficult situation. She's in frequent contact with a person named Brian to navigate these problems and has also discovered the concept of \"innocent spouse\" which she is exploring as a potential way out of this predicament. On top of these financial and legal issues, Sean has been diagnosed with cancer, adding another layer of complexity to the situation."

I found recently, because once I found that, I was like, what the hell else? So I'm looking through all the paperwork, I've gone through everything, and I find a bill for $11,000 in taxes for the state of Massachusetts that way. They're the ones that put the lien on this account, the other account that counted. That's in addition to the federal taxes? Yes, that's state taxes. That's going to be a separate process. Well, I faxed it to Brian. He's probably fucking overwhelmed. And you know, the guy probably feels bad for me and probably knows he can't fucking help me. This has been going on for two years. So this is my only option, my only way out. Well, you have to get that, or he can go confess to the IRS right now. Tomorrow he's writing a letter. He's writing a letter. I mean, this is a lot of fuck. For me to have to go through this is torturous. And where the heck was the $78,000? You know what else? When he went to get his Social Security, he doesn't get all his Social Security. When you take your pension early, they deduct that from your Social Security. So instead of getting whatever he's been working his whole life, his put tax, he's only going to get a little bit more than what I get, who worked under bartending and stupid jobs here and there. So he's getting probably... He's really fucked. Everything. So now he's not going to... And that killed me because I'm thinking up the road if something happens to him, I will get some serious money.

Brian, who is assisting with the federal tax issue, is also aware of this state tax situation, but the overall complexity and length of time you've been dealing with these issues have been draining and emotionally taxing for you. Sean's decision to take his pension early has led to a decrease in his Social Security benefits, which has repercussions for your own financial stability in the future.

I mean, that was a horrible time for me, and I just plugged through, and it was me against them. I can't tell you how many times I moved out of that house. I went to a hotel. I hated both of them, but I was the bad guy. Yes, you're right. I wasn't perfect about it, but I was the final one to finally kick Tyler out of the house. But see, like, look what you had to work. Now that I think about it. I had no support. So that whole incident where I was just blown away by the fact that that that Sean just fucking cried me about Tyler, and like I'm never letting him do this, and then like an hour later just gave him the fucking keys and let him go buy drugs. Do you know he went up to the for the summer and spent it with Walter? Walter was strict with him, got him like off of it. He was off of it for the whole summer, and then he came home, and then he was going, I forget what he was going to do, continue rehab or something, and he came home from there. I had to go someplace for the day, and I forget where it was. I come home, and the car is there, and Tyler gets out of the car. Sean has picked him up at the hospital. He OD'd. Sean gave him the keys to the car the day he came home from Maine. No fucking way. And Tyler OD'd. Nikita was with him, and he pumped his heart until they came. Tyler? Nikita kept him alive. Tyler was that OD'd? Yes. I never knew that. He died. I never knew that. He came back. But Sean let him have keys to the car. Just like people thinking 30 days in a rehab is going to cure somebody. That was, Mike, that was a hard time for me. I fucking bet. Like it was hard for me, that whole thing. Even when you left, you left. No, I know, I know, but I'm saying how hard that was. It must have been. I know me being there was difficult, but it was exacerbated by the, like I went away and came back, and it was just utter dysfunction, and it just seemed like it was revolving around fucking Sean. You felt that way? Oh my god. I was so devastated. It was driving me, mom, it drove me, it almost fucking drove me insane watching what was going on in there. I spent my spare time finding needles, finding packets, and when Sean comes home from work, I'm saying he is still using, he is still using. Oh, he said he wasn't. This is what I found. This is still there. It's still going on. This is what I went on through and argued with him, and yeah, we weren't on the same, but anyways, that's another thing. There's a whole other thing, because I got to tell you, mom, that was one of the most, that was a traumatic thing, as traumatic as anything else has been, was that whole experience with Sean. Yeah, yeah, and it was such a shock to me, and I think it contributed to me being not good at that time, and like, I'm sure, but it was, I just, it was so clear to me, and I couldn't say anything, and I just, I always thought of Sean as like this nice guy, this nice guy who had to shit together and do all that stuff, and like, he had me fooled. Yeah, he does. He bullshits everybody. Um, let's get back on topic about this.\n\n\nThe above is side conversation about Sean and not relevant to tax situation. I want to document it anyway. Now we're going to continue to talk about the tax situation, which is the primary focus of this. "

Your husband Sean has not been honest with you about these matters, misleading you multiple times throughout the process. He indicated that the paperwork was a mistake and told you that he was taking steps to resolve the issue, but you later found out that this was not true. This has led to significant stress and financial hardship, including liens on your bank accounts. \n\nYour husband also appears to have mismanaged a pension rollover amounting to $78,000, which has led to a tax liability of $18,000 for one year alone. You had no prior knowledge of this income or the associated tax obligation. In addition, there are missing tax filings for the years 2017 and 2018, which you also were not aware of. Sean's actions have put you in a precarious legal situation, and you are concerned about potential repercussions. \n\nGiven that you had no knowledge of these tax obligations or financial activities, you've consulted with Brian from Community Tax to seek advice and have initiated the process of filing Form 8857 for Innocent Spouse Relief. This form aims to protect you from tax liability for something you had no part in and no knowledge of. Throughout the process, you have been diligent about communicating with Brian, even as your husband continues to be uncooperative and dishonest.\n\nThis narrative can be used as a basis to fill out Form 8857, in which you'll need to elaborate on these points and provide supporting documentation where possible. It should help in establishing that you qualify for Innocent Spouse Relief because you had no knowledge or reason to know of the understatements of tax."

                            "```I, Barbara Kelly, am reaching out for assistance. I have been living with my husband, Sean Kelly, for 32 years. I chose to believe and trust him. Yes, there were red flags, but I found out if I say anything about my thoughts and those red flags, he would get angry, gaslight me, and completely confuse me. So, I ignored these instincts and had to trust him. I arrest taxes. I never questioned, as he is a smart man and knew in my heart he would do the right thing. I could never get involved in tax preparation. I also questioned his honesty, but if I questioned him at all, I would get nowhere and he would lie about his lies. I was so confused, so I chose to let it go. I learned to put up and shut up. In time, a wall was built between us. My trust was abused. We have grown apart for the last 10 years, the last 3 years being the worst. He is always needing money from me. He has borrowed from my family members without telling me, also stole stuff and borrowed from my children's friends and never paid them back. He stopped paying the mortgage unbeknownst to me. I lost all my investments into our home because he lost the house to foreclosure. After losing the home, we came to Colorado where my children live. One day, a year and a half, two years ago, I found a bill. Wait, wait, wait. After losing the home, we were dragged to Colorado by another lie in the middle of the pandemic. I am stranded here in Durango, discovering all this, dealing with the trauma of discovering all this, losing everything I had, and also losing the remnants of whatever marriage I had. One day, a year and a half ago, I found a bill hidden under a bunch of stuff from the IRS for $18,000 that we owed for the year 2014. He denied knowing about it and would not discuss it. He said it was a mistake. I finally woke up and realized he has been lying and hiding things from me. Since I was married, I immediately called Community Tax for Help where I found out Sean had got a pension when he was fired from the town of East Longmeadow for $70,000. Honestly. $70,000 or $78,000? Maybe it was $78,000. They took $13,000. I knew nothing about it until Brian and Community Tax told me a few months ago that he had got the pension. I have lost all my little savings and now I have nothing. I need to get an attorney and also a psychiatrist. I cannot sleep. I've been prescribed anti-anxiety meds. I need to leave him, but most important, I need you, the IRS, to forgive all my responsibility tax-wise. He does admit he has ruined my life and bled me dry. He said he will support me on filing the 8857 tax form, innocent spouse. Also, he will compose a letter to be attached to this form and take full responsibility for errors and incomes hidden. That's what I got. And as I write and submit this, I continue to discover new things hidden from me and lied about to me. I put a lien on my bank account where my Social Security is. The only thing that they won't touch is my Social Security, but they already took everything else out of me. ```\nUse the above narrative as a master template for the narrative for 8857. Fill in appropriate details based on our conversation up till now. This form has to be worded to capture the suffering and deceptions mother went thru. Sprinkle with adjectives and examples as you see fit. Correct for grammar and sequential telling. Do not make too flowery but capture a serious tone.

                            "I, Barbara Kelly, am compelled to reach out for assistance after 32 years of marriage to my husband, Sean Kelly, who I have now found to have systematically deceived me. Throughout our marriage, I had no other choice but to trust him. Whenever I sensed red flags or inconsistencies in his actions, questioning him would lead to bouts of gaslighting, confusion, and lies so intricate that they would deceive even the most discerning person. I found myself emotionally coerced into a corner, making it futile to confront him. As a result, I've had to maintain an uncomfortable silence just to keep peace in our household. Over time, this built an insurmountable wall between us, eroding my trust and making our relationship increasingly estranged.\n\nFinancially, Sean has been nothing short of devastating. Unbeknownst to me, he borrowed money from my family members and even my children's friends, never repaying them. I was shocked to discover he had stopped paying the mortgage, leading to the foreclosure of our home\u2014a loss that wiped out all my investments. Following this, we moved to Colorado, once again on the premise of another lie, stranding me far away from the life I knew. My sense of betrayal and confusion reached a breaking point about a year and a half ago when I stumbled upon a hidden IRS bill for $18,000 dated back to the year 2014. Despite his denial and evasive behavior, I knew it was time to act. I reached out to Community Tax for assistance, only to unearth another staggering deception. Sean had received a pension of around $78,000 when he was terminated from his job in East Longmeadow, of which $13,000 was taken for taxes\u2014a sum I was completely unaware of until it was revealed to me by my consultant, Brian. \n\nMy emotional and financial wellbeing has been severely compromised, forcing me to seek psychiatric help and go on anti-anxiety medication just to cope. I find myself in the desperate position of needing to extricate myself from this marriage, and yet, I am now without means due to Sean's reckless and dishonest handling of our finances. Sean acknowledges the devastation he has caused in my life and has verbally committed to supporting my filing of the IRS Form 8857 for Innocent Spouse Relief. He has also agreed to attach a letter, taking full responsibility for the hidden income and tax discrepancies. However, as I write this, I continue to uncover more lies, deceptions, and financial missteps, including liens on my bank account, leaving me with nothing but my Social Security income. I earnestly plead with the IRS to consider my circumstances and absolve me of any tax obligations that I had no part in creating or concealing. Thank you for your attention to this distressing matter."

I admit that I unilaterally managed our household's finances, including the preparation and submission of tax documents, without the participation or knowledge of my wife, Barbara Kelly. I purposely concealed important financial information, like the IRS bill for $18,000 from 2014 and a pension of around $78,000 from the town of East Longmeadow. \n\nI also failed to maintain transparency with Barbara about various debts, including a lien from the State of Massachusetts for $11,000. I mishandled our finances to the extent that I stopped paying our mortgage without informing Barbara, leading to the foreclosure of our home and causing severe financial hardship. I even borrowed money from Barbara's family and our children's friends, never intending to repay them. \n\nI understand the emotional and financial toll this has taken on Barbara, and I affirm that she had no knowledge or part in these errors and omissions. She was not privy to my actions and was kept in the dark deliberately, in breach of the trust and partnership that should exist in a marriage. Barbara had no reason to suspect my handling of our finances and trusted me implicitly, a trust I have now irreparably broken. \n\nTherefore, I fully support Barbara's request for Innocent Spouse Relief via Form 8857 and attest to the facts stated in her application. I realize the gravity of my actions and am willing to face any penalties or consequences that may arise from my wrongful conduct. \n\nSincerely,\nSean Kelly"

I admit that I unilaterally managed our household's finances, including the preparation and submission of tax documents, without the participation or knowledge of my spouse, Barbara Kelly. I purposely concealed important financial information, like the IRS bill for $18,000 from 2014 and a pension of around $78,000 from the town of East Longmeadow. \n\nI also failed to maintain transparency with Barbara about various debts, including a lien from the State of Massachusetts for $11,000. I mishandled our finances to the extent that I stopped paying our mortgage without informing Barbara, leading to the foreclosure of our home and causing severe financial hardship. I even borrowed money from Barbara's family and our children's friends, never intending to repay them. \n\nI understand the emotional and financial toll this has taken on Barbara, and I affirm that she had no knowledge or part in these errors and omissions. She was not privy to my actions and was kept in the dark deliberately, in breach of the trust and partnership that should exist in a marriage. Barbara had no reason to suspect my handling of our finances and trusted me implicitly, a trust I have now irreparably broken. \n\nTherefore, I fully support Barbara's request for Innocent Spouse Relief via Form 8857 and attest to the facts stated in her application. I realize the gravity of my actions and am willing to face any penalties or consequences that may arise from my wrongful conduct. \n\nSincerely,\n\n____________________\n(Printed Name)\n\n____________________\n(Signature)\n\n____________________\n(Social Security Number)\n\n____________________\n(Date)\n\n```\n\n---\n\nYou can copy and paste this Markdown text into a text editor that supports Markdown formatting, or simply into a plain text editor, and then print it out for him to fill in and sign."

I found myself emotionally coerced into a corner, making it futile to confront him. As a result, I've had to maintain an uncomfortable silence just to keep peace in our household. Over time, this built an insurmountable wall between us, eroding my trust and making our relationship increasingly estranged.\n\nFinancially, Sean has been nothing short of devastating. Unbeknownst to me, he borrowed money from my family members and even my children's friends, never repaying them. I was shocked to discover he had stopped paying the mortgage, leading to the foreclosure of our home\u2014a loss that wiped out all my investments. Following this, we moved to Colorado, once again on the premise of another lie, stranding me far away from the life I knew. My sense of betrayal and confusion reached a breaking point about a year and a half ago when I stumbled upon a hidden IRS bill for $18,000 dated back to the year 2014. Despite his denial and evasive behavior, I knew it was time to act. I reached out to Community Tax for assistance, only to unearth another staggering deception. Sean had received a pension of around $78,000 when he was terminated from his job in East Longmeadow, of which $13,000 was taken for taxes\u2014a sum I was completely unaware of until it was revealed to me by my consultant, Brian.\n\nMy emotional and financial wellbeing has been severely compromised, forcing me to seek psychiatric help and go on anti-anxiety medication just to cope. I find myself in the desperate position of needing to extricate myself from this marriage, and yet, I am now without means due to Sean's reckless and dishonest handling of our finances. Sean acknowledges the devastation he has caused in my life and has verbally committed to supporting my filing of the IRS Form 8857 for Innocent Spouse Relief. He has also agreed to attach a letter, taking full responsibility for the hidden income and tax discrepancies. However, as I write this, I continue to uncover more lies, deceptions, and financial missteps, including liens on my bank account, leaving me with nothing but my Social Security income. I earnestly plead with the IRS to consider my circumstances and absolve me of any tax obligations that I had no part in creating or concealing. Thank you for your attention to this distressing matter.```"

                            "Certainly, let's take the original statement and enhance it with additional details to make sure it fully captures the extent of the hardship and deception Barbara has faced. The aim is to convincingly convey to the IRS that she deserves the Innocent Spouse Relief.\n\n---\n\nI, Barbara Kelly, find myself in the unfortunate position of needing to reach out for vital assistance after enduring 32 years of a marriage fraught with deception and emotional manipulation at the hands of my husband, Sean Kelly. From the outset, I gave him my trust\u2014believing that as a partner in marriage, he would act in our mutual best interests. Over the years, however, I discovered that questioning his actions, no matter how incongruent or suspicious they seemed, led me into a labyrinth of gaslighting, confusion, and elaborate falsehoods. These incidents weren't isolated; they were systematic and left me emotionally cornered. Any attempts at seeking clarity were met with hostility, leading me to maintain a stifling silence that eventually erected an insurmountable wall between us.\n\nThe gravity of my predicament became horrendously clear on the financial front. Sean engaged in a series of betrayals, borrowing money from family and even pilfering from my children's friends\u2014debts he had no intention of settling. He gambled away our financial security by ceasing mortgage payments without my knowledge, ultimately resulting in the foreclosure of our home. This catastrophic event vaporized the investments that I had poured into our property, forcing us to relocate to Colorado on the basis of yet another dishonest pretext, thereby severing me from my known surroundings and social support.\n\nThe tipping point came approximately 18 months ago when I accidentally discovered an IRS bill, concealed among miscellaneous items, for $18,000\u2014dated back to the year 2014. Despite Sean's predictable denials and attempts at evasion, I realized I could no longer afford the luxury of willful ignorance and sought assistance from Community Tax. It was here that I was hit with another staggering revelation: Sean had received a pension of approximately $78,000 upon his termination from the Town of East Longmeadow. Of this, $13,000 was siphoned off for taxes. Not only was I kept in the dark about this significant income, but I was also misled into believing that our financial affairs were in order.\n\nNow, I find myself in a dire state, both emotionally and financially compromised. I've been forced to consult psychiatrists, and I rely on anti-anxiety medication to navigate each day. My ultimate aim is to disentangle myself from this disastrous marriage; however, my means are severely limited due to Sean's irresponsible and deceptive financial machinations. Sean has verbally conceded to the ruin he has inflicted on my life. He has pledged to support my application for Innocent Spouse Relief, Form 8857, and committed to authoring a letter taking full responsibility for the concealed income and the resulting tax irregularities. Yet, as I pen this plea, I continue to stumble upon new betrayals\u2014financial traps and liens that have seized everything except my Social Security income.\n\nI urgently appeal to the IRS to acknowledge the severity of my situation. I had no hand in these financial transgressions and plead to be absolved from the tax obligations born out of Sean's actions. Your attention to this agonizing issue is deeply appreciated.\n\n---\n\nThis revised statement incorporates the original tone and amplifies it with additional details aimed at underlining Barbara's innocence and suffering. Please make sure this is reviewed thoroughly for factual accuracy and completeness before submission."

I always thought as husband and wife, we should trust each other. But every time I had questions or felt something was off, Sean would confuse me or lie so well that I ended up questioning myself instead. I was cornered emotionally and had no choice but to keep quiet just to avoid conflicts at home. \n\nFinancially, it's been a disaster. Sean borrowed money from my family and even from my kids' friends and never paid them back. He stopped paying the mortgage without me knowing, and we lost our home. All the money I put into that house is gone. Then we moved to Colorado, and I found out later it was based on another lie. I feel stranded and lost.\n\nThe worst part came about a year and a half ago when I found a hidden bill from the IRS saying we owed $18,000 from back in 2014. Sean said it was a mistake, but I knew better this time. I talked to Community Tax for help and found out Sean got a big pension of about $78,000 when he lost his job. And guess what? He didn't pay any taxes on it, which is a big reason why we're in this mess. I never knew about this money or that it wasn't taxed until the tax people told me.\n\nI'm now emotionally and financially drained. I've had to see a psychiatrist and I'm on anti-anxiety meds just to get through each day. I need to get out of this marriage but how can I? Sean has used up all our money. He says he knows he's ruined my life and will help me file for Innocent Spouse Relief on the IRS Form 8857. He even says he'll write a letter saying it's all his fault for hiding money and messing up our taxes. But even now, I keep finding out about more lies and bad financial stuff he's done, like liens that have taken everything except my Social Security.\n\nI'm begging the IRS to understand that I had no part in this. I didn't know, and I was kept in the dark on purpose. Please clear me of this tax mess that I didn't create. Thanks for taking the time to read this. \n\n---\n\nThis version aims to retain the key points while adopting a simpler, more straightforward tone.

Be aware that there are some small statments between myself and barbara in the recorded statment, which may account for some conflicting or repeated info.\n\n``````I, Barbara Kelly, am reaching out for assistance. I have been living with my husband, Sean Kelly, for 32 years. I chose to believe and trust him. Yes, there were red flags, but I found out if I say anything about my thoughts and those red flags, he would get angry, gaslight me, and completely confuse me. So, I ignored these instincts and had to trust him. I arrest taxes. I never questioned, as he is a smart man and knew in my heart he would do the right thing. I could never get involved in tax preparation. I also questioned his honesty, but if I questioned him at all, I would get nowhere and he would lie about his lies. I was so confused, so I chose to let it go. I learned to put up and shut up. In time, a wall was built between us. My trust was abused. We have grown apart for the last 10 years, the last 3 years being the worst. He is always needing money from me. He has borrowed from my family members without telling me, also stole stuff and borrowed from my children's friends and never paid them back. He stopped paying the mortgage unbeknownst to me. I lost all my investments into our home because he lost the house to foreclosure. After losing the home, we came to Colorado where my children live. One day, a year and a half, two years ago, I found a bill. Wait, wait, wait. After losing the home, we were dragged to Colorado by another lie in the middle of the pandemic. I am stranded here in Durango, discovering all this, dealing with the trauma of discovering all this, losing everything I had, and also losing the remnants of whatever marriage I had. One day, a year and a half ago, I found a bill hidden under a bunch of stuff from the IRS for $18,000 that we owed for the year 2014. He denied knowing about it and would not discuss it. He said it was a mistake. I finally woke up and realized he has been lying and hiding things from me. Since I was married, I immediately called Community Tax for Help where I found out Sean had got a pension when he was fired from the town of East Longmeadow for $70,000. Honestly. $70,000 or $78,000? Maybe it was $78,000. They took $13,000. I knew nothing about it until Brian and Community Tax told me a few months ago that he had got the pension. I have lost all my little savings and now I have nothing. I need to get an attorney and also a psychiatrist. I cannot sleep. I've been prescribed anti-anxiety meds. I need to leave him, but most important, I need you, the IRS, to forgive all my responsibility tax-wise. He does admit he has ruined my life and bled me dry. He said he will support me on filing the 8857 tax form, innocent spouse. Also, he will compose a letter to be attached to this form and take full responsibility for errors and incomes hidden. That's what I got. And as I write and submit this, I continue to discover new things hidden from me and lied about to me. I put a lien on my bank account where my Social Security is. The only thing that they won't touch is my Social Security, but they already took everything else out of me. ```"

                            "Certainly, here's a version of Barbara's statement that's closer to her recorded transcript while also incorporating some of the additional nuances and details:\n\n---\n\nI, Barbara Kelly, need help. I've been with my husband, Sean Kelly, for 32 years. I chose to trust him, but that trust was broken. When I saw red flags, questioning him only made things worse. He'd get mad, gaslight me, and confuse me more. I had to trust him; I had no choice. He dealt with taxes and wouldn't let me be a part of it. If I ever did question him, he'd lie even more. I felt lost, so I stopped asking questions. I learned to just keep quiet.\n\nOver the years, we've grown apart, especially in the last 3 years. He's always taking money, borrowing from my family and my children's friends without telling me. He even stopped paying our mortgage and we lost our home. All the money I invested into that house is gone. Then we moved to Colorado on another lie, and I feel trapped here. It's been hard dealing with all this, and I feel like I've lost everything, including any semblance of a marriage.\n\nAbout a year and a half ago, I found an IRS bill hidden away for $18,000 from 2014. Sean said it was a mistake but I didn't believe him this time. I contacted Community Tax for help and learned Sean got a pension of $78,000 when he was fired. They took $13,000 for taxes, but he never paid anything himself. I never knew about this money until Community Tax told me. \n\nI'm now drained, emotionally and financially. I can't sleep and I'm on anti-anxiety medication. I need an attorney, I need a psychiatrist, but mostly I need the IRS to clear me of this tax mess. Sean says he's messed up and will help me file for Innocent Spouse Relief with the IRS. He also promised to write a letter admitting to all the hidden income and tax issues. But as I write this, I keep finding more stuff he's hidden, including liens on my bank account. Now all I have left is my Social Security.\n\n---\n\nThis version keeps the essence of Barbara's original recorded statement while adding important details for the IRS. Feel free to review and adjust as needed."

For 32 years, I've been married to Sean Kelly, and I chose to trust him. But that trust has been exploited. Whenever I saw warning signs and tried to address them, he'd just get angry, manipulate me, and confuse the issue. So, I had no option but to trust him. He took control of our taxes and didn't allow me any involvement. When I did dare to question him, he'd weave a web of lies that left me lost and silenced.\n\nOur relationship has deteriorated over the years, hitting rock bottom in the last three. Sean has consistently taken money without my knowledge, even borrowing from my family and our children's friends, and never paying them back. He also secretly stopped paying our mortgage, causing us to lose our home and all my financial investments with it. Then he uprooted us to Colorado based on yet another lie, leaving me isolated and stranded.\n\nAbout 18 months ago, I discovered a hidden IRS bill for $18,000, dating back to 2014.

Sean admits he's ruined my life and promises to support my IRS filing by attaching a letter that confesses to all the hidden income and tax problems.

He took control of our taxes and didn't allow me any involvement. When I did dare to question him, he'd weave a web of lies that left me lost and silenced.\n\nOur relationship has deteriorated over the years, hitting rock bottom in the last three. Sean has consistently taken money without my knowledge, even borrowing from my family and our children's friends, and never paying them back. He also secretly stopped paying our mortgage, causing us to lose our home and all my financial investments with it. Then he uprooted us to Colorado based on yet another lie, leaving me isolated and stranded.\n\n\nAbout a year and a half ago, I stumbled upon a hidden IRS bill for $18,000 from 2014. When I confronted him, he brushed it off as a mistake. But this time, I wasn't buying his excuses. I reached out to Community Tax for clarification, and what I learned was shocking. It turns out, Sean had been fired from his job in 2014 for questionable behavior. At that time, he cashed out his pension early\u2014a total of $78,000\u2014and never told me about it. To make matters worse, he didn't pay any taxes on this lump sum, creating the massive tax bill I had discovered.

                            "I, Barbara Kelly, am in dire need of help. I've been married to Sean Kelly for 32 years, and he's shattered my trust and deceived me in ways I never saw coming. You know, I thought marriage was about trust, but every time I had suspicions, Sean would muddy the waters, lying so convincingly that I ended up doubting myself. This toxic cycle meant I was sidelined from our finances. Sean took charge of our taxes, and anytime I dared question anything, he'd spin tales that left me confused and silenced.\n\nThings have been going downhill for a while, really bottoming out these last three years. Sean's been taking money behind my back, borrowing from my own family and our kids' friends, and never repaying them. And get this, he stopped paying the mortgage without telling me, and we lost our home and my investment in it. Then, based on another lie, he dragged us to Colorado, leaving me stranded and cut off from everyone I know.\n\nAbout 18 months ago, I found an IRS bill for $18,000, hidden away and dated back to 2014. When I confronted Sean, he just called it a mistake. But I wasn't falling for it anymore. I reached out to Community Tax, and the truth hit me like a ton of bricks. Sean got fired in 2014 and cashed out his pension early\u2014$78,000 that I never knew about. And he didn't pay a dime in taxes on it, which led to that big ol' tax bill I found. I only learned about this hidden money through my work with Community Tax.\n\nI'm wiped out, both emotionally and financially. I can't sleep, and I've had to go on medication and get help. But my immediate need is for the IRS to hear me out and grant me Innocent Spouse Relief. As I'm putting this all down, more and more secrets keep popping up. I found out there's a lien on my bank account, the one my Social Security payments go into. He also lied about filing our taxes for 2017 and 2018. And to top it off, there's another $11,000 tax bill from Massachusetts that I just found out about. I'm begging the IRS, please understand that I had no hand in any of this."

I always thought as husband and wife, we should trust each other.

When I confronted him, he brushed it off as a mistake. But this time, I wasn't buying his excuses. I reached out to Community Tax for clarification, and what I learned was shocking. It turns out, Sean had been fired from his job in 2014 for questionable behavior. At that time, he cashed out his pension early\u2014a total of $78,000\u2014and never told me about it. To make matters worse, he didn't pay any taxes on this lump sum, creating the massive tax bill I had discovered. This vital information was kept from me until my consultations with Community Tax.\n\nI'm emotionally and financially drained. I've been losing sleep, and it's gotten so bad that I had to get on medication and seek professional help. But most urgently, I need the IRS to consider my plea for Innocent Spouse Relief. Even as I write this, I keep finding more hidden secrets. Among them, I discovered there's a lien on my bank account where my Social Security payments go.

But the things I'm going to talk about are, one, how Sean lied to my friends, borrowed money, did work, got paid but didn't finish with the work, and in two examples, how that strained my friendships. Two, I'm going to talk about how when I was staying with them, I thought it was so weird that even though Sean was working, everything seemed to be falling apart and there was always an excuse. I started to notice a pattern of ignoring things and things just generally got worse. And then three, I'm going to talk about how he lied to me and convinced me to convince mom to drop everything and move out to Colorado so he could run. And in actuality, he told me he had this house and job and mom was holding him up and blah, blah, blah. So those are the three main things I'm going to talk about."

                            "One point that makes this so challenging for me, too, is the fact that Sean has been a father to me. I've spent more time with him than my own father. We are also, quote-unquote, friends. But there were always things lingering around that just seemed off, and until this moment, never totally made sense. I'll talk about some of the things that resonate with me deepest, as the first things that pop to mind as I start thinking about this. I'll try to be brief, but am happy to expand upon any of these details, add details, or anything that's needed down the line, should that be necessary. One of the first things that pops into my head is how Sean's behavior strained relationships with two of my oldest, longest, and best friends. In one instance, unbeknownst to me, Sean had borrowed a substantial amount of money, thousands, I believe, from my best friend without telling me. Over time, I noticed that my friend and Sean, who had worked together in the past, and obviously he was a Taylor Tribe, had communicated less, or things had started getting a little tense or awkward between us three. Cutting to the chase, some years later, my friend had told me how Sean had borrowed a substantial sum and never paid him back and ignored him. This was devastating. Additionally, around the same time, I was living with one of my other best friends, Andy, in his house, and Sean had offered to tile his kitchen for him as he was going to sell his home. Sean let Tyler mix up the mortar and he did it wrong, but Sean used it anyway. And it screwed up the grout and discolored it, and I was still living in that home with Andy, and he was like, can Sean come fix this? For months, every time I came home and saw Andy, he would ask if Sean could come finish the job and fix it. And Sean always would tell me, I got it, I'll handle it, don't worry, I'll get back to him. I'll work it out, blah, blah, blah. Anyway, come to find out, he never did. My friend just stopped calling Sean, and a giant kitchen job was just left partially finished and damaged. Both of these instances have left permanent stains on the friendship, because not only did I have to explain to my friends why my stepfather was stiffing them without knowing why, but we also had all of this hanging over us until this day. That was story one."

It's clear that Sean has not only borrowed money and neglected responsibilities, but also damaged your friendships in a lasting way. You were caught in the middle of Sean's financial and professional irresponsibilities. This led to awkwardness and tension between you and your friends, which is understandably upsetting.

And I was always, always confused as to why a handyman with a good job was decaying in every way. And I use decay in place of a better term that I can't think of yet. But his health was declining, the house was falling apart, and at the same time, relationships around him were falling apart. And it all seemed to revolve around a lack of money. Always, always, always, always. And it just got worse and worse over the years. I never understood why, and I never got an answer why. There was always some excuse. I'll just leave it there. But by the time I had left, we had a roof caving in, a water heater that didn't work and that we had to manually fill with diesel fuel. I saw them both have health and dental problems they couldn't afford to fix. They were always barely surviving on a car. And this just got progressively worse. And I wondered, how is all this happening, even though Sean has a full-time job, Then he got fired. And everything just continued on that path. But at that point, the decay and the decline and the house falling apart, for years, and then after he got fired, he never really got another solid job again and did odd jobs for a while. But since I've known him, he... My mom married a lawyer, which I thought was fantastic, but then he lost that job and started doing something else, and then he lost that job, and now that I look back, he kept losing jobs until the East Longmeadow job, and then it was just odd jobs after that. And things got worse and worse. Until Story 3."

                            "The third idea, this happened while I was in Colorado, during the beginning of the pandemic. Actually, probably during the peak of the worst time of the pandemic, when everything was closed or closing. Nobody knew anything. I was in Colorado, and my mom was in Springfield with Sean and my ailing grandfather, who needed care from my mom. Somehow, Sean and I, or Sean started sending me pictures of a place in Durango that his son, my half-brother, was working at. And Sean started talking about how they couldn't afford the house anymore, and it was probably going to get foreclosed on because they couldn't keep up with the payments, and there was so much falling apart. And I was like, I know. I know. I've been watching it fall apart. And he told me in such a way that I felt bad and I felt like I wanted to help, somehow. But he started telling me about this great new opportunity out in Colorado, being the maintenance guy for this resort. And he showed me video of the house that they would move into, and he basically sold it to me as this brand new beginning for him and mom, and Grampy, who was being taken care of by my mom. All they had to do was get out there as quickly as possible. And this meant, literally, dropping and leaving everything immediately to get to Colorado as fast as possible to hop on this life-changing opportunity, and all he needed was my help and help convincing mom. He made it sound like mom was holding him back, and that I needed to tell her to let go of things like her antique sewing machine and all her things. Basically, he convinced me to convince my own mother to drop her entire life and everything she owns, and has ever owned, and leave it out in the open to come out here, so Sean could start his new life and their new life. And so I did. Not only did I convince my mom, but I convinced her brothers to do it, and I flew out there, and in hours, everybody left their lives behind and came up to Colorado. And we left our home behind. Little did I know that this was not a dream job, and it was not a step to improve their lives, it was to run away from Massachusetts because the walls had closed in around him. Now, my mother is here in this situation."

                            "My relationship with Sean, my stepfather for many years, has always been a complex blend of trust, friendship, and a father-son dynamic. The trouble is, there have always been these unsettling gaps, moments that didn't quite add up. And now, as the fog clears, I find myself in a position where I have to reconcile my past relationship with Sean with the painful truth that has recently come to light.\n\nFirstly, there were the incidents involving my closest friends, financial transactions that never quite closed, leaving behind a trail of strained relationships. Sean borrowed a considerable sum from one of my lifelong friends and never paid him back, turning a simple transaction into a thorny knot that neither of us could untangle. The tension is palpable even today. Around the same time, he botched a kitchen tiling job at another friend's house. My friend kept asking me to get Sean to finish the work, to fix the mess he left behind. Sean would assure me he'd take care of it, but he never did. What's left now is a legacy of broken promises, partially completed jobs, and friendships that bear the weight of it all.\n\nSecondly, there was the noticeable decay when I lived with Sean and my mom for a period while attending college. A handyman by trade, with a job that was supposed to provide, I couldn't understand why everything around us was falling apart. The house, the cars, their health\u2014everything was deteriorating. He lost his job, and the decline that had been gradual before now went into a nosedive. I felt tremendous stress because I knew my mom was not safe, emotionally or financially, yet neither of us had the full picture.\n\nFinally, there was the move to Colorado, a chapter of our lives sold to us as a new beginning. Sean convinced me to convince my mother and her family to leave behind their entire lives in Springfield and move to Colorado. It was supposed to be this incredible opportunity for Sean, a fresh start. Only after we had uprooted our lives did I find out that this move was not an upgrade but an escape route for Sean. We were not chasing a dream; we were fleeing a nightmare. \n\nNow, my mother and I find ourselves in an unprecedented situation. We're not just navigating an uncertain future; we're also rewriting a past that we thought we knew. Here we are, faced with the dreadful task of appealing to the IRS, trying to shield my mother from any legal repercussions for things she had no knowledge of, for a life built on lies she didn't tell. We are victims in a story we didn't even know we were a part of, and now we're left to pick up the pieces."

Imagine what it's like to suddenly be in a position where your two best friends um have both been fucked over by your own stepfather who you introduced them to, and that was how our relationships went, and uh, I don't know, I drifted away from them, and we don't talk anymore. That was how those friendships fizzled. Um, with that, um, I can't imagine that didn't project on to me and the rest of my family, like it's just a subconscious human reaction and adjustment about how you feel someone given what you now realize. Nothing ill was said, it was just kind of like finally, they told me each in their way, and it was just like they shrugged their shoulders and kind of like, what the fuck, not to me, so to say, but like to the air, and uh, I had only embarrassment. And then, um, yeah, and to this day, to this day, man, that sucks."

                            "Absolutely. Here's the revised narrative for the first idea, incorporating the new emotional layers you've provided:\n\nFor years, Sean has been more than just a stepfather to me; he's also been a friend. So, it was natural for him to get to know my own friends, people who have been constants in my life. But over time, I've found that Sean's actions have put indelible stains on my closest friendships, ultimately severing ties that were years in the making. In one particularly painful episode, Sean borrowed a significant amount of money from my best friend\u2014thousands, I later found out\u2014without my knowledge. As the months rolled by, I couldn't help but sense a growing tension whenever all three of us were together. My friend eventually revealed Sean's unpaid debt, devastating me and irrevocably changing the dynamics of our friendship.\n\nAround the same time, Sean had agreed to tile the kitchen of another close friend, Andy, who I was living with at the time. Sean let his son Tyler mix the mortar incorrectly, but used it anyway, ruining the grout and the overall job. Every time I saw Andy, he'd ask when Sean was going to come fix it. And every time, Sean reassured me that he would \"handle it.\" He never did. The kitchen remained a damaged work-in-progress, and the friendship with Andy began to erode, much like the grout.\n\nImagine having to face your friends, knowing that your own stepfather has betrayed their trust. I'm not only left with the task of explaining why Sean isn't making things right, but also grappling with the reality that these friendships have fizzled out\u2014left to die under the weight of Sean's broken promises. While nothing explicitly harsh was said, the air thickened with unspoken disappointment and confusion. And to this day, those friendships have never recovered. I can't help but think how my friends' perceptions of me and my family have been altered, not through any fault of my own, but because of Sean's deceit.\n\nThe tragedy here isn't just the monetary loss or the unfinished kitchen; it's the erosion of trust and the long-term impact on relationships that were supposed to withstand the test of time. Now, I'm left picking up the pieces, wondering how one person's actions could create such a ripple effect of ruin."

I admit that I unilaterally managed our household's finances, including the preparation and submission of tax documents, without the participation or knowledge of my spouse, Barbara Kelly. I purposely concealed important financial information, like the IRS bill for $18,000 from 2014 and a pension of around $78,000 from the town of East Longmeadow. \n\nI also failed to maintain transparency with Barbara about various debts, including a lien from the State of Massachusetts for $11,000. I mishandled our finances to the extent that I stopped paying our mortgage without informing Barbara, leading to the foreclosure of our home and causing severe financial hardship. I even borrowed money from Barbara's family and our children's friends, never intending to repay them. \n\nI understand the emotional and financial toll this has taken on Barbara, and I affirm that she had no knowledge or part in these errors and omissions. She was not privy to my actions and was kept in the dark deliberately, in breach of the trust and partnership that should exist in a marriage. Barbara had no reason to suspect my handling of our finances and trusted me implicitly, a trust I have now irreparably broken. \n\nTherefore, I fully support Barbara's request for Innocent Spouse Relief via Form 8857 and attest to the facts stated in her application. I realize the gravity of my actions and am willing to face any penalties or consequences that may arise from my wrongful conduct. \n\nSincerely,\n\n____________________\n(Printed Name)\n\n____________________\n(Signature)\n\n____________________\n(Social Security Number)\n\n____________________\n(Date)\n\n"

Sean, my stepfather and, in many ways, a friend, has caused me not only emotional turmoil but also significant social and familial ramifications due to his financial mismanagement and deceitful behavior.\n\nFirstly, Sean's actions have had a detrimental effect on two of my longest-standing friendships. Sean borrowed a significant sum from one friend without my knowledge and never repaid it. This has led to a tension that ultimately severed our friendship. Another friend, Andy, experienced a botched home improvement job by Sean. Despite numerous assurances, Sean never returned to fix the incomplete tiling job, adding another layer of strain to our friendship. These betrayals have significantly fractured friendships that have lasted for years, leaving me with lasting emotional scars and social repercussions.\n\nSecondly, during a period I lived with them, I witnessed our household's steady decline, despite Sean having regular employment at the time. What was particularly distressing was the atmosphere of persistent financial stress. By the time I left, the house was in disrepair, essential utilities were not functioning, and there was a noticeable decline in Sean's and Barbara\u2019s health\u2014issues that they could not afford to fix. When Sean eventually lost his job, the decline only accelerated, leading me to worry constantly about my mother's wellbeing.\n\nLastly, I want to address an episode during the peak of the pandemic, where Sean manipulated me into convincing my mother and family to abruptly move to Colorado for a supposed life-changing job opportunity. This not only uprooted everyone's life but was also a lie designed to escape the mounting financial troubles in Massachusetts. My mother is now left in a precarious situation, writing letters to the IRS to avoid criminal culpability for issues she was entirely unaware of and is a victim of.\n\nThe consequence of Sean\u2019s actions reaches far beyond just financial mismanagement. It has destroyed trust, severed relationships, and left my mother and me grappling with an uncertain future, both financially and emotionally. I fully support my mother's application for Innocent Spouse Relief via Form 8857 and hope this narrative serves as additional evidence of the extent of Sean's deceit and mismanagement."

                            "Here is the narrative that my mother wrote- it is this narrative that I am trying to support. I wonder if you can offer a new version of my narrative (without changing tone or making it sound contrived) that makes it subtly look like some of her points are being supported with my narrative.\n\n\"\"\"Form 8857: Request for Innocent Spouse Relief\nQuestion 24: Additional Information and Narrative\nI, Barbara Kelly, am in dire need of help.\n\nFor 32 years, I've been married to Sean Kelly. He has broken my trust and deceived me in ways I never thought possible. I always thought as husband and wife, we should trust each other. But every time I had questions or felt something was off, Sean would confuse me or lie so well that I ended up questioning myself instead. This pattern of deception and manipulation made it impossible for me to play an active role in our financial life. He took control of our taxes and didn't allow me any involvement. When I did dare to question him, he'd weave a web of lies that left me lost and silenced.\n\nOur relationship has deteriorated over the years, hitting rock bottom in the last three. Sean has consistently taken money without my knowledge, even borrowing from my family and our children's friends, and never paying them back. He also secretly stopped paying our mortgage, causing us to lose our home and all my financial investments with it. Then he uprooted us to Colorado based on yet another lie, leaving me isolated and stranded.\n\nAbout a year and a half ago, I stumbled upon a hidden IRS bill for $18,000 from 2014. I panicked. When I confronted him, he brushed it off as a mistake. But this time, I wasn't buying his excuses. I reached out to Community Tax for clarification, and what I learned was shocking. It turns out, Sean had been fired from his job in 2014 for questionable behavior. At that time, he cashed out his pension early\u2014a total of $78,000\u2014and never told me about it. To make matters worse, he didn't pay any taxes on this lump sum, creating the massive tax bill I had discovered. This vital information was kept from me until my consultations with Community Tax.\n\nI'm emotionally and financially drained. I've been losing sleep, and it's gotten so bad that I had to get on medication and seek professional help. But most urgently, I need the IRS to consider my plea for Innocent Spouse Relief. Even as I write this, I keep finding more hidden secrets. Among them, I discovered there's a lien on my bank account where my Social Security payments go. On top of that, he claimed to have filed our taxes for 2017 and 2018, but I found out that wasn't true either. I also recently learned about $11,000 in taxes owed to Massachusetts. I am begging the IRS to please understand that I had no part in this.\n\n\"\"\""

                            "## To Whom It May Concern,\n\nI, _______________ (Printed Name), am writing in full support of my mother, Barbara Kelly, to offer this narrative as a nuanced glimpse into the tangled web of financial mismanagement and deceit Sean has woven around our lives\u2014although I am happy to expand upon these details further if necessary. My purpose here is to offer a testimonial that buttresses my mother's application for Innocent Spouse Relief via Form 8857.\n\nFirst, Sean's manipulative behaviors extend beyond just financial matters, affecting my friendships and thereby isolating me, much like he has isolated my mother over their 32-year marriage. He borrowed money from a dear friend of mine without my prior knowledge, destroying a friendship I cherished, and he never repaid that loan. He also botched a home improvement job for another friend, which had similar fallout. This pattern of borrowing and not repaying\u2014shared by both my mother and me\u2014paints a fuller picture of Sean's willingness to deceive, and the consequential erosion of trust.\n\nSecondly, during a tumultuous period of our lives when I lived at home, I became increasingly aware of a certain decay in our household's standard of living. These were early signs that Sean was mishandling finances, creating an emotionally taxing environment for everyone involved, my mother included. But whenever questions were raised, Sean would create confusing narratives to deflect responsibility\u2014similar to how he managed to keep my mother in the dark about their financial status.\n\nLastly, I can corroborate my mother's sense of being uprooted based on deceit. Sean persuaded me to help him convince my mother to move to Colorado for what he claimed was a fantastic job opportunity. My mother and I both dropped our lives in Massachusetts, deceived into thinking this was a step forward. In reality, it was a means for Sean to escape mounting debts and the foreclosure of our family home\u2014a crucial detail that he hid from us.\n\nJust like my mother, I'm also discovering the depths of Sean's deceptions, as he craftily manipulated family members and even myself in various schemes that have now left us facing financial and emotional ruin. To this day, we're grappling with the repercussions, including dealing with institutions like the IRS to absolve my mother of criminal liabilities she had no part in creating.\n\nTherefore, I fervently support my mother's application for Innocent Spouse Relief via Form 8857 and offer this narrative as further emotional and financial context. I urge you to consider this testament as you review her plea, for she is as much a victim in this as anyone else.\n\nSincerely,\n\n____________________  \n(Printed Name)\n\n____________________  \n(Signature)\n\n____________________  \n(Date)"

So, it was natural for him to get to know my own friends, people who have been constants in my life. But over time, I've found that Sean's actions have put indelible stains on my closest friendships, ultimately severing ties that were years in the making. In one particularly painful episode, Sean borrowed a significant amount of money from my best friend\u2014thousands, I later found out\u2014without my knowledge. As the months rolled by, I couldn't help but sense a growing tension whenever all three of us were together. My friend eventually revealed Sean's unpaid debt, devastating me and irrevocably changing the dynamics of our friendship.\n\nAround the same time, Sean had agreed to tile the kitchen of another close friend, Andy, who I was living with at the time. Sean let his son Tyler mix the mortar incorrectly, but used it anyway, ruining the grout and the overall job. Every time I saw Andy, he'd ask when Sean was going to come fix it. And every time, Sean reassured me that he would \"handle it.\" He never did.

His actions, however, have left a lasting impact on these friendships. He borrowed a large sum from my best friend without my knowledge, causing a rift that was never repaired. My friend eventually revealed the unpaid debt, shattering the trust that was foundational to our relationship. \n\nAround the same time, Sean also agreed to tile the kitchen of another friend, Andy, who I was living with. Sean botched the job, and despite promises to fix it, never returned to make it right. This negligence left both the kitchen and my friendship with Andy in a state of disrepair. Now, I find myself grappling with the repercussions of Sean's broken promises, not just explaining his failures to my friends but also dealing with the emotional aftermath. The strain has been immense, affecting not just my social circle but how others view me and my family."

And I was always, always confused as to why a handyman with a good job was decaying in every way. And I use decay in place of a better term that I can't think of yet. But his health was declining, the house was falling apart, and at the same time, relationships around him were falling apart. And it all seemed to revolve around a lack of money. Always, always, always, always. And it just got worse and worse over the years. I never understood why, and I never got an answer why. There was always some excuse. I'll just leave it there. But by the time I had left, we had a roof caving in, a water heater that didn't work and that we had to manually fill with diesel fuel. I saw them both have health and dental problems they couldn't afford to fix. They were always barely surviving on a car. And this just got progressively worse. And I wondered, how is all this happening, even though Sean has a full-time job, Then he got fired. And everything just continued on that path. But at that point, the decay and the decline and the house falling apart, for years, and then after he got fired, he never really got another solid job again and did odd jobs for a while. But since I've known him, he... My mom married a lawyer, which I thought was fantastic, but then he lost that job and started doing something else, and then he lost that job, and now that I look back, he kept losing jobs until the East Longmeadow job, and then it was just odd jobs after that. And things got worse and worse\n```"

Actually, probably during the peak of the worst time of the pandemic, when everything was closed or closing. Nobody knew anything. I was in Colorado, and my mom was in Springfield with Sean and my ailing grandfather, who needed care from my mom. Somehow, Sean and I, or Sean started sending me pictures of a place in Durango that his son, my half-brother, was working at. And Sean started talking about how they couldn't afford the house anymore, and it was probably going to get foreclosed on because they couldn't keep up with the payments, and there was so much falling apart. And I was like, I know. I know. I've been watching it fall apart. And he told me in such a way that I felt bad and I felt like I wanted to help, somehow. But he started telling me about this great new opportunity out in Colorado, being the maintenance guy for this resort. And he showed me video of the house that they would move into, and he basically sold it to me as this brand new beginning for him and mom, and Grampy, who was being taken care of by my mom. All they had to do was get out there as quickly as possible. And this meant, literally, dropping and leaving everything immediately to get to Colorado as fast as possible to hop on this life-changing opportunity, and all he needed was my help and help convincing mom. He made it sound like mom was holding him back, and that I needed to tell her to let go of things like her antique sewing machine and all her things. Basically, he convinced me to convince my own mother to drop her entire life and everything she owns, and has ever owned, and leave it out in the open to come out here, so Sean could start his new life and their new life. And so I did. Not only did I convince my mom, but I convinced her brothers to do it, and I flew out there, and in hours, everybody left their lives behind and came up to Colorado. And we left our home behind. Little did I know that this was not a dream job, and it was not a step to improve their lives, it was to run away from Massachusetts because the walls had closed in around him. Now, my mother is here in this situation.```\n\n\n\nAnd then add to the well written short summary below. Simply expand it in the same style to ad slightly more nuance:\n\nLastly, Sean manipulated me into convincing my mother to abruptly relocate our family to Colorado for a purportedly life-changing job opportunity, which turned out to be a deceitful maneuver to escape financial woes in Massachusetts. This has left my mother in a precarious situation, now having to write to the IRS to avoid criminal culpability for issues she had no knowledge of and is a victim of.\n"

GIven that I have spent more time living and working with Sean than my own father (who I maintain a regular relationship with) I feel that my perspective carries weight and offer here a few examples that immediately arise, and with the discovery of the terrible news now make more sense looking back through this new context. \nFirstly, Sean's actions have had a detrimental effect on two of my longest-standing friendships. For years, Sean has been more than just a stepfather to me; he's also been a friend. So, it was natural for him to get to know my own friends, people who have been constants in my life. But over time, I've found that Sean's actions have put indelible stains on my closest friendships, ultimately severing ties that were years in the making. In one particularly painful episode, Sean borrowed a significant amount of money from my best friend\u2013a thousand or more, I later found out\u2014without my knowledge. As the months rolled by, I couldn't help but sense a growing tension whenever all three of us were together. My friend eventually revealed Sean had asked for the money, and then never paid it back, and ultimately my friend felt too uncomfortable to keep asking , devastating me and irrevocably changing the dynamics of our friendship.\nAround a similar time period, Sean had agreed to tile the kitchen of another close friend, Andy, who I was living with at the time. Sean let his son (my half-brother) mix the mortar, but when mixed incorrectly, instead of fixing the problem with another batch,  used it anyway, ruining the grout and the overall job. I absolutely needed to be fixed and every time I saw Andy, almost daily for a long time, he'd ask when Sean was going to come fix it. And every time, Sean reassured me that he would \"handle it.\" He never did. The kitchen remained a damaged work-in-progress, and the friendship with Andy began to erode.This pattern of borrowing and not repaying or following through\u2014shared by both my mother and me\u2014paints a fuller picture of Sean's willingness to deceive, and the consequential erosion of trust.\nDuring the years I lived with Sean and my mother while attending college midlife, I was always baffled by the continual decay surrounding us. Despite Sean having a seemingly stable job with local government and a long history as a handyman, everything around them seemed to be falling apart. There was always a deeply mysterious shortage of money, leading to a deteriorating home with things like a caving roof and a dysfunctional water heater. They couldn't afford necessary medical and dental treatments, and even keeping a car running was a struggle. Despite his full-time employment, the decline in our living conditions never abated, and we remained in a perpetual state of him \u2018handling it\u2019. Things only worsened when he did lose his job. \n\nA few year back, during the uncertain times of the early month of the endemic, Sean saw an opportunity to manipulate me while I was in Colorado and my mom home in caring for my ailing grandfather. He painted a rosy picture of a new life in Colorado, complete with a stable job and videos of the new \u2018house\u2019 they would live in.He claimed they couldn't afford to keep their Massachusetts home, and this was their ticket to a fresh start. Convincing me that my mom was the one holding them back, he enlisted me to persuade him to abandon her life and most things she owned to move to Colorado Within days. I recently discovered that this wasn't about new beginnings; it appears to have been Sean's desperate attempt to escape mounting financial and personal troubles in Massachusetts. Sean not only manipulated me into convincing my own mother and to uproot their lives for a \"life-changing opportunity\" in Colorado. The move was neither a dream job nor a step forward; it was a deliberate evasion. As a result, my mother finds herself entangled in a complex web of financial issues she had no hand in, so dire that she is now forced to plead with the IRS for Innocent Spouse Relief to avoid consequences for problems she is entirely a victim of. Her future is not only irreconcilably changed forever but so is her past. \n\n\nI thank you for taking the time to read this and for understanding the terrible situation she finds herself in. \n```"

Given that I have spent more time living and working with Shawn than my own father (with whom I maintain a regular relationship), I feel that my perspective carries significant weight and useful perspective.

Having lived with Shawn longer than my own father, my perspective carries weight. I'll illustrate this with some key examples that now make more sense in light of recent discoveries.\n\nShawn's actions have fractured two of my long-standing friendships. He borrowed a large sum from my best friend without my knowledge and never repaid it, straining our relationship. Around the same time, he agreed to tile my roommate Andy's kitchen, botched the job, and never fixed it. These incidents erode trust and reveal Shawn's deceitful tendencies.\n\nDuring my college years, despite Shawn's stable job and handyman skills, our home continually decayed. Essential repairs and medical treatments were always out of reach, causing us to live in a state of decline. \n\nA few years ago, Shawn manipulated me into persuading my mother to leave Massachusetts for a supposed new life in Colorado. I later found this to be a scheme to evade growing financial and personal troubles. As a result, my mother now faces severe financial issues she didn't create and must plead for Innocent Spouse Relief from the IRS.\n\nThank you for understanding the dire situation my mother finds herself in."

                            "I'm writing in support of my mother, Barbara Kelly, to shed light on the deceitful web Shawn, my stepfather, has woven around our lives. Given that I've spent more time living with Shawn than my own father, my perspective holds weight. I'll share examples that illuminate his damaging actions.\n\nShawn has hurt two of my longest-standing friendships. He borrowed a large sum from my best friend without telling me. Over time, this created tension and ultimately devastated our friendship. Similarly, Shawn agreed to tile the kitchen of my friend Andy but botched the job. Despite promises, he never fixed it, eroding another important relationship. This pattern, shared by my mother and me, reveals Shawn's deceitful nature.\n\nWhile attending college midlife, I lived with Shawn and my mother. Despite Shawn having a stable job, our living conditions continually decayed due to an unexplained lack of funds. Essential needs like medical treatments and car repairs were neglected.\n\nA few years ago, Shawn manipulated me into convincing my mom to move to Colorado, supposedly for a fresh start. I later discovered it was to evade financial troubles in Massachusetts. Consequently, my mother is now ensnared in financial complications, forcing her to seek Innocent Spouse Relief from the IRS.\n\nThank you for reading and understanding this unfortunate situation."

Shawn, my stepfather and, in many ways, a friend, has caused me not only emotional turmoil but also social and familial ramifications due to his financial mismanagement and deceitful behavior. Given that I have spent more time living and working with Shawn than my own father (with whom I maintain a regular relationship), I feel that my perspective carries significant weight and useful perspective. I offer here a few examples that immediately arise and, with the discovery of the terrible news, now make more sense looking back through this new context.\nFirstly, Shawn's actions have had a detrimental effect on two of my longest-standing friendships. For years, Shawn has been more than just a stepfather to me; he's also been a friend. So, it was natural for him to get to know my own friends, people who have been constants in my life. But over time, I've found that Shawn's actions have put indelible stains on my closest friendships, permanently damaging ties that were years in the making. In one particularly painful episode, Shawn borrowed a significant amount of money from my best friend\u2014a thousand or two, or more, I later found out\u2014without my knowledge. As the months rolled by, I couldn't help but sense a growing tension whenever all three of us were together, and even between my friend and I alone. My friend eventually revealed Shawn had asked for the money and then never paid it back; ultimately, my friend felt too uncomfortable to keep asking, devastating me and changing the dynamics of our friendship.\nAround a similar time period, Shawn had agreed to tile the kitchen of another close friend, Andy, with whom I was living at the time. Shawn let his son (my half-brother) mix the mortar but, when mixed incorrectly, for some reason used it anyway, ruining the grout and the overall job. It absolutely needed to be fixed, and every time I saw Andy, almost daily as I lived with him, he'd ask when Shawn was going to come fix it. And every time, Shawn reassured me that he would \"handle it.\" and \u201ccall Andy\u201d. He never did. The kitchen remained a damaged work-in-progress, and the friendship with Andy began to erode. This pattern of borrowing and not repaying or following through\u2014shared by both my mother and me\u2014paints a fuller picture of Shawn's willingness to deceive and the consequential erosion of trust.\nDuring the years I lived with Shawn and my mother while attending college midlife, I was always baffled by the continual decay surrounding us. Despite Shawn having a good, stable job with a local town government, and a long history as a handyman, everything around them seemed to be falling apart. There was always a deeply mysterious shortage of money, leading to a deteriorating home with things like a caving roof and a years-long fuel heating fuel shortage. They couldn't afford necessary medical and dental treatments, and even keeping a car running was a struggle. Despite his full-time employment, the decline in our living conditions never abated, and we remained in a perpetual state of him 'handling it'. Things only worsened when he did lose his job.\nA few years back, during the uncertain times of the early months of the pandemic, Shawn saw an opportunity to manipulate me while I was in Colorado and my mom was home, caring for my ailing grandfather. He painted a rosy picture of a new life in Colorado, complete with a stable job and videos of the new 'house' they would live in. He claimed they couldn't afford to keep their Massachusetts home and that this was their ticket to a fresh start. Convincing me that my mom was the one holding them back, he enlisted me to persuade her to abandon her life and most things she owned to move to Colorado within days. I recently discovered that this wasn't about new beginnings; it appears to have been Shawn's desperate attempt to escape mounting financial and personal troubles in Massachusetts. Shawn not only manipulated me into convincing my own mother to uproot their lives for a \"life-changing opportunity\" in Colorado. The move was neither a dream job nor a step forward; it was a deliberate evasion. As a result, my mother finds herself entangled in a complex web of financial issues she had no hand in, so dire that she is now forced to plead with the IRS for Innocent Spouse Relief to avoid consequences for problems she is entirely a victim of. Her future is not only irreconcilably changed forever but so is her past.\nI thank you for taking the time to read this and for understanding the terrible situation she finds herself in.\n\n```"

                            "I am writing in full support of my mother, Barbara Kelly, to offer this narrative as a glimpse into the web of deceit Shawn has woven around our lives. Shawn, my stepfather and, in many ways, a friend, has caused me not only emotional turmoil but also social and familial ramifications due to his financial mismanagement and deceitful behavior. Given that I have spent more time living and working with Shawn than my own father (with whom I maintain a regular relationship), I feel that my perspective carries significant weight. I offer here a few examples that immediately arise and, with the discovery of the terrible news, now make more sense looking back through this new context.\n\nFirstly, Shawn's actions have had a detrimental effect on two of my longest-standing friendships. For years, Shawn has been more than just a stepfather to me; he's also been a friend. So, it was natural for him to get to know my own friends, people who have been constants in my life. But over time, I've found that Shawn's actions have put indelible stains on my closest friendships, permanently damaging ties that were years in the making. In one particularly painful episode, Shawn borrowed a significant amount of money from my best friend\u2014a thousand or two, I later found out\u2014without my knowledge. As the months rolled by, I couldn't help but sense a growing tension whenever all three of us were together, and even between my friend and me alone. My friend eventually revealed Shawn had asked for the money and then never paid it back; ultimately, my friend felt too uncomfortable to keep asking, devastating me and changing the dynamics of our friendship.\n\nAround a similar time period, Shawn had agreed to tile the kitchen of another close friend, Andy, with whom I was living at the time. Shawn let his son (my half-brother) mix the mortar but, when mixed incorrectly, used it anyway, ruining the grout and the overall job. It absolutely needed to be fixed, and every time I saw Andy, almost daily as I lived with him, he'd ask when Shawn was going to come fix it. And every time, Shawn reassured me that he would \"handle it\" and \"call Andy.\" He never did. The kitchen remained a damaged work-in-progress, and the friendship with Andy began to erode. This pattern of borrowing and not repaying or following through\u2014shared by both my mother and me\u2014paints a fuller picture of Shawn's willingness to deceive and the consequential erosion of trust.\n\nDuring the years I lived with Shawn and my mother while attending college midlife, I was always baffled by the continual decay surrounding us. Despite Shawn having a good, stable job with local town government and a long history as a handyman, everything around us seemed to be falling apart. There was always a deeply mysterious shortage of money, leading to a deteriorating home with issues like a caving roof and a years-long heating fuel shortage. They couldn't afford necessary medical and dental treatments, and even keeping a car running was a struggle. Despite his full-time employment, the decline in our living conditions never abated, and we remained in a perpetual state of him 'handling it.' Things only worsened when he did lose his job.\n\nA few years back, during the uncertain times of the early months of the pandemic, Shawn saw an opportunity to manipulate me while I was in Colorado and my mom was home, caring for my ailing grandfather. He painted a rosy picture of a new life in Colorado, complete with a stable job and videos of the new 'house' they would live in. He claimed they couldn't afford to keep their Massachusetts home and that this was their ticket to a fresh start. Convincing me that my mom was the one holding them back, he enlisted me to persuade her to abandon her life and most things she owned to move to Colorado within days. I recently discovered that this wasn't about new beginnings; it appears to have been Shawn's desperate attempt to escape mounting financial and personal troubles in Massachusetts. Shawn not only manipulated me into convincing my own mother to uproot their lives for a \"life-changing opportunity\" in Colorado; the move was neither a dream job nor a step forward\u2014it was a deliberate evasion. As a result, my mother finds herself entangled in a complex web of financial issues she had no hand in, so dire that she is now forced to plead with the IRS for Innocent Spouse Relief to avoid consequences for problems she is entirely a victim of. Her future is not only irreconcilably changed forever, but so is her past.\n\nI thank you for taking the time to read this and for understanding the terrible situation she finds herself in."

Given that I've lived with Shawn more than my own father, my perspective carries weight. I offer some examples that, given recent revelations, make more sense.\n\nFirstly, Shawn's actions have impacted two of my longest friendships. He's been more than a stepfather; he's been a friend. Over time, Shawn's actions have damaged these relationships. In one episode, Shawn borrowed money from my best friend\u2014a significant amount\u2014without my knowledge. As time passed, tension grew between all of us. My friend revealed Shawn never repaid the loan, which changed our friendship's dynamics.\n\nAround the same period, Shawn agreed to tile my friend Andy's kitchen. Despite mixing the mortar incorrectly, he used it, ruining the job. Every time I saw Andy, he asked when Shawn would fix it. Shawn always said he'd \"handle it\" but never did, eroding another friendship. This pattern of deceit has been harmful to both my mother and me.\n\nDuring my midlife college years, despite Shawn's stable job and handyman skills, our living conditions worsened. A perpetual shortage of funds led to a deteriorating home and lack of essential medical treatments. Even maintaining a car was challenging. Despite his job, our decline continued, worsened by his eventual job loss.\n\nA few years back, Shawn manipulated me into convincing my mom to move to Colorado, framing it as a fresh start. I later learned this was an escape from his problems in Massachusetts. He manipulated me into persuading my mother to abandon her life, resulting in her entanglement in a complex financial web, including needing to plea for Innocent Spouse Relief with the IRS. \n\nI thank you for understanding the dire situation my mother faces."

                            "Please make the following a little less wordy/flowery but do not remove any details. Small edits.\n\nI am writing in full support of my mother, Barbara Kelly, to offer this narrative as a glimpse into the web of deceit Shawn has woven around our lives. Shawn, my stepfather and, in many ways, a friend, has caused me not only emotional turmoil but also social and familial ramifications due to his financial mismanagement and deceitful behavior. Given that I have spent more time living and working with Shawn than my own father (with whom I maintain a regular relationship), I feel that my perspective carries significant weight. I offer here a few examples that immediately arise and, with the discovery of the terrible news, now make more sense looking back through this new context.\n\nFirstly, Shawn's actions have had a detrimental effect on two of my longest-standing friendships. For years, Shawn has been more than just a stepfather to me; he's also been a friend. So, it was natural for him to get to know my own friends, people who have been constants in my life. But over time, I've found that Shawn's actions have put indelible stains on my closest friendships, permanently damaging ties that were years in the making. In one particularly painful episode, Shawn borrowed a significant amount of money from my best friend\u2014a thousand or two, I later found out\u2014without my knowledge. As the months rolled by, I couldn't help but sense a growing tension whenever all three of us were together, and even between my friend and me alone. My friend eventually revealed Shawn had asked for the money and then never paid it back; ultimately, my friend felt too uncomfortable to keep asking, devastating me and changing the dynamics of our friendship.\n\nAround a similar time period, Shawn had agreed to tile the kitchen of another close friend, Andy, with whom I was living at the time. Despite mixing the mortar incorrectly, he used it anyway, ruining the grout and the overall job. A major  fix was needed, and every time I saw Andy, almost daily as I lived with him, he'd ask when Shawn was going to come fix it. And every time, Shawn reassured me that he would \"handle it\" and  he\u2019d \"call Andy.\" He never did. The kitchen remained a damaged work-in-progress, and the friendship with Andy began to erode. This pattern of borrowing and not repaying or following through\u2014shared by both my mother and me\u2014paints a fuller picture of Shawn's willingness to deceive and the consequential erosion of trust.\n\nDuring the years I lived with Shawn and my mother while attending college midlife, I was always baffled by the continual decay surrounding us. Despite Shawn having a good, stable job with the local town government and a long history as a handyman, everything around us seemed to be falling apart. There was always a deeply mysterious shortage of money, leading to a deteriorating home with issues like a caving roof and a years-long heating fuel shortage. They couldn't afford necessary medical and dental treatments, and even keeping a car running was a struggle. Despite his full-time employment, the decline in our living conditions never abated, and we remained in a perpetual state of him 'handling it.' Things only worsened when he did lose his job.\n\nA few years back, during the uncertain times of the early months of the pandemic, Shawn saw an opportunity to manipulate me while I was in Colorado and my mom was home, caring for my ailing grandfather. He painted a rosy picture of a new life in Colorado, complete with a stable job and videos of the new 'house' they would live in. He claimed they couldn't afford to keep their Massachusetts home and that this was their ticket to a fresh start. Convincing me that my mom was the one holding them back, he enlisted me to persuade her to abandon her life and most things she owned to move to Colorado within days. I recently discovered that this wasn't about new beginnings; it appears to have been Shawn's desperate attempt to escape mounting financial and personal troubles in Massachusetts. Shawn not only manipulated me into convincing my own mother to uproot their lives for a \"life-changing opportunity\" in Colorado; the move was neither a dream job nor a step forward\u2014it was a deliberate evasion. As a result, my mother finds herself entangled in a complex web of financial issues she had no hand in, so dire that she is now forced to plead with the IRS for Innocent Spouse Relief to avoid consequences for problems she is entirely a victim of. Her future is not only irreconcilably changed forever, but so is her past.\n\nI thank you for taking the time to read this and for understanding the terrible situation she finds herself in.\n"

                            "Photographing a solar eclipse requires specialized equipment and settings to both capture the event effectively and protect your camera sensor from damage. Here are some general guidelines for a Canon 90D or similar DSLR:\n\n1. **Lens Choice**: A telephoto lens with a focal length of at least 300mm is generally recommended for capturing detailed images of the sun.\n\n2. **Solar Filter**: It's essential to use a solar filter over the lens to protect your camera's sensor and your eyes.\n\n3. **ISO**: A low ISO, such as 100 or 200, will give you cleaner images.\n\n4. **Aperture**: You'll probably want to stop down the lens to around f/8 or f/11 to get a sharp image.\n\n5. **Shutter Speed**: Start with a faster shutter speed like 1/1000 and adjust as needed based on your test shots.\n\n6. **Focus**: Set your lens to manual focus and adjust to infinity. You can use live view to fine-tune this.\n\n7. **Image Stabilization**: If you're using a tripod, turn off any image stabilization to prevent any counterproductive adjustments the lens or camera might make.\n\n8. **RAW Format**: Shooting in RAW will give you more flexibility in post-processing.\n\n9. **Bracketing**: Consider using exposure bracketing to capture a range of exposures; you can then select the best shot or create an HDR image in post-processing.\n\n10. **Timer or Remote**: To minimize camera shake, use a timer or a remote trigger.\n\nRemember that these are just starting points; you'll want to take some test shots and adjust your settings as needed. Always follow safety guidelines to protect both your eyes and your equipment."

                            "Yes, most modern DSLRs like the Canon 90D allow you to set up automatic exposure bracketing (AEB). Once set, pressing the shutter button once will automatically take multiple shots at different exposures. Here's how you can typically set it up:\n\n1. Go to your camera menu and look for the AEB option. It's usually represented by three overlapping frames or found in the shooting menu.\n  \n2. Select the range of exposures you want to bracket. You can usually set how many stops apart each shot should be (e.g., +/- 1, +/- 2, etc.).\n\n3. Make sure your camera is set to a drive mode that supports multiple shots. 'Continuous shooting' mode is often a good choice.\n\n4. Press the shutter button once, and the camera will automatically take the specified number of shots at different exposure levels.\n\nConsult your camera's manual for detailed instructions specific to the Canon 90D."

Make sure your battery is fully charged.\n\nIf you've tried all of these steps and you're still experiencing issues, it may be necessary to have the camera and/or lens professionally serviced."

I\u2019m so glad you\u2019re here. \nL77: \nL78: I have a lot to learn and figure out as I get this going. I\u2019m not sure yet how often I\u2019ll post nor which topics I\u2019ll focus on, but I\u2019m working towards finding a cadence so that you\u2019ll know when to expect to hear from me. Thanks for bearing with me in these early days. \nL79: \nL80: One thing I DO know: I wanted to start by writing about generative artificial intelligence (AI). I have a few posts planned for the coming weeks, but don\u2019t worry, this won\u2019t be an AI-only newsletter.\nL81: \nL82: For me, the most important first step schools can take with AI is to help educators make sense of it.\nL83: \nL84: In the workshops I\u2019ve led on generative AI and assessment, and in the many conversations with schools I\u2019ve had over the months since ChatGPT made its debut last year, I\u2019ve found that educators, particularly teachers and staff who work directly with students, are experiencing a range of emotions about AI: skepticism, excitement, anxiety, resolve, and exhaustion. The sudden explosion of AI is just the most recent in a seemingly relentless string of challenges to the teaching profession since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic in 2020. \nL85: \nL86: I recently left a great job at \u30104\u2020a great organization\u2020globalonlineacademy.org\u3011 where I spent a decade working with teachers and administrators on using technology and learner-centered design to improve the student experience. For me, there are two essential elements to supporting educators in adapting to innovations in education: purpose and practice. We need to be clear about why an innovation is relevant to their work and to their students, and then we need to introduce some basic strategies that give them enough confidence to explore on their own. The goal is not to get educators to fall in love with an innovation, it\u2019s to help them make sense of it so they can make informed decisions on their own. \nL87: \nL88: In that spirit, below are questions, guidelines, and examples of ways I\u2019ve used AI myself and with educators in order to make sense of it. This is by no means a comprehensive list: I would love for you to add your own ideas and suggestions in the comments. \nL89: \nL90: Thanks for reading Learning on Purpose!

For example, I was moved by \u30105\u2020this English teacher\u2019s reframing of AI\u2020www.nytimes.com\u3011 from \u201ccheating\u201d to \u201cassistance.\u201d I prefer these questions to the more general and more abstract (and very common) \u201cWhat should we do about AI?\u201d How we frame AI for ourselves as educators will affect how we frame it for our students, and I believe strongly that how we talk to students about AI will have a lasting impact on how they see its role in their own lives. \nL105: \nL106: ## Three Principles for Using AI\nL107: \nL108: Start with what you know. I was a middle and high school English teacher for 12 years, so most of my practice with AI has focused on things like grammar and essay writing and literary analysis. Why? Because I was in a position to assess the quality of AI\u2019s responses. My content knowledge has helped me craft prompts and follow-up questions to coach AI to produce better work. \nL109: \nL110: Focus on process, not product. We should be worried about artifacts of work that AI creates for us and for students, but we should be equally aware of how it can support our learning and work processes. Consider three areas: efficiency (can I get things done faster with AI?), effectiveness (can it make my work better?), and innovation (can it help me process and act on new ideas?). \nL111: \nL112: Prioritize dialogue over prompting. Not unlike those of human beings, AI\u2019s first attempts are rarely that great. Fortunately, it responds well to coaching and feedback. I am encouraging educators to spend less time trying to craft perfect initial prompts and instead engage AI in more sustained dialogue: ask it to do something, then nudge it and redirect it and correct it several times. Pay attention to how it learns what you want and then quickly improves its work in surprising ways.\nL113: \nL114: [Image]\nL115: \nL116: Midjourney: \u201ca laptop and an iphone and a notebook and an apple and a pencil on a wooden desk in the style of an oil still life\u201d\nL117: \nL118: ## Seven Things to Try\nL119: \nL120: For me, the best way to make sense of AI is to use it. These tools are powerful, but they are imperfect. They have enormous potentials and pitfalls for our world, but the tools available to most of us are accessible and easy to use. They are already doing amazingly sophisticated work in fields like medicine and technology and business, but they also have simple and practical applications in our day-to-day lives. \nL121: \nL122: Open up a chatbot like \u30106\u2020ChatGPT\u2020chat.openai.com\u3011 or \u30107\u2020Bing\u2020www.bing.com\u3011 or \u30108\u2020Bard\u2020bard.google.com\u3011 or \u30109\u2020Claude\u2020claude.ai\u3011 and give a few of the below ideas a try. All of these tools are free to use (sometimes with limits). Do this with colleagues! This kind of work is wonderful to do in groups, first because it\u2019s more fun and second because you can compare notes and share ideas in real time. It\u2019s a way to normalize open, collaborative exploration of AI.\nL123: \nL124: Create a Rubric. I have found AI chatbots to be particularly good at generating learning outcomes like competencies, standards, and performance levels for rubrics. Here\u2019s a prompt I used: \u201cGenerate a rubric in table format for the competency \u2018Communicate effectively with AI.\u2019 Include five sub-competencies. Articulate four performance levels for each subcompetency: novice, improving, mastering, and advanced.\u201d What would you ask AI to do after you saw this first attempt?\nL125: \nL126: [Image]\nL127: \nL128: (Re)design Feedback. Input into AI an example of written feedback you have given to a student or a colleague (with any personal or identifying information removed). Ask it to give you feedback on your feedback. Ask it to reformat the feedback from narrative to bullet points (or vice versa) in order to highlight key points. Ask it to rewrite the feedback (be warmer, be more direct, be more specific, etc.). Ask it to look for bias. Ask it to generate\nVisible: 0% - 49%",

I\u2019m not sure yet how often I\u2019ll post nor which topics I\u2019ll focus on, but I\u2019m working towards finding a cadence so that you\u2019ll know when to expect to hear from me. Thanks for bearing with me in these early days. \nL79: \nL80: One thing I DO know: I wanted to start by writing about generative artificial intelligence (AI). I have a few posts planned for the coming weeks, but don\u2019t worry, this won\u2019t be an AI-only newsletter.\nL81: \nL82: For me, the most important first step schools can take with AI is to help educators make sense of it.\nL83: \nL84: In the workshops I\u2019ve led on generative AI and assessment, and in the many conversations with schools I\u2019ve had over the months since ChatGPT made its debut last year, I\u2019ve found that educators, particularly teachers and staff who work directly with students, are experiencing a range of emotions about AI: skepticism, excitement, anxiety, resolve, and exhaustion. The sudden explosion of AI is just the most recent in a seemingly relentless string of challenges to the teaching profession since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic in 2020. \nL85: \nL86: I recently left a great job at a great organization where I spent a decade working with teachers and administrators on using technology and learner-centered design to improve the student experience. For me, there are two essential elements to supporting educators in adapting to innovations in education: purpose and practice. We need to be clear about why an innovation is relevant to their work and to their students, and then we need to introduce some basic strategies that give them enough confidence to explore on their own. The goal is not to get educators to fall in love with an innovation, it\u2019s to help them make sense of it so they can make informed decisions on their own. \nL87: \nL88: In that spirit, below are questions, guidelines, and examples of ways I\u2019ve used AI myself and with educators in order to make sense of it. This is by no means a comprehensive list: I would love for you to add your own ideas and suggestions in the comments. \nL89: \nL90: Thanks for reading Learning on Purpose!

For example, I was moved by this English teacher\u2019s reframing of AI from \u201ccheating\u201d to \u201cassistance.\u201d I prefer these questions to the more general and more abstract (and very common) \u201cWhat should we do about AI?\u201d How we frame AI for ourselves as educators will affect how we frame it for our students, and I believe strongly that how we talk to students about AI will have a lasting impact on how they see its role in their own lives. \nL105: \nL106: ## Three Principles for Using AI\nL107: \nL108: Start with what you know. I was a middle and high school English teacher for 12 years, so most of my practice with AI has focused on things like grammar and essay writing and literary analysis. Why? Because I was in a position to assess the quality of AI\u2019s responses. My content knowledge has helped me craft prompts and follow-up questions to coach AI to produce better work. \nL109: \nL110: Focus on process, not product. We should be worried about artifacts of work that AI creates for us and for students, but we should be equally aware of how it can support our learning and work processes. Consider three areas: efficiency (can I get things done faster with AI?), effectiveness (can it make my work better?), and innovation (can it help me process and act on new ideas?). \nL111: \nL112: Prioritize dialogue over prompting. Not unlike those of human beings, AI\u2019s first attempts are rarely that great. Fortunately, it responds well to coaching and feedback. I am encouraging educators to spend less time trying to craft perfect initial prompts and instead engage AI in more sustained dialogue: ask it to do something, then nudge it and redirect it and correct it several times. Pay attention to how it learns what you want and then quickly improves its work in surprising ways.\nL113: \nL114: [Image]\nL115: \nL116: Midjourney: \u201ca laptop and an iphone and a notebook and an apple and a pencil on a wooden desk in the style of an oil still life\u201d\nL117: \nL118: ## Seven Things to Try\nL119: \nL120: For me, the best way to make sense of AI is to use it. These tools are powerful, but they are imperfect. They have enormous potentials and pitfalls for our world, but the tools available to most of us are accessible and easy to use. They are already doing amazingly sophisticated work in fields like medicine and technology and business, but they also have simple and practical applications in our day-to-day lives. \nL121: \nL122: Open up a chatbot like ChatGPT or Bing or Bard or Claude and give a few of the below ideas a try. All of these tools are free to use (sometimes with limits). Do this with colleagues! This kind of work is wonderful to do in groups, first because it\u2019s more fun and second because you can compare notes and share ideas in real time. It\u2019s a way to normalize open, collaborative exploration of AI.\nL123: \nL124: Create a Rubric. I have found AI chatbots to be particularly good at generating learning outcomes like competencies, standards, and performance levels for rubrics. Here\u2019s a prompt I used: \u201cGenerate a rubric in table format for the competency \u2018Communicate effectively with AI.\u2019 Include five sub-competencies. Articulate four performance levels for each subcompetency: novice, improving, mastering, and advanced.\u201d What would you ask AI to do after you saw this first attempt?\nL125: \nL126: [Image]\nL127: \nL128: (Re)design Feedback. Input into AI an example of written feedback you have given to a student or a colleague (with any personal or identifying information removed). Ask it to give you feedback on your feedback. Ask it to reformat the feedback from narrative to bullet points (or vice versa) in order to highlight key points. Ask it to rewrite the feedback (be warmer, be more direct, be more specific, etc.). Ask it to look for bias. Ask it to generate\nVisible: 0% - 49%",

We need to be clear about why an innovation is relevant to their work and to their students, and then we need to introduce some basic strategies that give them enough confidence to explore on their own. The goal is not to get educators to fall in love with an innovation, it\u2019s to help them make sense of it so they can make informed decisions on their own. \nL87: \nL88: In that spirit, below are questions, guidelines, and examples of ways I\u2019ve used AI myself and with educators in order to make sense of it. This is by no means a comprehensive list: I would love for you to add your own ideas and suggestions in the comments. \nL89: \nL90: Thanks for reading Learning on Purpose!

For example, I was moved by this English teacher\u2019s reframing of AI from \u201ccheating\u201d to \u201cassistance.\u201d I prefer these questions to the more general and more abstract (and very common) \u201cWhat should we do about AI?\u201d How we frame AI for ourselves as educators will affect how we frame it for our students, and I believe strongly that how we talk to students about AI will have a lasting impact on how they see its role in their own lives. \nL105: \nL106: ## Three Principles for Using AI\nL107: \nL108: Start with what you know. I was a middle and high school English teacher for 12 years, so most of my practice with AI has focused on things like grammar and essay writing and literary analysis. Why? Because I was in a position to assess the quality of AI\u2019s responses. My content knowledge has helped me craft prompts and follow-up questions to coach AI to produce better work. \nL109: \nL110: Focus on process, not product. We should be worried about artifacts of work that AI creates for us and for students, but we should be equally aware of how it can support our learning and work processes. Consider three areas: efficiency (can I get things done faster with AI?), effectiveness (can it make my work better?), and innovation (can it help me process and act on new ideas?). \nL111: \nL112: Prioritize dialogue over prompting. Not unlike those of human beings, AI\u2019s first attempts are rarely that great. Fortunately, it responds well to coaching and feedback. I am encouraging educators to spend less time trying to craft perfect initial prompts and instead engage AI in more sustained dialogue: ask it to do something, then nudge it and redirect it and correct it several times. Pay attention to how it learns what you want and then quickly improves its work in surprising ways.\nL113: \nL114: [Image]\nL115: \nL116: Midjourney: \u201ca laptop and an iphone and a notebook and an apple and a pencil on a wooden desk in the style of an oil still life\u201d\nL117: \nL118: ## Seven Things to Try\nL119: \nL120: For me, the best way to make sense of AI is to use it. These tools are powerful, but they are imperfect. They have enormous potentials and pitfalls for our world, but the tools available to most of us are accessible and easy to use. They are already doing amazingly sophisticated work in fields like medicine and technology and business, but they also have simple and practical applications in our day-to-day lives. \nL121: \nL122: Open up a chatbot like ChatGPT or Bing or Bard or Claude and give a few of the below ideas a try. All of these tools are free to use (sometimes with limits). Do this with colleagues! This kind of work is wonderful to do in groups, first because it\u2019s more fun and second because you can compare notes and share ideas in real time. It\u2019s a way to normalize open, collaborative exploration of AI.\nL123: \nL124: Create a Rubric. I have found AI chatbots to be particularly good at generating learning outcomes like competencies, standards, and performance levels for rubrics. Here\u2019s a prompt I used: \u201cGenerate a rubric in table format for the competency \u2018Communicate effectively with AI.\u2019 Include five sub-competencies. Articulate four performance levels for each subcompetency: novice, improving, mastering, and advanced.\u201d What would you ask AI to do after you saw this first attempt?\nL125: \nL126: [Image]\nL127: \nL128: (Re)design Feedback. Input into AI an example of written feedback you have given to a student or a colleague (with any personal or identifying information removed). Ask it to give you feedback on your feedback. Ask it to reformat the feedback from narrative to bullet points (or vice versa) in order to highlight key points. Ask it to rewrite the feedback (be warmer, be more direct, be more specific, etc.). Ask it to look for bias. Ask it to generate\nVisible: 0% - 49%",

My favorite part of these kinds of events is hearing the questions people ask. Questions are the best data: they reveal not just what people want to know, but what they are worrying about, what they are excited about, and how they are thinking about the topic at hand. \nL77: \nL78: There\u2019s a section in one of my workshops that begins with the question, \u201cHow might students use AI to help them think?\u201d I offer some examples of ways students could use AI for learning, not instead of learning. Soon after I finished this section, a member of the audience asked a question (I\u2019m paraphrasing it):\nL79: \nL80: If students need to struggle in order to learn, why would we encourage them to use AI?\nL81: \nL82: I love this question. It gets to the heart of what causes learning. I\u2019ve been thinking about it since that session and wanted to expand on the answer I gave at the time (which I hope was helpful!). \nL83: \nL84: Thanks for reading Learning on Purpose! Subscribe for free to receive new posts and support my work.\nL85: \nL86: Subscribe\nL87: \nL88: We often conflate struggle with rigor: that in order for students to learn, they need to do things that are hard. The problem with the term rigor is that it is too often associated with output (pages read, hours studied, courses taken, levels completed). At its worst, rigor is difficulty without purpose, more about assessing what students can endure rather than what they have learned. \nL89: \nL90: Yet research on learning suggests inputs (meaningful tasks that are aligned to students\u2019 prior knowledge and responsive to student values, culture, and identity) and process (scaffolding, differentiation, feedback) are more important when it comes to ensuring students feel challenged and supported so that they can learn. Outputs are simply how we assess how well students used the inputs to navigate the learning process. \nL91: \nL92: If we look at Lev Vygotsky's\u30104\u2020 Zone of Proximal Development \u2020dictionary.apa.org\u3011(ZPD) or Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi\u2019s concept of \u30105\u2020Flow\u2020bookshop.org\u3011, students learn when they take on challenging tasks that are emotionally satisfying and involve the guidance of a skilled partner like a teacher, tutor, or peer.\nL93: \nL94: I like this simple rendering of the concepts:\nL95: \nL96: [Image: Image of two line graphs that capture ZPD and Flow in between lanes of \"bored\" and \"confused\" or \"anxiety\"]\nL97: \nL98: \u30106\u2020Source: Peeters and Van den Bosch, \u201cSituated Cognitive Engineering: The Requirements and Design of Directed Scenario-Based Training\u201d\u2020www.researchgate.net\u3011\nL99: \nL100: Designing learning experiences for challenge is different than simply making things hard. There are both cognitive and noncognitive components to what enables students to succeed at challenging tasks before veering into confusion or anxiety. \u30107\u2020Cognitive load theory\u2020my.chartered.college\u3011 explains that the brain has limited capacity to process new information, and it will stop processing it once overwhelmed. Camille Farrington\u2019s research (among many other examples) shows \u30108\u2020belonging, relevance, and confidence in success all contribute to deeper learning\u2020www.hewlett.org\u3011 because they are factors in 1) the student\u2019s trust in the teacher and in the value of the task and 2) their motivation to try something new or hard. The complexity of teaching is guiding students to the right places in the learning process where they can focus their precious cognitive and emotional energy on the tasks that will increase knowledge and competence. Aiming for struggle through rigor without considering emotional satisfaction and meaningful support undermines the process.\nL101: \nL102: ### AI and Bloom\u2019s Taxonomy\nL103: \nL104: The question that interests me when it comes to AI and learning is: can AI improve a student\u2019s chances of finding the right zone for learning? Let\u2019s start with Bloom\u2019s Taxonomy: \nL105: \nL106: [Image: Image of a slide with the question \"How might AI develop or deepen a student's ability to...\" above an image of Bloom's taxonomy rendered as a rainbow pyramid]\nL107: \nL108: 1. AI can be a guide. AI can already perform many of the functions that a tutor or a skilled peer or a parent can when it comes to providing the guidance students need to find the right zone for learning. \nL109: \nL110:   * Remember: AI can assist a student in memorizing vocabulary or formulas by learning and presenting the information in a variety of formats.\nL111: \nL112:   * Understand: AI can assist a student with processing information by organizing or explaining it in different ways. \nL113: \nL114:   * Apply: AI can model a potential way to solve a problem in a way that allows the student to create their own solution and compare it to AI\u2019s.\nL115: \nL116:   * Analyze: AI can assist students with analysis by reviewing their work and asking follow-up questions.\nL117: \nL118:   * Evaluate: AI can assist students by generating alternative arguments or perspectives for the student to critique.\nL119: \nL120:   * Create: AI can assist students in creation by offering feedback and elaboration on their new ideas. \nL121: \nL122: We are already \u30109\u2020seeing studies that suggest\u2020www.oneusefulthing.org\u3011 that using AI for complex knowledge work improves performance over not using it and is particularly effective at accelerating improvement for lower-level performers. Perhaps using AI knocks down some of the cognitive and emotional barriers that hold these performers back from learning deeply. Perhaps it offers assistance not previously accessible to them (like human tutors). Perhaps it smooths out the simpler or less important parts of the process to ensure they\u2019re fresh for complex tasks. The cause might not be clear, but the impact is already apparent: AI can help us work at all levels of Bloom\u2019s. \nL123: \nL124: 2. Learning to use AI is itself a productive struggle. In his excellent newsletter \u201cIntentional Teaching\u201d (\u301010\u2020you can subscribe here\u2020derekbruff.org\u3011), Derek Bruff writes, \u201cSomething I've observed about the use of generative AI for hard tasks, at least so far, is that experts can coach an AI to produce expert-level work, but novices in a particular domain cannot\u2026As teachers our job is to help our students develop expertise whether or not those students use AI technologies along the way. The really interesting question for me is, where can generative AI help develop that expertise?\u201d\nL125: \nL126: I find it so much more compelling to consider how to design for expertise than for rigor. Learning how to use AI is challenging (in the good way) because of the critical thinking involved in analyzing responses, creating prompts, and understanding how to train AI\nVisible: 0% - 45%",

Subscribe for free to receive new posts and support my work.\n\nSubscribe\n\nWe often conflate struggle with rigor: that in order for students to learn, they need to do things that are hard. The problem with the term rigor is that it is too often associated with output (pages read, hours studied, courses taken, levels completed). At its worst, rigor is difficulty without purpose, more about assessing what students can endure rather than what they have learned. \n\nYet research on learning suggests inputs (meaningful tasks that are aligned to students\u2019 prior knowledge and responsive to student values, culture, and identity) and process (scaffolding, differentiation, feedback) are more important when it comes to ensuring students feel challenged and supported so that they can learn. Outputs are simply how we assess how well students used the inputs to navigate the learning process. \n\nIf we look at Lev Vygotsky's\u30104\u2020 Zone of Proximal Development \u2020dictionary.apa.org\u3011(ZPD) or Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi\u2019s concept of \u30105\u2020Flow\u2020bookshop.org\u3011, students learn when they take on challenging tasks that are emotionally satisfying and involve the guidance of a skilled partner like a teacher, tutor, or peer.\n\nI like this simple rendering of the concepts:\n\n[Image: Image of two line graphs that capture ZPD and Flow in between lanes of \"bored\" and \"confused\" or \"anxiety\"]\n\n\u30106\u2020Source: Peeters and Van den Bosch, \u201cSituated Cognitive Engineering: The Requirements and Design of Directed Scenario-Based Training\u201d\u2020www.researchgate.net\u3011\n\nDesigning learning experiences for challenge is different than simply making things hard. There are both cognitive and noncognitive components to what enables students to succeed at challenging tasks before veering into confusion or anxiety. \u30107\u2020Cognitive load theory\u2020my.chartered.college\u3011 explains that the brain has limited capacity to process new information, and it will stop processing it once overwhelmed. Camille Farrington\u2019s research (among many other examples) shows \u30108\u2020belonging, relevance, and confidence in success all contribute to deeper learning\u2020www.hewlett.org\u3011 because they are factors in 1) the student\u2019s trust in the teacher and in the value of the task and 2) their motivation to try something new or hard. The complexity of teaching is guiding students to the right places in the learning process where they can focus their precious cognitive and emotional energy on the tasks that will increase knowledge and competence. Aiming for struggle through rigor without considering emotional satisfaction and meaningful support undermines the process.\n\n### AI and Bloom\u2019s Taxonomy\n\nThe question that interests me when it comes to AI and learning is: can AI improve a student\u2019s chances of finding the right zone for learning? Let\u2019s start with Bloom\u2019s Taxonomy: \n\n[Image: Image of a slide with the question \"How might AI develop or deepen a student's ability to...\" above an image of Bloom's taxonomy rendered as a rainbow pyramid]\n\n1. AI can be a guide. AI can already perform many of the functions that a tutor or a skilled peer or a parent can when it comes to providing the guidance students need to find the right zone for learning. \n\n  * Remember: AI can assist a student in memorizing vocabulary or formulas by learning and presenting the information in a variety of formats.\n\n  * Understand: AI can assist a student with processing information by organizing or explaining it in different ways. \n\n  * Apply: AI can model a potential way to solve a problem in a way that allows the student to create their own solution and compare it to AI\u2019s.\n\n  * Analyze: AI can assist students with analysis by reviewing their work and asking follow-up questions.\n\n  * Evaluate: AI can assist students by generating alternative arguments or perspectives for the student to critique.\n\n  * Create: AI can assist students in creation by offering feedback and elaboration on their new ideas. \n\nWe are already \u30109\u2020seeing studies that suggest\u2020www.oneusefulthing.org\u3011 that using AI for complex knowledge work improves performance over not using it and is particularly effective at accelerating improvement for lower-level performers. Perhaps using AI knocks down some of the cognitive and emotional barriers that hold these performers back from learning deeply. Perhaps it offers assistance not previously accessible to them (like human tutors). Perhaps it smooths out the simpler or less important parts of the process to ensure they\u2019re fresh for complex tasks. The cause might not be clear, but the impact is already apparent: AI can help us work at all levels of Bloom\u2019s. \n\n2. Learning to use AI is itself a productive struggle. In his excellent newsletter \u201cIntentional Teaching\u201d (\u301010\u2020you can subscribe here\u2020derekbruff.org\u3011), Derek Bruff writes, \u201cSomething I've observed about the use of generative AI for hard tasks, at least so far, is that experts can coach an AI to produce expert-level work, but novices in a particular domain cannot\u2026As teachers our job is to help our students develop expertise whether or not those students use AI technologies along the way. The really interesting question for me is, where can generative AI help develop that expertise?\u201d\n\nI find it so much more compelling to consider how to design for expertise than for rigor. Learning how to use AI is challenging (in the good way) because of the critical thinking involved in analyzing responses, creating prompts, and understanding how to train AI through feedback and dialogue. Using it well also involves avoiding the negative effects of regular use (\u30109\u2020see the same study I cited above\u2020www.oneusefulthing.org\u3011) that can stifle critical thinking. Negotiating these differences requires guided practice. ",

My favorite part of these kinds of events is hearing the questions people ask. Questions are the best data: they reveal not just what people want to know, but what they are worrying about, what they are excited about, and how they are thinking about the topic at hand. \n\nThere\u2019s a section in one of my workshops that begins with the question, \u201cHow might students use AI to help them think?\u201d I offer some examples of ways students could use AI for learning, not instead of learning. Soon after I finished this section, a member of the audience asked a question (I\u2019m paraphrasing it):\n\nIf students need to struggle in order to learn, why would we encourage them to use AI?\n\nI love this question. It gets to the heart of what causes learning. I\u2019ve been thinking about it since that session and wanted to expand on the answer I gave at the time (which I hope was helpful!). \n\nThanks for reading Learning on Purpose!

The problem with the term rigor is that it is too often associated with output (pages read, hours studied, courses taken, levels completed). At its worst, rigor is difficulty without purpose, more about assessing what students can endure rather than what they have learned. \n\nYet research on learning suggests inputs (meaningful tasks that are aligned to students\u2019 prior knowledge and responsive to student values, culture, and identity) and process (scaffolding, differentiation, feedback) are more important when it comes to ensuring students feel challenged and supported so that they can learn. Outputs are simply how we assess how well students used the inputs to navigate the learning process. \n\nIf we look at Lev Vygotsky's\u30104\u2020 Zone of Proximal Development \u2020dictionary.apa.org\u3011(ZPD) or Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi\u2019s concept of \u30105\u2020Flow\u2020bookshop.org\u3011, students learn when they take on challenging tasks that are emotionally satisfying and involve the guidance of a skilled partner like a teacher, tutor, or peer.\n\nI like this simple rendering of the concepts:\n\n[Image: Image of two line graphs that capture ZPD and Flow in between lanes of \"bored\" and \"confused\" or \"anxiety\"]\n\n\u30106\u2020Source: Peeters and Van den Bosch, \u201cSituated Cognitive Engineering: The Requirements and Design of Directed Scenario-Based Training\u201d\u2020www.researchgate.net\u3011\n\nDesigning learning experiences for challenge is different than simply making things hard. There are both cognitive and noncognitive components to what enables students to succeed at challenging tasks before veering into confusion or anxiety. \u30107\u2020Cognitive load theory\u2020my.chartered.college\u3011 explains that the brain has limited capacity to process new information, and it will stop processing it once overwhelmed. Camille Farrington\u2019s research (among many other examples) shows \u30108\u2020belonging, relevance, and confidence in success all contribute to deeper learning\u2020www.hewlett.org\u3011 because they are factors in 1) the student\u2019s trust in the teacher and in the value of the task and 2) their motivation to try something new or hard. The complexity of teaching is guiding students to the right places in the learning process where they can focus their precious cognitive and emotional energy on the tasks that will increase knowledge and competence. Aiming for struggle through rigor without considering emotional satisfaction and meaningful support undermines the process.\n\n### AI and Bloom\u2019s Taxonomy\n\nThe question that interests me when it comes to AI and learning is: can AI improve a student\u2019s chances of finding the right zone for learning? Let\u2019s start with Bloom\u2019s Taxonomy: \n\n[Image: Image of a slide with the question \"How might AI develop or deepen a student's ability to...\" above an image of Bloom's taxonomy rendered as a rainbow pyramid]\n\n1. AI can be a guide. AI can already perform many of the functions that a tutor or a skilled peer or a parent can when it comes to providing the guidance students need to find the right zone for learning. \n\n  * Remember: AI can assist a student in memorizing vocabulary or formulas by learning and presenting the information in a variety of formats.\n\n  * Understand: AI can assist a student with processing information by organizing or explaining it in different ways. \n\n  * Apply: AI can model a potential way to solve a problem in a way that allows the student to create their own solution and compare it to AI\u2019s.\n\n  * Analyze: AI can assist students with analysis by reviewing their work and asking follow-up questions.\n\n  * Evaluate: AI can assist students by generating alternative arguments or perspectives for the student to critique.\n\n  * Create: AI can assist students in creation by offering feedback and elaboration on their new ideas. \n\nWe are already \u30109\u2020seeing studies that suggest\u2020www.oneusefulthing.org\u3011 that using AI for complex knowledge work improves performance over not using it and is particularly effective at accelerating improvement for lower-level performers. Perhaps using AI knocks down some of the cognitive and emotional barriers that hold these performers back from learning deeply. Perhaps it offers assistance not previously accessible to them (like human tutors). Perhaps it smooths out the simpler or less important parts of the process to ensure they\u2019re fresh for complex tasks. The cause might not be clear, but the impact is already apparent: AI can help us work at all levels of Bloom\u2019s. \n\n2. Learning to use AI is itself a productive struggle. In his excellent newsletter \u201cIntentional Teaching\u201d (\u301010\u2020you can subscribe here\u2020derekbruff.org\u3011), Derek Bruff writes, \u201cSomething I've observed about the use of generative AI for hard tasks, at least so far, is that experts can coach an AI to produce expert-level work, but novices in a particular domain cannot\u2026As teachers our job is to help our students develop expertise whether or not those students use AI technologies along the way. The really interesting question for me is, where can generative AI help develop that expertise?\u201d\n\nI find it so much more compelling to consider how to design for expertise than for rigor. Learning how to use AI is challenging (in the good way) because of the critical thinking involved in analyzing responses, creating prompts, and understanding how to train AI through feedback and dialogue. Using it well also involves avoiding the negative effects of regular use (\u30109\u2020see the same study I cited above\u2020www.oneusefulthing.org\u3011) that can stifle critical thinking. Negotiating these differences requires guided practice. ",

I\u2019m not sure yet how often I\u2019ll post nor which topics I\u2019ll focus on, but I\u2019m working towards finding a cadence so that you\u2019ll know when to expect to hear from me. Thanks for bearing with me in these early days. \nL79: \nL80: One thing I DO know: I wanted to start by writing about generative artificial intelligence (AI). I have a few posts planned for the coming weeks, but don\u2019t worry, this won\u2019t be an AI-only newsletter.\nL81: \nL82: For me, the most important first step schools can take with AI is to help educators make sense of it.\nL83: \nL84: In the workshops I\u2019ve led on generative AI and assessment, and in the many conversations with schools I\u2019ve had over the months since ChatGPT made its debut last year, I\u2019ve found that educators, particularly teachers and staff who work directly with students, are experiencing a range of emotions about AI: skepticism, excitement, anxiety, resolve, and exhaustion. The sudden explosion of AI is just the most recent in a seemingly relentless string of challenges to the teaching profession since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic in 2020. \nL85: \nL86: I recently left a great job at \u30104\u2020a great organization\u2020globalonlineacademy.org\u3011 where I spent a decade working with teachers and administrators on using technology and learner-centered design to improve the student experience. For me, there are two essential elements to supporting educators in adapting to innovations in education: purpose and practice. We need to be clear about why an innovation is relevant to their work and to their students, and then we need to introduce some basic strategies that give them enough confidence to explore on their own. The goal is not to get educators to fall in love with an innovation, it\u2019s to help them make sense of it so they can make informed decisions on their own. \nL87: \nL88: In that spirit, below are questions, guidelines, and examples of ways I\u2019ve used AI myself and with educators in order to make sense of it.

For example, I was moved by \u30105\u2020this English teacher\u2019s reframing of AI\u2020www.nytimes.com\u3011 from \u201ccheating\u201d to \u201cassistance.\u201d I prefer these questions to the more general and more abstract (and very common) \u201cWhat should we do about AI?\u201d How we frame AI for ourselves as educators will affect how we frame it for our students, and I believe strongly that how we talk to students about AI will have a lasting impact on how they see its role in their own lives. \nL105: \nL106: ## Three Principles for Using AI\nL107: \nL108: Start with what you know. I was a middle and high school English teacher for 12 years, so most of my practice with AI has focused on things like grammar and essay writing and literary analysis. Why? Because I was in a position to assess the quality of AI\u2019s responses. My content knowledge has helped me craft prompts and follow-up questions to coach AI to produce better work. \nL109: \nL110: Focus on process, not product. We should be worried about artifacts of work that AI creates for us and for students, but we should be equally aware of how it can support our learning and work processes. Consider three areas: efficiency (can I get things done faster with AI?), effectiveness (can it make my work better?), and innovation (can it help me process and act on new ideas?). \nL111: \nL112: Prioritize dialogue over prompting. Not unlike those of human beings, AI\u2019s first attempts are rarely that great. Fortunately, it responds well to coaching and feedback. I am encouraging educators to spend less time trying to craft perfect initial prompts and instead engage AI in more sustained dialogue: ask it to do something, then nudge it and redirect it and correct it several times. Pay attention to how it learns what you want and then quickly improves its work in surprising ways.\nL113: \nL114: [Image]\nL115: \nL116: Midjourney: \u201ca laptop and an iphone and a notebook and an apple and a pencil on a wooden desk in the style of an oil still life\u201d\nL117: \nL118: ## Seven Things to Try\nL119: \nL120: For me, the best way to make sense of AI is to use it. These tools are powerful, but they are imperfect. They have enormous potentials and pitfalls for our world, but the tools available to most of us are accessible and easy to use. They are already doing amazingly sophisticated work in fields like medicine and technology and business, but they also have simple and practical applications in our day-to-day lives. \nL121: \nL122: Open up a chatbot like \u30106\u2020ChatGPT\u2020chat.openai.com\u3011 or \u30107\u2020Bing\u2020www.bing.com\u3011 or \u30108\u2020Bard\u2020bard.google.com\u3011 or \u30109\u2020Claude\u2020claude.ai\u3011 and give a few of the below ideas a try. All of these tools are free to use (sometimes with limits). Do this with colleagues! This kind of work is wonderful to do in groups, first because it\u2019s more fun and second because you can compare notes and share ideas in real time. It\u2019s a way to normalize open, collaborative exploration of AI.\nL123: \nL124: Create a Rubric. I have found AI chatbots to be particularly good at generating learning outcomes like competencies, standards, and performance levels for rubrics. Here\u2019s a prompt I used: \u201cGenerate a rubric in table format for the competency \u2018Communicate effectively with AI.\u2019 Include five sub-competencies. Articulate four performance levels for each subcompetency: novice, improving, mastering, and advanced.\u201d What would you ask AI to do after you saw this first attempt?\nL125: \nL126: [Image]\nL127: \nL128: (Re)design Feedback. Input into AI an example of written feedback you have given to a student or a colleague (with any personal or identifying information removed). Ask it to give you feedback on your feedback. Ask it to reformat the feedback from narrative to bullet points (or vice versa) in order to highlight key points. Ask it to rewrite the feedback (be warmer, be more direct, be more specific, etc.). Ask it to look for bias. Ask it to generate\nVisible: 0% - 49%",

For example, I was moved by \u30105\u2020this English teacher\u2019s reframing of AI\u2020www.nytimes.com\u3011 from \u201ccheating\u201d to \u201cassistance.\u201d I prefer these questions to the more general and more abstract (and very common) \u201cWhat should we do about AI?\u201d How we frame AI for ourselves as educators will affect how we frame it for our students, and I believe strongly that how we talk to students about AI will have a lasting impact on how they see its role in their own lives. \n\n## Three Principles for Using AI\n\nStart with what you know. I was a middle and high school English teacher for 12 years, so most of my practice with AI has focused on things like grammar and essay writing and literary analysis. Why? Because I was in a position to assess the quality of AI\u2019s responses. My content knowledge has helped me craft prompts and follow-up questions to coach AI to produce better work. \n\nFocus on process, not product. We should be worried about artifacts of work that AI creates for us and for students, but we should be equally aware of how it can support our learning and work processes. Consider three areas: efficiency (can I get things done faster with AI?), effectiveness (can it make my work better?), and innovation (can it help me process and act on new ideas?). \n\nPrioritize dialogue over prompting. Not unlike those of human beings, AI\u2019s first attempts are rarely that great. Fortunately, it responds well to coaching and feedback. I am encouraging educators to spend less time trying to craft perfect initial prompts and instead engage AI in more sustained dialogue: ask it to do something, then nudge it and redirect it and correct it several times. Pay attention to how it learns what you want and then quickly improves its work in surprising ways.\n\n[Image]\n\nMidjourney: \u201ca laptop and an iphone and a notebook and an apple and a pencil on a wooden desk in the style of an oil still life\u201d\n\n## Seven Things to Try\n\nFor me, the best way to make sense of AI is to use it. These tools are powerful, but they are imperfect. They have enormous potentials and pitfalls for our world, but the tools available to most of us are accessible and easy to use. They are already doing amazingly sophisticated work in fields like medicine and technology and business, but they also have simple and practical applications in our day-to-day lives. \n\nOpen up a chatbot like \u30106\u2020ChatGPT\u2020chat.openai.com\u3011 or \u30107\u2020Bing\u2020www.bing.com\u3011 or \u30108\u2020Bard\u2020bard.google.com\u3011 or \u30109\u2020Claude\u2020claude.ai\u3011 and give a few of the below ideas a try. All of these tools are free to use (sometimes with limits). Do this with colleagues! This kind of work is wonderful to do in groups, first because it\u2019s more fun and second because you can compare notes and share ideas in real time. It\u2019s a way to normalize open, collaborative exploration of AI.\n\nCreate a Rubric. I have found AI chatbots to be particularly good at generating learning outcomes like competencies, standards, and performance levels for rubrics. Here\u2019s a prompt I used: \u201cGenerate a rubric in table format for the competency \u2018Communicate effectively with AI.\u2019 Include five sub-competencies. Articulate four performance levels for each subcompetency: novice, improving, mastering, and advanced.\u201d What would you ask AI to do after you saw this first attempt?\n\n[Image]\n\n(Re)design Feedback. Input into AI an example of written feedback you have given to a student or a colleague (with any personal or identifying information removed). Ask it to give you feedback on your feedback. Ask it to reformat the feedback from narrative to bullet points (or vice versa) in order to highlight key points. Ask it to rewrite the feedback (be warmer, be more direct, be more specific, etc.). Ask it to look for bias. Ask it to generate follow-up questions the person receiving the feedback might have. Is it making your feedback better? Is the dialogue helping you think differently about your feedback?",

I\u2019m so glad you\u2019re here. \nL77: \nL78: I have a lot to learn and figure out as I get this going. I\u2019m not sure yet how often I\u2019ll post nor which topics I\u2019ll focus on, but I\u2019m working towards finding a cadence so that you\u2019ll know when to expect to hear from me. Thanks for bearing with me in these early days. \nL79: \nL80: One thing I DO know: I wanted to start by writing about generative artificial intelligence (AI). I have a few posts planned for the coming weeks, but don\u2019t worry, this won\u2019t be an AI-only newsletter.\nL81: \nL82: For me, the most important first step schools can take with AI is to help educators make sense of it.\nL83: \nL84: In the workshops I\u2019ve led on generative AI and assessment, and in the many conversations with schools I\u2019ve had over the months since ChatGPT made its debut last year, I\u2019ve found that educators, particularly teachers and staff who work directly with students, are experiencing a range of emotions about AI: skepticism, excitement, anxiety, resolve, and exhaustion. The sudden explosion of AI is just the most recent in a seemingly relentless string of challenges to the teaching profession since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic in 2020. \nL85: \nL86: I recently left a great job at a great organization where I spent a decade working with teachers and administrators on using technology and learner-centered design to improve the student experience. For me, there are two essential elements to supporting educators in adapting to innovations in education: purpose and practice. We need to be clear about why an innovation is relevant to their work and to their students, and then we need to introduce some basic strategies that give them enough confidence to explore on their own. The goal is not to get educators to fall in love with an innovation, it\u2019s to help them make sense of it so they can make informed decisions on their own. \nL87: \nL88: In that spirit, below are questions, guidelines, and examples of ways I\u2019ve used AI myself and with educators in order to make sense of it. This is by no means a comprehensive list: I would love for you to add your own ideas and suggestions in the comments. \nL89: \nL90: Thanks for reading Learning on Purpose!

                                    "text": "## Three Guiding Questions\n\nAfter months of thinking and talking about and trying AI, I keep coming back to three questions:\n\n  * What is our job as educators in a world being disrupted by AI?\n\n  * How might AI help students think more deeply?\n\n  * How might AI help educators become better designers and facilitators of learning experiences?\n\nHow we talk about AI matters. For example, I was moved by \u30105\u2020this English teacher\u2019s reframing of AI\u2020www.nytimes.com\u3011 from \u201ccheating\u201d to \u201cassistance.\u201d I prefer these questions to the more general and more abstract (and very common) \u201cWhat should we do about AI?\u201d How we frame AI for ourselves as educators will affect how we frame it for our students, and I believe strongly that how we talk to students about AI will have a lasting impact on how they see its role in their own lives. \n\n## Three Principles for Using AI\n\nStart with what you know. I was a middle and high school English teacher for 12 years, so most of my practice with AI has focused on things like grammar and essay writing and literary analysis. Why? Because I was in a position to assess the quality of AI\u2019s responses. My content knowledge has helped me craft prompts and follow-up questions to coach AI to produce better work. \n\nFocus on process, not product. We should be worried about artifacts of work that AI creates for us and for students, but we should be equally aware of how it can support our learning and work processes. Consider three areas: efficiency (can I get things done faster with AI?), effectiveness (can it make my work better?), and innovation (can it help me process and act on new ideas?). \n\nPrioritize dialogue over prompting. Not unlike those of human beings, AI\u2019s first attempts are rarely that great. Fortunately, it responds well to coaching and feedback. I am encouraging educators to spend less time trying to craft perfect initial prompts and instead engage AI in more sustained dialogue: ask it to do something, then nudge it and redirect it and correct it several times. Pay attention to how it learns what you want and then quickly improves its work in surprising ways.\n\n[Image]\n\nMidjourney: \u201ca laptop and an iphone and a notebook and an apple and a pencil on a wooden desk in the style of an oil still life\u201d\n\n## Seven Things to Try\n\nFor me, the best way to make sense of AI is to use it. These tools are powerful, but they are imperfect. They have enormous potentials and pitfalls for our world, but the tools available to most of us are accessible and easy to use. They are already doing amazingly sophisticated work in fields like medicine and technology and business, but they also have simple and practical applications in our day-to-day lives. \n\nOpen up a chatbot like \u30106\u2020ChatGPT\u2020chat.openai.com\u3011 or \u30107\u2020Bing\u2020www.bing.com\u3011 or \u30108\u2020Bard\u2020bard.google.com\u3011 or \u30109\u2020Claude\u2020claude.ai\u3011 and give a few of the below ideas a try. All of these tools are free to use (sometimes with limits). Do this with colleagues! This kind of work is wonderful to do in groups, first because it\u2019s more fun and second because you can compare notes and share ideas in real time. It\u2019s a way to normalize open, collaborative exploration of AI.\n\nCreate a Rubric. I have found AI chatbots to be particularly good at generating learning outcomes like competencies, standards, and performance levels for rubrics. Here\u2019s a prompt I used: \u201cGenerate a rubric in table format for the competency \u2018Communicate effectively with AI.\u2019 Include five sub-competencies. Articulate four performance levels for each subcompetency: novice, improving, mastering, and advanced.\u201d What would you ask AI to do after you saw this first attempt?\n\n[Image]\n\n(Re)design Feedback. Input into AI an example of written feedback you have given to a student or a colleague (with any personal or identifying information removed). Ask it to give you feedback on your feedback. Ask it to reformat the feedback from narrative to bullet points (or vice versa) in order to highlight key points. Ask it to rewrite the feedback (be warmer, be more direct, be more specific, etc.). Ask it to look for bias. Ask it to generate follow-up questions the person receiving the feedback might have. Is it making your feedback better? Is the dialogue helping you think differently about your feedback?",

Humans can read and write text. We can see images and watch videos. We listen to music to relax and watch out for strange noises to detect danger. Being able to work with multimodal data is essential for us or any AI to operate in the real world.\nL13: \nL14: OpenAI noted in their \u30106\u2020GPT-4V system card\u2020cdn.openai.com\u3011 that \u201cincorporating additional modalities (such as image inputs) into LLMs is viewed by some as a key frontier in AI research and development.\u201d\nL15: \nL16: Incorporating additional modalities to LLMs (Large Language Models) creates LMMs (Large Multimodal Models). In the last year, every week, a major research lab introduced a new LMM, e.g. DeepMind\u2019s Flamingo, Salesforce\u2019s BLIP, Microsoft\u2019s KOSMOS-1, Google\u2019s PaLM-E, and Tencent\u2019s Macaw-LLM. Chatbots like \u30107\u2020ChatGPT\u2020openai.com\u3011 and \u30108\u2020Gemini\u2020blog.google\u3011 are LMMs.\nL17: \nL18: Not all multimodal systems are LMMs. For example, text-to-image models like Midjourney, Stable Diffusion, and Dall-E are multimodal but don\u2019t have a language model component. Multimodal can mean one or more of the following:\nL19: \nL20:   1. Input and output are of different modalities (e.g. text-to-image, image-to-text)\nL21:   2. Inputs are multimodal (e.g. a system that can process both text and images)\nL22:   3. Outputs are multimodal (e.g. a system that can generate both text and images)\nL23: \nL24: This post covers multimodal systems in general, including LMMs. It consists of 3 parts.\nL25: \nL26:   * Part 1 covers the context for multimodality, including why multimodal, different data modalities, and types of multimodal tasks.\nL27:   * Part 2 discusses the fundamentals of a multimodal system, using the examples of CLIP, which lays the foundation for many future multimodal systems, and Flamingo, whose impressive performance gave rise to LMMs.\nL28:   * Part 3 discusses some active research areas for LMMs, including generating multimodal outputs and adapters for more efficient multimodal training, covering newer multimodal systems such as BLIP-2, LLaVA, LLaMA-Adapter V2, LAVIN, etc.\nL29: \nL30: The post is long. Feel free to skip to the sections most interesting to you.\nL31: \nL32: \u26a0 Ambiguous terminology \u26a0  \nL33: Multimodal data can also refer to multimodal distributions, e.g. bimodal distribution, which is different from multimodal data in this post.   \nL34: \nL35: * * *\nL36: \nL37: Table of contents  \nL38: \u30109\u2020Part 1.

Understanding Multimodal\nL67: \nL68: ## Why multimodal\nL69: \nL70: Many use cases are impossible without multimodality, especially those in industries that deal with a mixture of data modalities such as healthcare, robotics, e-commerce, retail, gaming, etc.\nL71: \nL72: [Image: Multimodal AI in healthcare]  An example of how multimodality can be used in healthcare. Image from Multimodal biomedical AI (Acosta et al., Nature Medicine 2022) \nL73: \nL74: Not only that, incorporating data from other modalities can help boost model performance. Shouldn\u2019t a model that can learn from both text and images perform better than a model that can learn from only text or only image?\nL75: \nL76: Multimodal systems can provide a more flexible interface, allowing you to interact with them in whichever way works best for you at the moment. Imagine you can ask a question by typing, talking, or just pointing your camera at something.\nL77: \nL78: One use case that I\u2019m especially excited about, is that multimodality can also enable visually impaired people to browse the Internet and also navigate the real world.\nL79: \nL80: [Image: Some cool multimodal use cases from GPT-4V]  Some cool multimodal use cases from GPT-4V \nL81: \nL82: ## Data modalities\nL83: \nL84: Different data modes are text, image, audio, tabular data, etc. One data mode can be represented or approximated in another data mode. For example:\nL85: \nL86:   * Audio can be represented as images (mel spectrograms).\nL87:   * Speech can be transcribed into text, though its text-only representation loses information such as volume, intonation, pauses, etc.\nL88:   * An image can be represented as a vector, which, in turn, can be flattened and represented as a sequence of text tokens.\nL89:   * A video is a sequence of images plus audio. ML models today mostly treat videos as sequences of images. This is a severe limitation, as sounds have proved to be just as important as visuals for videos. \u301034\u202088% of TikTok users shared that sound is essential for their TikTok experience\u2020www.kantar.com\u3011.\nL90:   * A text can be represented as an image if you simply take a picture of it.\nL91:   * A data table can be converted into a chart, which is an image.\nL92: \nL93: * * *\nL94: \nL95: How about other data modalities?  \nL96: \nL97: All digital data formats can be represented using bitstrings (strings of 0 and 1) or bytestrings. A model that can effectively learn from bitstrings or bytestrings will be very powerful, and it can learn from any data mode.  \nL98: \nL99: There are other data modalities we haven\u2019t touched on, such as graphs and 3D assets.

Humans can read and write text. We can see images and watch videos. We listen to music to relax and watch out for strange noises to detect danger. Being able to work with multimodal data is essential for us or any AI to operate in the real world.\nL13: \nL14: OpenAI noted in their GPT-4V system card that \u201cincorporating additional modalities (such as image inputs) into LLMs is viewed by some as a key frontier in AI research and development.\u201d\nL15: \nL16: Incorporating additional modalities to LLMs (Large Language Models) creates LMMs (Large Multimodal Models). In the last year, every week, a major research lab introduced a new LMM, e.g. DeepMind\u2019s Flamingo, Salesforce\u2019s BLIP, Microsoft\u2019s KOSMOS-1, Google\u2019s PaLM-E, and Tencent\u2019s Macaw-LLM. Chatbots like ChatGPT and Gemini are LMMs.\nL17: \nL18: Not all multimodal systems are LMMs. For example, text-to-image models like Midjourney, Stable Diffusion, and Dall-E are multimodal but don\u2019t have a language model component. Multimodal can mean one or more of the following:\nL19: \nL20:   1. Input and output are of different modalities (e.g. text-to-image, image-to-text)\nL21:   2. Inputs are multimodal (e.g. a system that can process both text and images)\nL22:   3.

Image from Multimodal biomedical AI (Acosta et al., Nature Medicine 2022) \nL73: \nL74: Not only that, incorporating data from other modalities can help boost model performance. Shouldn\u2019t a model that can learn from both text and images perform better than a model that can learn from only text or only image?\nL75: \nL76: Multimodal systems can provide a more flexible interface, allowing you to interact with them in whichever way works best for you at the moment. Imagine you can ask a question by typing, talking, or just pointing your camera at something.\nL77: \nL78: One use case that I\u2019m especially excited about, is that multimodality can also enable visually impaired people to browse the Internet and also navigate the real world.\nL79: \nL80: [Image: Some cool multimodal use cases from GPT-4V]  Some cool multimodal use cases from GPT-4V \nL81: \nL82: ## Data modalities\nL83: \nL84: Different data modes are text, image, audio, tabular data, etc. One data mode can be represented or approximated in another data mode. For example:\nL85: \nL86:   * Audio can be represented as images (mel spectrograms).\nL87:   * Speech can be transcribed into text, though its text-only representation loses information such as volume, intonation, pauses, etc.\nL88:   * An image can be represented as a vector, which, in turn, can be flattened and represented as a sequence of text tokens.\nL89:   * A video is a sequence of images plus audio. ML models today mostly treat videos as sequences of images. This is a severe limitation, as sounds have proved to be just as important as visuals for videos. 88% of TikTok users shared that sound is essential for their TikTok experience.\nL90:   * A text can be represented as an image if you simply take a picture of it.\nL91:   * A data table can be converted into a chart, which is an image.\nL92: \nL93: * * *\nL94: \nL95: How about other data modalities?  \nL96: \nL97: All digital data formats can be represented using bitstrings (strings of 0 and 1) or bytestrings. A model that can effectively learn from bitstrings or bytestrings will be very powerful, and it can learn from any data mode.  \nL98: \nL99: There are other data modalities we haven\u2019t touched on, such as graphs and 3D assets. We also haven\u2019t touched on the formats used to represent smell and touch (haptics).\nL100: \nL101: * * *\nL102: \nL103: In ML today, audio is still largely treated as a voice-based alternative to text.
