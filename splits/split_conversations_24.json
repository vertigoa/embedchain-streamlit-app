The amount of progress made in the assignment, i.e. how far did they get. 2. Time spent in the assignment working. \n\nStudents can get a high grade either by metric 1 or 2 or a combination of both. Some students finished the entire assignment an got to the end. Others did not get to the end but used all of their time working and making an effort. Students who did not get far and also did not put a lot of time in will get a lower grade.

                            "Sure, I can help you create a grading system based on the two metrics you've mentioned: progress made and time spent. \n\nLet's consider the following:\n\n1. **Progress made (P)**: This can be measured as a percentage, where 100% means the student completed the entire assignment, and 0% means they did not make any progress.\n\n2. **Time spent (T)**: This can also be measured as a percentage, where 100% means the student used all the time allocated for the assignment, and 0% means they did not spend any time.\n\nWe can create a weighted average of these two metrics to calculate the final grade. The weights can be adjusted based on how much importance you want to give to each metric. For example, if you want to give equal importance to both metrics, you can use a 50-50 weight. If you want to give more importance to progress made, you can use a 70-30 weight, and so on.\n\nHere's a simple formula for the final grade (G):\n\n$$\nG = w1*P + w2*T\n$$\n\nwhere:\n- G is the final grade\n- P is the progress made\n- T is the time spent\n- w1 and w2 are the weights for progress and time, respectively, such that w1 + w2 = 1\n\nYou can adjust the weights (w1 and w2) based on your preference. For example, if you want to give equal importance to both metrics, you can set w1 = 0.5 and w2 = 0.5. If you want to give more importance to progress, you can set w1 = 0.7 and w2 = 0.3, and so on.\n\nThis formula will give you a grade between 0 and 1. You can then multiply this by 100 to get a grade between 0 and 100, or you can convert it to a letter grade based on your grading scale.\n\nPlease note that this is a simple linear model and assumes that progress and time are equally valuable across their entire range. If you believe that the value of progress or time changes as they increase (for example, if the first 50% of progress is more valuable than the last 50%), you might want to consider a more complex model."

                            "Yes, the level of experience of the students in a class can certainly affect the distribution of grades. In classes with more experienced students, you might expect more students to complete the entire assignment, while in classes with more novice students, only a few might complete everything. This is something you might want to take into account when setting your grading scale.\n\nAs for determining a 'fair' average, one common approach is to use the median instead of the mean. The median is the middle value in a set of numbers, and it is less affected by outliers than the mean. So, you could calculate the median progress and time spent for each class and use these values as your benchmarks.\n\nHere's how you could adjust the grading formula to take these factors into account:\n\n1. **Normalize the progress and time spent**: Divide each student's progress and time spent by the median progress and time spent in their class, respectively. This will give you a number between 0 and 1 (or higher if a student exceeds the median), which represents how each student's progress and time spent compare to the median.\n\n2. **Adjust the weights based on the class level**: You could use different weights for the progress and time spent metrics depending on the level of the class. For example, in a class with more experienced students, you might give more weight to progress made, while in a class with more novice students, you might give more weight to time spent.\n\nHere's the adjusted formula:\n\n$$\nG = w1*(P/MedianP) + w2*(T/MedianT)\n$$\n\nwhere:\n- G is the final grade\n- P is the progress made\n- T is the time spent\n- MedianP is the median progress in the class\n- MedianT is the median time spent in the class\n- w1 and w2 are the weights for progress and time, respectively, such that w1 + w2 = 1\n\nAgain, you can adjust the weights (w1 and w2) based on the level of the class and your preference. This formula will give you a grade between 0 and 1 (or higher if a student exceeds the median). You can then multiply this by 100 to get a grade between 0 and 100, or you can convert it to a letter grade based on your grading scale.\n\nPlease note that this is still a relatively simple model and might not capture all the nuances of your grading situation. If you have more specific requirements or constraints, you might want to consider a more complex model or consult with a statistician or educational researcher."

                            "Sure, let's consider an example with a class of three students and an assignment that was supposed to take 60 minutes to complete.\n\n- Student A completed 80% of the assignment and spent 45 minutes.\n- Student B completed 60% of the assignment and spent 60 minutes.\n- Student C completed 40% of the assignment and spent 30 minutes.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the median progress and time spent in the class. In this case, the median progress is 60% (the progress of Student B), and the median time spent is 45 minutes (the time spent by Student A).\n\nNext, we normalize the progress and time spent for each student by dividing by the median. We also decide on the weights for progress and time spent. For this example, let's use equal weights of 0.5 for both.\n\nHere's how we calculate the grades:\n\n- Student A: \n  - Normalized progress = 80% / 60% = 1.33\n  - Normalized time = 45 minutes / 45 minutes = 1\n  - Grade = 0.5 * 1.33 + 0.5 * 1 = 1.17 (or 117 if we multiply by 100)\n\n- Student B: \n  - Normalized progress = 60% / 60% = 1\n  - Normalized time = 60 minutes / 45 minutes = 1.33\n  - Grade = 0.5 * 1 + 0.5 * 1.33 = 1.17 (or 117 if we multiply by 100)\n\n- Student C: \n  - Normalized progress = 40% / 60% = 0.67\n  - Normalized time = 30 minutes / 45 minutes = 0.67\n  - Grade = 0.5 * 0.67 + 0.5 * 0.67 = 0.67 (or 67 if we multiply by 100)\n\nAs you can see, Student A and B, who either completed more of the assignment or spent more time, received higher grades than Student C, who completed less and spent less time. \n\nPlease note that the grades are above 100 for Students A and B because they exceeded the median in either progress or time spent. If you want to cap the grades at 100, you could apply a min function to the final grade calculation:\n\n$$\nG = min(1, w1*(P/MedianP) + w2*(T/MedianT))\n$$\n\nThis will ensure that the grades are always between 0 and 1 (or 0 and 100 if multiplied by 100)."

                            "Microsoft offers several products and services that could be useful for this task:\n\n1. **Microsoft Excel**: This is a powerful spreadsheet program that can be used to store and analyze your student data. You can use Excel's built-in functions to calculate the median progress and time spent, normalize the progress and time spent for each student, and calculate the final grades based on the formula we discussed. Excel also offers data visualization tools that can help you understand the distribution of grades and identify any patterns or outliers.\n\n2. **Microsoft Power BI**: This is a business analytics tool that can be used to analyze data and share insights. You can import your student data into Power BI and create interactive dashboards that show the distribution of grades, the relationship between progress and time spent, and other key metrics. Power BI also supports more advanced statistical and predictive models, which could be useful if you want to explore more complex grading systems.\n\n3. **Microsoft Azure Machine Learning**: If you want to explore more complex grading systems that use machine learning or artificial intelligence, Azure Machine Learning could be a good option. This cloud-based service provides tools for training, deploying, and managing machine learning models. You could use it to train a model that predicts grades based on progress and time spent, and then use this model to grade new assignments.\n\n4. **Microsoft Forms**: If you're collecting student data through surveys or quizzes, Microsoft Forms could be a useful tool. You can create online forms, collect responses in real time, and export the results to Excel for analysis.\n\n5. **Microsoft Office 365 Education**: This suite of Microsoft products includes Excel, Power BI, and Forms, as well as other useful tools like Word (for creating assignments), PowerPoint (for lectures), and Teams (for communication and collaboration). If you're working in an educational setting, you might be able to get access to Office 365 Education for free.\n\nRemember, the best tool for you will depend on your specific needs, your comfort level with these tools, and the resources available to you."

The grades are between 0 and 1, with 1 representing the highest possible grade. If you prefer, you can multiply these grades by 100 to get a scale from 0 to 100.\n\nIn this calculation, the grades were determined based on both the student's progress and time spent, with more weight (70%) given to time spent and less weight (30%) given to progress. The progress and time spent were normalized to the maximum progress and time spent in the class, respectively. This means that a student who achieved the maximum progress or spent the maximum time would receive a grade of 1.00 for that factor."

The grades are between 0 and 1, with 1 representing the highest possible grade. If you prefer, you can multiply these grades by 100 to get a scale from 0 to 100.\n\nIn this calculation, the grades were determined based on both the student's progress and time spent, with more weight (70%) given to time spent and less weight (30%) given to progress. The progress and time spent were normalized to the maximum progress and time spent in the class, excluding the outlier student 6. This means that a student who achieved the maximum progress or spent the maximum time would receive a grade of 1.00 for that factor."

Let's try a different approach. \n\nWe can calculate the grades by comparing the student's progress and time spent to the maximum values in the class. If a student's progress is higher than their time spent, we'll give more weight to the progress. If a student's time spent is higher than their progress, we'll give more weight to the time spent. \n\nHere's the adjusted formula:\n\nIf \\( P_i > T_i \\):\n\\( G_i = w1 * \\frac{P_i}{P_{max}} + w2 * \\frac{T_i}{T_{max}} \\)\n\nIf \\( T_i > P_i \\):\n\\( G_i = w2 * \\frac{P_i}{P_{max}} + w1 * \\frac{T_i}{T_{max}} \\)\n\nwhere:\n- \\( G_i \\) is the grade for student i,\n- \\( P_i \\) is the progress of student i,\n- \\( T_i \\) is the time spent by student i,\n- \\( P_{max} \\) is the maximum progress in the class,\n- \\( T_{max} \\) is the maximum time spent in the class,\n- \\( w1 \\) is the weight for progress (0.7),\n- \\( w2 \\) is the weight for time spent (0.3).\n\nLet's calculate the grades using this formula."

                            "The fairness of a grading system can be subjective and depends on the specific goals of the course and the nature of the assignments. \n\nThe method we've discussed, which takes into account both the progress made by the student and the time they spent on the assignment, seems to be a balanced approach. It rewards both effort (time spent) and results (progress made). \n\nHowever, it's important to note a few things:\n\n1. This method assumes that spending more time on the assignment is always better. In some cases, you might want to reward efficiency (getting a lot done in a short amount of time) as well.\n\n2. Similarly, this method assumes that making more progress is always better. If the assignment is designed in such a way that rushing through it leads to lower quality work, you might want to adjust the weights accordingly.\n\n3. This method doesn't take into account the absolute level of progress or time spent. For example, a student who made very little progress and spent very little time would get the same grade as a student who made a lot of progress and spent a lot of time, as long as the ratio between progress and time spent is the same.\n\n4. Finally, this method doesn't consider other factors that might be important in your grading system, such as the quality of the work, the difficulty of the tasks completed, the student's improvement over time, etc.\n\nIn conclusion, while this method can be a good starting point, you might want to adjust it based on your specific needs and the nature of your course."

Let's try a different approach. \n\nWe can calculate the grades by comparing the student's progress and time spent to the maximum values in the class. If a student's progress is higher than their time spent, we'll give more weight to the progress. If a student's time spent is higher than their progress, we'll give more weight to the time spent. \n\nHere's the adjusted formula:\n\nIf \\( P_i > T_i \\):\n\\( G_i = w1 * \\frac{P_i}{P_{max}} + w2 * \\frac{T_i}{T_{max}} \\)\n\nIf \\( T_i > P_i \\):\n\\( G_i = w2 * \\frac{P_i}{P_{max}} + w1 * \\frac{T_i}{T_{max}} \\)\n\nwhere:\n- \\( G_i \\) is the grade for student i,\n- \\( P_i \\) is the progress of student i,\n- \\( T_i \\) is the time spent by student i,\n- \\( P_{max} \\) is the maximum progress in the class,\n- \\( T_{max} \\) is the maximum time spent in the class,\n- \\( w1 \\) is the weight for progress (0.7),\n- \\( w2 \\) is the weight for time spent (0.3).\n\nLet's calculate the grades using this formula."

Let's try a different approach. \n\nWe can calculate the grades by comparing the student's progress and time spent to the maximum values in the class. If a student's progress is higher than their time spent, we'll give more weight to the progress. If a student's time spent is higher than their progress, we'll give more weight to the time spent. \n\nHere's the adjusted formula:\n\nIf \\( P_i > T_i \\):\n\\( G_i = w1 * \\frac{P_i}{P_{max}} + w2 * \\frac{T_i}{T_{max}} \\)\n\nIf \\( T_i > P_i \\):\n\\( G_i = w2 * \\frac{P_i}{P_{max}} + w1 * \\frac{T_i}{T_{max}} \\)\n\nwhere:\n- \\( G_i \\) is the grade for student i,\n- \\( P_i \\) is the progress of student i,\n- \\( T_i \\) is the time spent by student i,\n- \\( P_{max} \\) is the maximum progress in the class,\n- \\( T_{max} \\) is the maximum time spent in the class,\n- \\( w1 \\) is the weight for progress (0.7),\n- \\( w2 \\) is the weight for time spent (0.3).\n\nLet's calculate the grades using this formula."

The grades are between 0 and 1, with 1 representing the highest possible grade. If you prefer, you can multiply these grades by 100 to get a scale from 0 to 100.\n\nIn this calculation, the grades were determined based on both the student's progress and time spent. If a student's progress was higher than their time spent, more weight (70%) was given to progress and less weight (30%) was given to time spent. If a student's time spent was higher than their progress, more weight (70%) was given to time spent and less weight (30%) was given to progress. The progress and time spent were normalized to the maximum progress and time spent in the class, respectively. This means that a student who achieved the maximum progress or spent the maximum time would receive a grade of 1.00 for that factor."

This means that a student's time spent was compared to the maximum time spent by any student, and a student's progress was compared to the maximum progress made by any student.\n\nThis approach ensures that the grades are calculated fairly, taking into account the relative effort and achievement of each student in terms of both time spent and progress made.\n\nHowever, if you would like to consider time spent in relation to progress made (or vice versa), we could adjust the calculation accordingly. For example, we could calculate a ratio of time spent to progress made for each student, and use this ratio to adjust the weights given to time spent and progress made in the grading formula. This would give more weight to whichever factor a student excelled in relative to the other. Please let me know if you would like to proceed with this approach."

The grades are between 0 and 1, with 1 representing the highest possible grade. If you prefer, you can multiply these grades by 100 to get a scale from 0 to 100.\n\nIn this calculation, the grades were determined based on both the student's progress and time spent. If a student's progress was higher than their time spent, more weight (70%) was given to progress and less weight (30%) was given to time spent. If a student's time spent was higher than their progress, more weight (70%) was given to time spent and less weight (30%) was given to progress. The progress and time spent were normalized to the maximum progress and time spent in the class, respectively. This means that a student who achieved the maximum progress or spent the maximum time would receive a grade of 1.00 for that factor."

The grades are between 0 and 1, with 1 representing the highest possible grade. If you prefer, you can multiply these grades by 100 to get a scale from 0 to 100.\n\nIn this calculation, the grades were determined based on both the student's progress and time spent. If a student's progress was higher than their time spent, more weight (70%) was given to progress and less weight (30%) was given to time spent. If a student's time spent was higher than their progress, more weight (70%) was given to time spent and less weight (30%) was given to progress. The progress and time spent were normalized to the maximum progress and time spent in the class, respectively. This means that a student who achieved the maximum progress or spent the maximum time would receive a grade of 1.00 for that factor."

In this post, we'll explore how you can leverage this powerful tool to help with everyday Excel usage and get answers to complex questions with ease.\n\n##  Getting Started With ChatGPT and Excel \n\n\u301056\u2020ChatGPT's many practical use cases\u3011 include its ability to provide real-time assistance and answer Excel-related queries instantly.\n\nWhile ChatGPT cannot be directly integrated with Excel as of now, it can still be a valuable tool to help you generate prompts and code examples for both everyday and complex Excel tasks. You can start by opening your Excel workbook in one window and going to \u301057\u2020ChatGPT webpage\u2020chat.openai.com\u3011 to chat with the bot.\n\nFor example, if you need help with a formula, type in something like \"Can you help me with a VLOOKUP formula?\" or \"What's the formula to calculate the average of a range of cells?\" and ChatGPT will respond. Similarly, if you need help with a specific macro, you can ask ChatGPT for assistance.\n\n##  Examples of Using ChatGPT With Excel \n\nTo get started, open a chat window with ChatGPT and ask for help. Here are some examples of how you can use ChatGPT to improve your Excel skills:\n\n  1. Formulas: To generate a formula that calculates the sum of a range of cells, ask ChatGPT with a prompt like \"What is the formula to calculate the sum of cells A1 to A10?\" or \"Can you help me with a formula that sums up the values in column B?\" \n  2. Macros: To create a macro that copies the contents of one cell to another, you can ask ChatGPT with a prompt like \"How can I create a macro that copies the value of cell A1 to cell B1?\" or \"What is the VBA code to copy a cell value to another cell?\" \n  3. Data Analysis: To generate a chart based on a range of data, you can ask ChatGPT with a prompt like \"What is the formula to create a chart based on these values xyz?\u201d or \"Can you help me create a chart that shows the trend of my sales data?\" \n\n##  ChatGPT Prompts and Code Examples for Excel \n\nHere are some examples of common ChatGPT prompts and code that can be useful while working with Excel.\n\n### 1. Rounding Numbers\n\nTo round a number to the nearest whole number, you can ask ChatGPT, \"What is the formula to round a number to the nearest whole number?\", and ChatGPT will respond with the formula \"=ROUND(A1,0)\".\n\n[Image: ChatGPT showing the formula to round a number to the nearest whole number on Excel] \n\n### 2. Calculating Averages\n\nTo calculate the average of a range of cells, you can ask ChatGPT, \"What is the formula to calculate the average of cells A1 to A10?\", and ChatGPT will respond with the formula \"=AVERAGE(A1:A10)\".\n\n[Image: ChatGPT showing the formula to calculate the average of cells on Excel] \n\n### 3. Sorting and Filtering Data\n\nYou can also use ChatGPT to create macros that sort and filter data. For example, you could ask, \"Can you create a macro that sorts data in ascending order?\", and ChatGPT will respond with the suitable VBA code:\n\n[Image: ChatGPT showing an example macro for the sort filter on Excel] \n\n### 4. More Advanced Examples\n\nYou can ask, \"Can you create a macro that filters data based on specific criteria?\", and ChatGPT will respond with the suitable macro code.\n\n[Image: ChatGPT showing the macro to create filters ] \n\nYou can ask \u201cCreate a macro that copies filtered data to a new worksheet\u201d, ChatGPT will respond with:\n\n[Image: ChatGPT showing the macro to copy filtered data to a new worksheet on Excel] \n\nIf you ask \u201cCalculate the weighted average of a range of cells\u201d, it will respond with:\n\n[Image: ChatGPT showing the formula for the SUMPRODUCT function for weighted average on Excel] \n\nAs you can see, ChatGPT can provide you with the prompts and code examples you need to use Excel more effectively. Just ask ChatGPT in plain English, and it will respond with the necessary information.\n\n##  The Best Practices of Using ChatGPT With Excel \n\nWhile ChatGPT can be a powerful tool for working with Excel, it's essential to use it correctly to get the best results. Here are some best practices for using ChatGPT with Excel.\n\n### 1. Use Clear and Concise Prompts\n\nWhen working with ChatGPT, it's essential to use clear and concise prompts that accurately convey your goal. A highly complex or convoluted prompt can hinder the bot\u2019s ability to provide accurate responses.\n\nFor instance, a prompt like \"Can you please tell me the average sales figures for the previous quarter, excluding sales from the southeast region, and sorted by date in descending order?\" might be too complicated for ChatGPT to parse and provide a meaningful response accurately.\n\n### 2. Double-Check the Generated Code\n\nChatGPT is an AI-based tool, and while it's usually very accurate, it's always a good idea to double-check the generated code to ensure it's doing what you want it to do. Test the generated code with sample data to ensure it's accurate and functioning as expected.\n\nWhen using ChatGPT to generate a macro, review the code carefully and check for syntax errors or logical inconsistencies. Testing the macro with sample data can also help ensure it functions as expected.\n\n### 3. Start With More Straightforward Problems\n\nIf you're new to using ChatGPT with Excel, starting with more specific and straightforward issues is a good idea to understand how the tool works.

In this post, we'll explore how you can leverage this powerful tool to help with everyday Excel usage and get answers to complex questions with ease.\n\n##  Getting Started With ChatGPT and Excel \n\nChatGPT's many practical use cases include its ability to provide real-time assistance and answer Excel-related queries instantly.\n\nWhile ChatGPT cannot be directly integrated with Excel as of now, it can still be a valuable tool to help you generate prompts and code examples for both everyday and complex Excel tasks. You can start by opening your Excel workbook in one window and going to ChatGPT webpage to chat with the bot.\n\nFor example, if you need help with a formula, type in something like \"Can you help me with a VLOOKUP formula?\" or \"What's the formula to calculate the average of a range of cells?\" and ChatGPT will respond. Similarly, if you need help with a specific macro, you can ask ChatGPT for assistance.\n\n##  Examples of Using ChatGPT With Excel \n\nTo get started, open a chat window with ChatGPT and ask for help. Here are some examples of how you can use ChatGPT to improve your Excel skills:\n\n  1. Formulas: To generate a formula that calculates the sum of a range of cells, ask ChatGPT with a prompt like \"What is the formula to calculate the sum of cells A1 to A10?\" or \"Can you help me with a formula that sums up the values in column B?\" \n  2. Macros: To create a macro that copies the contents of one cell to another, you can ask ChatGPT with a prompt like \"How can I create a macro that copies the value of cell A1 to cell B1?\" or \"What is the VBA code to copy a cell value to another cell?\" \n  3. Data Analysis: To generate a chart based on a range of data, you can ask ChatGPT with a prompt like \"What is the formula to create a chart based on these values xyz?\u201d or \"Can you help me create a chart that shows the trend of my sales data?\" \n\n##  ChatGPT Prompts and Code Examples for Excel \n\nHere are some examples of common ChatGPT prompts and code that can be useful while working with Excel.\n\n### 1. Rounding Numbers\n\nTo round a number to the nearest whole number, you can ask ChatGPT, \"What is the formula to round a number to the nearest whole number?\", and ChatGPT will respond with the formula \"=ROUND(A1,0)\".\n\n[Image: ChatGPT showing the formula to round a number to the nearest whole number on Excel] \n\n### 2. Calculating Averages\n\nTo calculate the average of a range of cells, you can ask ChatGPT, \"What is the formula to calculate the average of cells A1 to A10?\", and ChatGPT will respond with the formula \"=AVERAGE(A1:A10)\".\n\n[Image: ChatGPT showing the formula to calculate the average of cells on Excel] \n\n### 3. Sorting and Filtering Data\n\nYou can also use ChatGPT to create macros that sort and filter data. For example, you could ask, \"Can you create a macro that sorts data in ascending order?\", and ChatGPT will respond with the suitable VBA code:\n\n[Image: ChatGPT showing an example macro for the sort filter on Excel] \n\n### 4. More Advanced Examples\n\nYou can ask, \"Can you create a macro that filters data based on specific criteria?\", and ChatGPT will respond with the suitable macro code.\n\n[Image: ChatGPT showing the macro to create filters ] \n\nYou can ask \u201cCreate a macro that copies filtered data to a new worksheet\u201d, ChatGPT will respond with:\n\n[Image: ChatGPT showing the macro to copy filtered data to a new worksheet on Excel] \n\nIf you ask \u201cCalculate the weighted average of a range of cells\u201d, it will respond with:\n\n[Image: ChatGPT showing the formula for the SUMPRODUCT function for weighted average on Excel] \n\nAs you can see, ChatGPT can provide you with the prompts and code examples you need to use Excel more effectively. Just ask ChatGPT in plain English, and it will respond with the necessary information.\n\n##  The Best Practices of Using ChatGPT With Excel \n\nWhile ChatGPT can be a powerful tool for working with Excel, it's essential to use it correctly to get the best results. Here are some best practices for using ChatGPT with Excel.\n\n### 1. Use Clear and Concise Prompts\n\nWhen working with ChatGPT, it's essential to use clear and concise prompts that accurately convey your goal. A highly complex or convoluted prompt can hinder the bot\u2019s ability to provide accurate responses.\n\nFor instance, a prompt like \"Can you please tell me the average sales figures for the previous quarter, excluding sales from the southeast region, and sorted by date in descending order?\" might be too complicated for ChatGPT to parse and provide a meaningful response accurately.\n\n### 2. Double-Check the Generated Code\n\nChatGPT is an AI-based tool, and while it's usually very accurate, it's always a good idea to double-check the generated code to ensure it's doing what you want it to do. Test the generated code with sample data to ensure it's accurate and functioning as expected.\n\nWhen using ChatGPT to generate a macro, review the code carefully and check for syntax errors or logical inconsistencies. Testing the macro with sample data can also help ensure it functions as expected.\n\n### 3. Start With More Straightforward Problems\n\nIf you're new to using ChatGPT with Excel, starting with more specific and straightforward issues is a good idea to understand how the tool works. For example, you can begin by asking for formulas to sort and filter data in Excel or create a pivot table.\n\nAs you become more comfortable using ChatGPT with Excel, you can move on to more complex problems, such as creating custom functions or automating repetitive tasks with macros.\n\n##  Make the Best of ChatGPT and Excel \n\nWhether you're a data analyst, financial professional, business owner, or just someone looking to save time with your spreadsheets, ChatGPT and Excel can help you gain valuable insights and make informed decisions based on your data.\n\nWith the resources provided above, you can continue developing your skills and exploring this powerful integration's full potential.

Just ask ChatGPT in plain English, and it will respond with the necessary information.\n\n##  The Best Practices of Using ChatGPT With Excel \n\nWhile ChatGPT can be a powerful tool for working with Excel, it's essential to use it correctly to get the best results. Here are some best practices for using ChatGPT with Excel.\n\n### 1. Use Clear and Concise Prompts\n\nWhen working with ChatGPT, it's essential to use clear and concise prompts that accurately convey your goal. A highly complex or convoluted prompt can hinder the bot\u2019s ability to provide accurate responses.\n\nFor instance, a prompt like \"Can you please tell me the average sales figures for the previous quarter, excluding sales from the southeast region, and sorted by date in descending order?\" might be too complicated for ChatGPT to parse and provide a meaningful response accurately.\n\n### 2. Double-Check the Generated Code\n\nChatGPT is an AI-based tool, and while it's usually very accurate, it's always a good idea to double-check the generated code to ensure it's doing what you want it to do. Test the generated code with sample data to ensure it's accurate and functioning as expected.\n\nWhen using ChatGPT to generate a macro, review the code carefully and check for syntax errors or logical inconsistencies. Testing the macro with sample data can also help ensure it functions as expected.\n\n### 3. Start With More Straightforward Problems\n\nIf you're new to using ChatGPT with Excel, starting with more specific and straightforward issues is a good idea to understand how the tool works. For example, you can begin by asking for formulas to sort and filter data in Excel or create a pivot table.\n\nAs you become more comfortable using ChatGPT with Excel, you can move on to more complex problems, such as creating custom functions or automating repetitive tasks with macros.\n\n##  Make the Best of ChatGPT and Excel \n\nWhether you're a data analyst, financial professional, business owner, or just someone looking to save time with your spreadsheets, ChatGPT and Excel can help you gain valuable insights and make informed decisions based on your data.\n\nWith the resources provided above, you can continue developing your skills and exploring this powerful integration's full potential. You might be able to create an Excel template of your own! So what are you waiting for?

You can start by opening your Excel workbook in one window and going to ChatGPT webpage to chat with the bot.\n\nFor example, if you need help with a formula, type in something like \"Can you help me with a VLOOKUP formula?\" or \"What's the formula to calculate the average of a range of cells?\" and ChatGPT will respond. Similarly, if you need help with a specific macro, you can ask ChatGPT for assistance.\n\n##  Examples of Using ChatGPT With Excel \n\nTo get started, open a chat window with ChatGPT and ask for help. Here are some examples of how you can use ChatGPT to improve your Excel skills:\n\n  1. Formulas: To generate a formula that calculates the sum of a range of cells, ask ChatGPT with a prompt like \"What is the formula to calculate the sum of cells A1 to A10?\" or \"Can you help me with a formula that sums up the values in column B?\" \n  2. Macros: To create a macro that copies the contents of one cell to another, you can ask ChatGPT with a prompt like \"How can I create a macro that copies the value of cell A1 to cell B1?\" or \"What is the VBA code to copy a cell value to another cell?\" \n  3. Data Analysis: To generate a chart based on a range of data, you can ask ChatGPT with a prompt like \"What is the formula to create a chart based on these values xyz?\u201d or \"Can you help me create a chart that shows the trend of my sales data?\" \n\n##  ChatGPT Prompts and Code Examples for Excel \n\nHere are some examples of common ChatGPT prompts and code that can be useful while working with Excel.\n\n### 1. Rounding Numbers\n\nTo round a number to the nearest whole number, you can ask ChatGPT, \"What is the formula to round a number to the nearest whole number?\", and ChatGPT will respond with the formula \"=ROUND(A1,0)\".\n\n[Image: ChatGPT showing the formula to round a number to the nearest whole number on Excel] \n\n### 2. Calculating Averages\n\nTo calculate the average of a range of cells, you can ask ChatGPT, \"What is the formula to calculate the average of cells A1 to A10?\", and ChatGPT will respond with the formula \"=AVERAGE(A1:A10)\".\n\n[Image: ChatGPT showing the formula to calculate the average of cells on Excel] \n\n### 3. Sorting and Filtering Data\n\nYou can also use ChatGPT to create macros that sort and filter data. For example, you could ask, \"Can you create a macro that sorts data in ascending order?\", and ChatGPT will respond with the suitable VBA code:\n\n[Image: ChatGPT showing an example macro for the sort filter on Excel] \n\n### 4. More Advanced Examples\n\nYou can ask, \"Can you create a macro that filters data based on specific criteria?\", and ChatGPT will respond with the suitable macro code.\n\n[Image: ChatGPT showing the macro to create filters ] \n\nYou can ask \u201cCreate a macro that copies filtered data to a new worksheet\u201d, ChatGPT will respond with:\n\n[Image: ChatGPT showing the macro to copy filtered data to a new worksheet on Excel] \n\nIf you ask \u201cCalculate the weighted average of a range of cells\u201d, it will respond with:\n\n[Image: ChatGPT showing the formula for the SUMPRODUCT function for weighted average on Excel] \n\nAs you can see, ChatGPT can provide you with the prompts and code examples you need to use Excel more effectively. Just ask ChatGPT in plain English, and it will respond with the necessary information.\n\n##  The Best Practices of Using ChatGPT With Excel \n\nWhile ChatGPT can be a powerful tool for working with Excel, it's essential to use it correctly to get the best results. Here are some best practices for using ChatGPT with Excel.\n\n### 1. Use Clear and Concise Prompts\n\nWhen working with ChatGPT, it's essential to use clear and concise prompts that accurately convey your goal. A highly complex or convoluted prompt can hinder the bot\u2019s ability to provide accurate responses.\n\nFor instance, a prompt like \"Can you please tell me the average sales figures for the previous quarter, excluding sales from the southeast region, and sorted by date in descending order?\" might be too complicated for ChatGPT to parse and provide a meaningful response accurately.\n\n### 2. Double-Check the Generated Code\n\nChatGPT is an AI-based tool, and while it's usually very accurate, it's always a good idea to double-check the generated code to ensure it's doing what you want it to do. Test the generated code with sample data to ensure it's accurate and functioning as expected.\n\nWhen using ChatGPT to generate a macro, review the code carefully and check for syntax errors or logical inconsistencies. Testing the macro with sample data can also help ensure it functions as expected.\n\n### 3. Start With More Straightforward Problems\n\nIf you're new to using ChatGPT with Excel, starting with more specific and straightforward issues is a good idea to understand how the tool works. For example, you can begin by asking for formulas to sort and filter data in Excel or create a pivot table.\n\nAs you become more comfortable using ChatGPT with Excel, you can move on to more complex problems, such as creating custom functions or automating repetitive tasks with macros.\n\n##  Make the Best of ChatGPT and Excel \n\nWhether you're a data analyst, financial professional, business owner, or just someone looking to save time with your spreadsheets, ChatGPT and Excel can help you gain valuable insights and make informed decisions based on your data.\n\nWith the resources provided above, you can continue developing your skills and exploring this powerful integration's full potential. You might be able to create an Excel template of your own! So what are you waiting for?

A highly complex or convoluted prompt can hinder the bot\u2019s ability to provide accurate responses.\n\nFor instance, a prompt like \"Can you please tell me the average sales figures for the previous quarter, excluding sales from the southeast region, and sorted by date in descending order?\" might be too complicated for ChatGPT to parse and provide a meaningful response accurately.\n\n### 2. Double-Check the Generated Code\n\nChatGPT is an AI-based tool, and while it's usually very accurate, it's always a good idea to double-check the generated code to ensure it's doing what you want it to do. Test the generated code with sample data to ensure it's accurate and functioning as expected.\n\nWhen using ChatGPT to generate a macro, review the code carefully and check for syntax errors or logical inconsistencies. Testing the macro with sample data can also help ensure it functions as expected.\n\n### 3. Start With More Straightforward Problems\n\nIf you're new to using ChatGPT with Excel, starting with more specific and straightforward issues is a good idea to understand how the tool works. For example, you can begin by asking for formulas to sort and filter data in Excel or create a pivot table.\n\nAs you become more comfortable using ChatGPT with Excel, you can move on to more complex problems, such as creating custom functions or automating repetitive tasks with macros",

The only information they can learn from is their training data. This information can be out-of-date and is one-size fits all across applications. Furthermore, the only thing language models can do out-of-the-box is emit text. This text can contain useful instructions, but to actually follow these instructions you need another process.\n\nThough not a perfect analogy, plugins can be \u201ceyes and ears\u201d for language models, giving them access to information that is too recent, too personal, or too specific to be included in the training data. In response to a user\u2019s explicit request, plugins can also enable language models to perform safe, constrained actions on their behalf, increasing the usefulness of the system overall.\n\nWe expect that open standards will emerge to unify the ways in which applications expose an AI-facing interface. We are working on an early attempt at what such a standard might look like, and we\u2019re looking for feedback from developers interested in building with us.\n\nToday, we\u2019re beginning to gradually enable existing plugins from our early collaborators for ChatGPT users, beginning with ChatGPT Plus subscribers. We\u2019re also beginning to roll out the ability for developers to create their own plugins for ChatGPT.\n\nIn the coming months, as we learn from deployment and continue to improve our safety systems, we\u2019ll iterate on this protocol, and we plan to enable developers using OpenAI models to integrate plugins into their own applications beyond ChatGPT.  \n\n## Safety and broader implications \n\nConnecting language models to external tools introduces new opportunities as well as significant \u301051\u2020new risks\u2020cdn.openai.com\u3011.\n\nPlugins offer the potential to tackle various challenges associated with large language models, including \u201challucinations,\u201d keeping up with recent events, and accessing (with permission) proprietary information sources. By integrating explicit access to external data\u2014such as up-to-date information online, code-based calculations, or custom plugin-retrieved information\u2014language models can strengthen their responses with evidence-based references.\n\nThese references not only enhance the model\u2019s utility but also enable users to assess the trustworthiness of the model\u2019s output and double-check its accuracy, potentially mitigating risks related to overreliance as discussed in our recent GPT-4 \u301051\u2020system card\u2020cdn.openai.com\u3011. Lastly, the value of plugins may go well beyond addressing existing limitations by helping users with a variety of new use cases, ranging from browsing product catalogs to booking flights or ordering food.\n\nAt the same time, there\u2019s a risk that plugins could increase safety challenges by taking harmful or unintended actions, increasing the capabilities of bad actors who would defraud, mislead, or abuse others. By increasing the range of possible applications, plugins may raise the risk of negative consequences from mistaken or misaligned actions taken by the model in new domains. From day one, these factors have guided the development of our plugin platform, and we have implemented several safeguards.\n\n> From day one, these factors have guided the development of our plugin platform, and we have implemented several safeguards.\n\nWe\u2019ve performed red-teaming exercises, both internally and with external collaborators, that have revealed a number of possible concerning scenarios. For example, our red teamers discovered ways for plugins\u2014if released without safeguards\u2014to perform sophisticated prompt injection, send fraudulent and spam emails, bypass safety restrictions, or misuse information sent to the plugin. We\u2019re using these findings to inform safety-by-design mitigations that restrict risky plugin behaviors and improve transparency of how and when they're operating as part of the user experience.

The only information they can learn from is their training data. This information can be out-of-date and is one-size fits all across applications. Furthermore, the only thing language models can do out-of-the-box is emit text. This text can contain useful instructions, but to actually follow these instructions you need another process.\n\nThough not a perfect analogy, plugins can be \u201ceyes and ears\u201d for language models, giving them access to information that is too recent, too personal, or too specific to be included in the training data. In response to a user\u2019s explicit request, plugins can also enable language models to perform safe, constrained actions on their behalf, increasing the usefulness of the system overall.\n\nWe expect that open standards will emerge to unify the ways in which applications expose an AI-facing interface. We are working on an early attempt at what such a standard might look like, and we\u2019re looking for feedback from developers interested in building with us.\n\nToday, we\u2019re beginning to gradually enable existing plugins from our early collaborators for ChatGPT users, beginning with ChatGPT Plus subscribers. We\u2019re also beginning to roll out the ability for developers to create their own plugins for ChatGPT.\n\nIn the coming months, as we learn from deployment and continue to improve our safety systems, we\u2019ll iterate on this protocol, and we plan to enable developers using OpenAI models to integrate plugins into their own applications beyond ChatGPT.  \n\n## Safety and broader implications \n\nConnecting language models to external tools introduces new opportunities as well as significant \u301051\u2020new risks\u2020cdn.openai.com\u3011.\n\nPlugins offer the potential to tackle various challenges associated with large language models, including \u201challucinations,\u201d keeping up with recent events, and accessing (with permission) proprietary information sources. By integrating explicit access to external data\u2014such as up-to-date information online, code-based calculations, or custom plugin-retrieved information\u2014language models can strengthen their responses with evidence-based references.\n\nThese references not only enhance the model\u2019s utility but also enable users to assess the trustworthiness of the model\u2019s output and double-check its accuracy, potentially mitigating risks related to overreliance as discussed in our recent GPT-4 \u301051\u2020system card\u2020cdn.openai.com\u3011. Lastly, the value of plugins may go well beyond addressing existing limitations by helping users with a variety of new use cases, ranging from browsing product catalogs to booking flights or ordering food.\n\nAt the same time, there\u2019s a risk that plugins could increase safety challenges by taking harmful or unintended actions, increasing the capabilities of bad actors who would defraud, mislead, or abuse others. By increasing the range of possible applications, plugins may raise the risk of negative consequences from mistaken or misaligned actions taken by the model in new domains. From day one, these factors have guided the development of our plugin platform, and we have implemented several safeguards.\n\n> From day one, these factors have guided the development of our plugin platform, and we have implemented several safeguards.\n\nWe\u2019ve performed red-teaming exercises, both internally and with external collaborators, that have revealed a number of possible concerning scenarios. For example, our red teamers discovered ways for plugins\u2014if released without safeguards\u2014to perform sophisticated prompt injection, send fraudulent and spam emails, bypass safety restrictions, or misuse information sent to the plugin. We\u2019re using these findings to inform safety-by-design mitigations that restrict risky plugin behaviors and improve transparency of how and when they're operating as part of the user experience. We're also using these findings to inform our decision to gradually deploy access to plugins.\n\nIf you\u2019re a researcher interested in studying safety risks or mitigations in this area, we encourage you to make use of our \u301052\u2020Researcher Access Program\u3011. We also invite developers and researchers to submit plugin-related safety and capability evaluations as part of our recently open-sourced \u301053\u2020Evals framework\u2020github.com\u3011.\n\nPlugins will likely have wide-ranging societal implications. For example, we recently released a \u301054\u2020working paper\u2020arxiv.org\u3011 which found that language models with access to tools will likely have much greater economic impacts than those without, and more generally, in line with \u301055\u2020other\u2020papers.ssrn.com\u3011 \u301056\u2020researchers\u2019\u2020arxiv.org\u3011 findings, we expect the current wave of AI technologies to have a big effect on the pace of job transformation, displacement, and creation. We are eager to collaborate with external \u301057\u2020researchers\u2020share.hsforms.com\u3011 and our \u301058\u2020customers\u2020share.hsforms.com\u3011 to study these impacts.  \n\n## Browsing \n\nAlpha \n\nAn experimental model that knows when and how to browse the internet \n\nMotivated by past work (our own \u301059\u2020WebGPT\u3011, as well as \u301060\u2020GopherCite\u2020arxiv.org\u3011, \u301061\u2020BlenderBot2\u2020parl.ai\u3011, \u301062\u2020LaMDA2\u2020ai.googleblog.com\u3011 and \u301063\u2020others\u2020arxiv.org\u3011), allowing language models to read information from the internet strictly expands the amount of content they can discuss, going beyond the training corpus to fresh information from the present day.\n\nHere\u2019s an example of the kind of experience that browsing opens up to ChatGPT users, that previously would have had the model politely point out that its training data didn\u2019t include enough information to let it answer.

The only information they can learn from is their training data. This information can be out-of-date and is one-size fits all across applications. Furthermore, the only thing language models can do out-of-the-box is emit text. This text can contain useful instructions, but to actually follow these instructions you need another process.\n\nThough not a perfect analogy, plugins can be \u201ceyes and ears\u201d for language models, giving them access to information that is too recent, too personal, or too specific to be included in the training data. In response to a user\u2019s explicit request, plugins can also enable language models to perform safe, constrained actions on their behalf, increasing the usefulness of the system overall.\n\nWe expect that open standards will emerge to unify the ways in which applications expose an AI-facing interface. We are working on an early attempt at what such a standard might look like, and we\u2019re looking for feedback from developers interested in building with us.\n\nToday, we\u2019re beginning to gradually enable existing plugins from our early collaborators for ChatGPT users, beginning with ChatGPT Plus subscribers. We\u2019re also beginning to roll out the ability for developers to create their own plugins for ChatGPT.\n\nIn the coming months, as we learn from deployment and continue to improve our safety systems, we\u2019ll iterate on this protocol, and we plan to enable developers using OpenAI models to integrate plugins into their own applications beyond ChatGPT.  \n\n## Safety and broader implications \n\nConnecting language models to external tools introduces new opportunities as well as significant \u301051\u2020new risks\u2020cdn.openai.com\u3011.\n\nPlugins offer the potential to tackle various challenges associated with large language models, including \u201challucinations,\u201d keeping up with recent events, and accessing (with permission) proprietary information sources. By integrating explicit access to external data\u2014such as up-to-date information online, code-based calculations, or custom plugin-retrieved information\u2014language models can strengthen their responses with evidence-based references.\n\nThese references not only enhance the model\u2019s utility but also enable users to assess the trustworthiness of the model\u2019s output and double-check its accuracy, potentially mitigating risks related to overreliance as discussed in our recent GPT-4 \u301051\u2020system card\u2020cdn.openai.com\u3011. Lastly, the value of plugins may go well beyond addressing existing limitations by helping users with a variety of new use cases, ranging from browsing product catalogs to booking flights or ordering food.\n\nAt the same time, there\u2019s a risk that plugins could increase safety challenges by taking harmful or unintended actions, increasing the capabilities of bad actors who would defraud, mislead, or abuse others. By increasing the range of possible applications, plugins may raise the risk of negative consequences from mistaken or misaligned actions taken by the model in new domains. From day one, these factors have guided the development of our plugin platform, and we have implemented several safeguards.\n\n> From day one, these factors have guided the development of our plugin platform, and we have implemented several safeguards.\n\nWe\u2019ve performed red-teaming exercises, both internally and with external collaborators, that have revealed a number of possible concerning scenarios. For example, our red teamers discovered ways for plugins\u2014if released without safeguards\u2014to perform sophisticated prompt injection, send fraudulent and spam emails, bypass safety restrictions, or misuse information sent to the plugin. We\u2019re using these findings to inform safety-by-design mitigations that restrict risky plugin behaviors and improve transparency of how and when they're operating as part of the user experience. We're also using these findings to inform our decision to gradually deploy access to plugins.\n\nIf you\u2019re a researcher interested in studying safety risks or mitigations in this area, we encourage you to make use of our \u301052\u2020Researcher Access Program\u3011. We also invite developers and researchers to submit plugin-related safety and capability evaluations as part of our recently open-sourced \u301053\u2020Evals framework\u2020github.com\u3011.\n\nPlugins will likely have wide-ranging societal implications. For example, we recently released a \u301054\u2020working paper\u2020arxiv.org\u3011 which found that language models with access to tools will likely have much greater economic impacts than those without, and more generally, in line with \u301055\u2020other\u2020papers.ssrn.com\u3011 \u301056\u2020researchers\u2019\u2020arxiv.org\u3011 findings, we expect the current wave of AI technologies to have a big effect on the pace of job transformation, displacement, and creation. We are eager to collaborate with external \u301057\u2020researchers\u2020share.hsforms.com\u3011 and our \u301058\u2020customers\u2020share.hsforms.com\u3011 to study these impacts.  \n\n## Browsing \n\nAlpha \n\nAn experimental model that knows when and how to browse the internet \n\nMotivated by past work (our own \u301059\u2020WebGPT\u3011, as well as \u301060\u2020GopherCite\u2020arxiv.org\u3011, \u301061\u2020BlenderBot2\u2020parl.ai\u3011, \u301062\u2020LaMDA2\u2020ai.googleblog.com\u3011 and \u301063\u2020others\u2020arxiv.org\u3011), allowing language models to read information from the internet strictly expands the amount of content they can discuss, going beyond the training corpus to fresh information from the present day.\n\nHere\u2019s an example of the kind of experience that browsing opens up to ChatGPT users, that previously would have had the model politely point out that its training data didn\u2019t include enough information to let it answer.

The only information they can learn from is their training data. This information can be out-of-date and is one-size fits all across applications. Furthermore, the only thing language models can do out-of-the-box is emit text. This text can contain useful instructions, but to actually follow these instructions you need another process.\n\nThough not a perfect analogy, plugins can be \u201ceyes and ears\u201d for language models, giving them access to information that is too recent, too personal, or too specific to be included in the training data. In response to a user\u2019s explicit request, plugins can also enable language models to perform safe, constrained actions on their behalf, increasing the usefulness of the system overall.\n\nWe expect that open standards will emerge to unify the ways in which applications expose an AI-facing interface. We are working on an early attempt at what such a standard might look like, and we\u2019re looking for feedback from developers interested in building with us.\n\nToday, we\u2019re beginning to gradually enable existing plugins from our early collaborators for ChatGPT users, beginning with ChatGPT Plus subscribers. We\u2019re also beginning to roll out the ability for developers to create their own plugins for ChatGPT.\n\nIn the coming months, as we learn from deployment and continue to improve our safety systems, we\u2019ll iterate on this protocol, and we plan to enable developers using OpenAI models to integrate plugins into their own applications beyond ChatGPT.  \n\n## Safety and broader implications \n\nConnecting language models to external tools introduces new opportunities as well as significant \u301051\u2020new risks\u2020cdn.openai.com\u3011.\n\nPlugins offer the potential to tackle various challenges associated with large language models, including \u201challucinations,\u201d keeping up with recent events, and accessing (with permission) proprietary information sources. By integrating explicit access to external data\u2014such as up-to-date information online, code-based calculations, or custom plugin-retrieved information\u2014language models can strengthen their responses with evidence-based references.\n\nThese references not only enhance the model\u2019s utility but also enable users to assess the trustworthiness of the model\u2019s output and double-check its accuracy, potentially mitigating risks related to overreliance as discussed in our recent GPT-4 \u301051\u2020system card\u2020cdn.openai.com\u3011. Lastly, the value of plugins may go well beyond addressing existing limitations by helping users with a variety of new use cases, ranging from browsing product catalogs to booking flights or ordering food.\n\nAt the same time, there\u2019s a risk that plugins could increase safety challenges by taking harmful or unintended actions, increasing the capabilities of bad actors who would defraud, mislead, or abuse others. By increasing the range of possible applications, plugins may raise the risk of negative consequences from mistaken or misaligned actions taken by the model in new domains. From day one, these factors have guided the development of our plugin platform, and we have implemented several safeguards.\n\n> From day one, these factors have guided the development of our plugin platform, and we have implemented several safeguards.\n\nWe\u2019ve performed red-teaming exercises, both internally and with external collaborators, that have revealed a number of possible concerning scenarios. For example, our red teamers discovered ways for plugins\u2014if released without safeguards\u2014to perform sophisticated prompt injection, send fraudulent and spam emails, bypass safety restrictions, or misuse information sent to the plugin. We\u2019re using these findings to inform safety-by-design mitigations that restrict risky plugin behaviors and improve transparency of how and when they're operating as part of the user experience. We're also using these findings to inform our decision to gradually deploy access to plugins.\n\nIf you\u2019re a researcher interested in studying safety risks or mitigations in this area, we encourage you to make use of our \u301052\u2020Researcher Access Program\u3011.

We\u2019re starting with a small set of users and are planning to gradually roll out larger-scale access as we learn more (for plugin developers, ChatGPT users, and after an alpha period, API users who would like to integrate plugins into their products). We\u2019re excited to build a community shaping the future of the human\u2013AI interaction paradigm.\n\nPlugin developers who have been invited off our waitlist can use our documentation to build a plugin for ChatGPT, which then lists the enabled plugins in the prompt shown to the language model as well as documentation to instruct the model how to use each. The first plugins have been created by Expedia, FiscalNote, Instacart, KAYAK, Klarna, Milo, OpenTable, Shopify, Slack, Speak, Wolfram, and Zapier.\n\n[Image]\n\nExpedia Bring your trip plans to life\u2014get there, stay there, find things to see and do.\n\n[Image]\n\nFiscalNote Provides and enables access to select market-leading, real-time data sets for legal, political, and regulatory data and information.\n\n[Image]\n\nInstacart Order from your favorite local grocery stores.\n\n[Image]\n\nKAYAK Search for flights, stays and rental cars. Get recommendations for all the places you can go within your budget.\n\n[Image]\n\nKlarna Shopping Search and compare prices from thousands of online shops.\n\n[Image]\n\nMilo Family AI Giving parents superpowers to turn the manic to magic, 20 minutes each day. Ask: Hey Milo, what\u2019s magic today?\n\n[Image]\n\nOpenTable Provides restaurant recommendations, with a direct link to book.\n\n[Image]\n\nShop Search for millions of products from the world\u2019s greatest brands.\n\n[Image]\n\nSpeak Learn how to say anything in another language with Speak, your AI-powered language tutor.\n\n[Image]\n\nWolfram Access computation, math, curated knowledge & real-time data through Wolfram|Alpha and Wolfram Language.\n\n[Image]\n\nZapier Interact with over 5,000+ apps like Google Sheets, Trello, Gmail, HubSpot, Salesforce, and more.\n\nWe\u2019re also hosting two plugins ourselves, a web browser and code interpreter. We\u2019ve also open-sourced the code for a knowledge base retrieval plugin, to be self-hosted by any developer with information with which they\u2019d like to augment ChatGPT.\n\nToday, we will begin extending plugin alpha access to users and developers from our waitlist. While we will initially prioritize a small number of developers and ChatGPT Plus users, we plan to roll out larger-scale access over time.  \n\n[Image: Example Of How To Use ChatGPT Plugins]\n\nExample of how to use ChatGPT plugins 00:59\n\n## Overview \n\nLanguage models today, while useful for a variety of tasks, are still limited. The only information they can learn from is their training data. This information can be out-of-date and is one-size fits all across applications. Furthermore, the only thing language models can do out-of-the-box is emit text. This text can contain useful instructions, but to actually follow these instructions you need another process.\n\nThough not a perfect analogy, plugins can be \u201ceyes and ears\u201d for language models, giving them access to information that is too recent, too personal, or too specific to be included in the training data. In response to a user\u2019s explicit request, plugins can also enable language models to perform safe, constrained actions on their behalf, increasing the usefulness of the system overall.\n\nWe expect that open standards will emerge to unify the ways in which applications expose an AI-facing interface. We are working on an early attempt at what such a standard might look like, and we\u2019re looking for feedback from developers interested in building with us.\n\nToday, we\u2019re beginning to gradually enable existing plugins from our early collaborators for ChatGPT users, beginning with ChatGPT Plus subscribers. We\u2019re also beginning to roll out the ability for developers to create their own plugins for ChatGPT.\n\nIn the coming months, as we learn from deployment and continue to improve our safety systems, we\u2019ll iterate on this protocol, and we plan to enable developers using OpenAI models to integrate plugins into their own applications beyond ChatGPT.  \n\n## Safety and broader implications \n\nConnecting language models to external tools introduces new opportunities as well as significant new risks.\n\nPlugins offer the potential to tackle various challenges associated with large language models, including \u201challucinations,\u201d keeping up with recent events, and accessing (with permission) proprietary information sources. By integrating explicit access to external data\u2014such as up-to-date information online, code-based calculations, or custom plugin-retrieved information\u2014language models can strengthen their responses with evidence-based references.\n\nThese references not only enhance the model\u2019s utility but also enable users to assess the trustworthiness of the model\u2019s output and double-check its accuracy, potentially mitigating risks related to overreliance as discussed in our recent GPT-4 system card. Lastly, the value of plugins may go well beyond addressing existing limitations by helping users with a variety of new use cases, ranging from browsing product catalogs to booking flights or ordering food.\n\nAt the same time, there\u2019s a risk that plugins could increase safety challenges by taking harmful or unintended actions, increasing the capabilities of bad actors who would defraud, mislead, or abuse others. By increasing the range of possible applications, plugins may raise the risk of negative consequences from mistaken or misaligned actions taken by the model in new domains. From day one, these factors have guided the development of our plugin platform, and we have implemented several safeguards.\n\n> From day one, these factors have guided the development of our plugin platform, and we have implemented several safeguards.\n\nWe\u2019ve performed red-teaming exercises, both internally and with external collaborators, that have revealed a number of possible concerning scenarios. For example, our red teamers discovered ways for plugins\u2014if released without safeguards\u2014to perform sophisticated prompt injection, send fraudulent and spam emails, bypass safety restrictions, or misuse information sent to the plugin. We\u2019re using these findings to inform safety-by-design mitigations that restrict risky plugin behaviors and improve transparency of how and when they're operating as part of the user experience. We're also using these findings to inform our decision to gradually deploy access to plugins.\n\nIf you\u2019re a researcher interested in studying safety risks or mitigations in this area, we encourage you to make use of our Researcher Access Program. We also invite developers and researchers to submit plugin-related safety and capability evaluations as part of our recently open-sourced Evals framework.\n\nPlugins will likely have wide-ranging societal implications. For example, we recently released a working paper which found that language models with access to tools will likely have much greater economic impacts than those without, and more generally, in line with other researchers\u2019 findings, we expect the current wave of AI technologies to have a big effect on the pace of job transformation, displacement, and creation. We are eager to collaborate with external researchers and our customers to study these impacts.  \n\n## Browsing \n\nAlpha \n\nAn experimental model that knows when and how to browse the internet \n\nMotivated by past work (our own WebGPT, as well as GopherCite, BlenderBot2, LaMDA2 and others), allowing language models to read information from the internet strictly expands the amount of content they can discuss, going beyond the training corpus to fresh information from the present day.\n\nHere\u2019s an example of the kind of experience that browsing opens up to ChatGPT users, that previously would have had the model politely point out that its training data didn\u2019t include enough information to let it answer.

The only information they can learn from is their training data. This information can be out-of-date and is one-size fits all across applications. Furthermore, the only thing language models can do out-of-the-box is emit text. This text can contain useful instructions, but to actually follow these instructions you need another process.\n\nThough not a perfect analogy, plugins can be \u201ceyes and ears\u201d for language models, giving them access to information that is too recent, too personal, or too specific to be included in the training data. In response to a user\u2019s explicit request, plugins can also enable language models to perform safe, constrained actions on their behalf, increasing the usefulness of the system overall.\n\nWe expect that open standards will emerge to unify the ways in which applications expose an AI-facing interface. We are working on an early attempt at what such a standard might look like, and we\u2019re looking for feedback from developers interested in building with us.\n\nToday, we\u2019re beginning to gradually enable existing plugins from our early collaborators for ChatGPT users, beginning with ChatGPT Plus subscribers. We\u2019re also beginning to roll out the ability for developers to create their own plugins for ChatGPT.\n\nIn the coming months, as we learn from deployment and continue to improve our safety systems, we\u2019ll iterate on this protocol, and we plan to enable developers using OpenAI models to integrate plugins into their own applications beyond ChatGPT.  \n\n## Safety and broader implications \n\nConnecting language models to external tools introduces new opportunities as well as significant \u301051\u2020new risks\u2020cdn.openai.com\u3011.\n\nPlugins offer the potential to tackle various challenges associated with large language models, including \u201challucinations,\u201d keeping up with recent events, and accessing (with permission) proprietary information sources. By integrating explicit access to external data\u2014such as up-to-date information online, code-based calculations, or custom plugin-retrieved information\u2014language models can strengthen their responses with evidence-based references.\n\nThese references not only enhance the model\u2019s utility but also enable users to assess the trustworthiness of the model\u2019s output and double-check its accuracy, potentially mitigating risks related to overreliance as discussed in our recent GPT-4 \u301051\u2020system card\u2020cdn.openai.com\u3011. Lastly, the value of plugins may go well beyond addressing existing limitations by helping users with a variety of new use cases, ranging from browsing product catalogs to booking flights or ordering food.\n\nAt the same time, there\u2019s a risk that plugins could increase safety challenges by taking harmful or unintended actions, increasing the capabilities of bad actors who would defraud, mislead, or abuse others. By increasing the range of possible applications, plugins may raise the risk of negative consequences from mistaken or misaligned actions taken by the model in new domains. From day one, these factors have guided the development of our plugin platform, and we have implemented several safeguards.\n\n> From day one, these factors have guided the development of our plugin platform, and we have implemented several safeguards.\n\nWe\u2019ve performed red-teaming exercises, both internally and with external collaborators, that have revealed a number of possible concerning scenarios. For example, our red teamers discovered ways for plugins\u2014if released without safeguards\u2014to perform sophisticated prompt injection, send fraudulent and spam emails, bypass safety restrictions, or misuse information sent to the plugin. We\u2019re using these findings to inform safety-by-design mitigations that restrict risky plugin behaviors and improve transparency of how and when they're operating as part of the user experience. We're also using these findings to inform our decision to gradually deploy access to plugins.\n\nIf you\u2019re a researcher interested in studying safety risks or mitigations in this area, we encourage you to make use of our \u301052\u2020Researcher Access Program\u3011. We also invite developers and researchers to submit plugin-related safety and capability evaluations as part of our recently open-sourced \u301053\u2020Evals framework\u2020github.com\u3011.\n\nPlugins will likely have wide-ranging societal implications. For example, we recently released a \u301054\u2020working paper\u2020arxiv.org\u3011 which found that language models with access to tools will likely have much greater economic impacts than those without, and more generally, in line with \u301055\u2020other\u2020papers.ssrn.com\u3011 \u301056\u2020researchers\u2019\u2020arxiv.org\u3011 findings, we expect the current wave of AI technologies to have a big effect on the pace of job transformation, displacement, and creation. We are eager to collaborate with external \u301057\u2020researchers\u2020share.hsforms.com\u3011 and our \u301058\u2020customers\u2020share.hsforms.com\u3011 to study these impacts.  \n\n## Browsing \n\nAlpha \n\nAn experimental model that knows when and how to browse the internet \n\nMotivated by past work (our own \u301059\u2020WebGPT\u3011, as well as \u301060\u2020GopherCite\u2020arxiv.org\u3011, \u301061\u2020BlenderBot2\u2020parl.ai\u3011, \u301062\u2020LaMDA2\u2020ai.googleblog.com\u3011 and \u301063\u2020others\u2020arxiv.org\u3011), allowing language models to read information from the internet strictly expands the amount of content they can discuss, going beyond the training corpus to fresh information from the present day.\n\nHere\u2019s an example of the kind of experience that browsing opens up to ChatGPT users, that previously would have had the model politely point out that its training data didn\u2019t include enough information to let it answer. This example, in which ChatGPT retrieves recent information about the latest Oscars, and then performs now-familiar ChatGPT poetry feats, is one way that browsing can be an additive experience.  \n\n[Image: Browsing Poster]\n\nChatGPT browsing plugin demo 01:11 \n\nIn addition to providing obvious utility to end-users, we think enabling language and chat models to do thorough and interpretable research has exciting prospects for \u301028\u2020scalable alignment\u3011.  \n\nTD\n\nCan you tell me what person/movie won the oscar\nVisible: 8% - 46%",

We\u2019re also beginning to roll out the ability for developers to create their own plugins for ChatGPT.\n\nIn the coming months, as we learn from deployment and continue to improve our safety systems, we\u2019ll iterate on this protocol, and we plan to enable developers using OpenAI models to integrate plugins into their own applications beyond ChatGPT.  \n\n## Safety and broader implications \n\nConnecting language models to external tools introduces new opportunities as well as significant new risks.\n\nPlugins offer the potential to tackle various challenges associated with large language models, including \u201challucinations,\u201d keeping up with recent events, and accessing (with permission) proprietary information sources. By integrating explicit access to external data\u2014such as up-to-date information online, code-based calculations, or custom plugin-retrieved information\u2014language models can strengthen their responses with evidence-based references.\n\nThese references not only enhance the model\u2019s utility but also enable users to assess the trustworthiness of the model\u2019s output and double-check its accuracy, potentially mitigating risks related to overreliance as discussed in our recent GPT-4 system card. Lastly, the value of plugins may go well beyond addressing existing limitations by helping users with a variety of new use cases, ranging from browsing product catalogs to booking flights or ordering food.\n\nAt the same time, there\u2019s a risk that plugins could increase safety challenges by taking harmful or unintended actions, increasing the capabilities of bad actors who would defraud, mislead, or abuse others. By increasing the range of possible applications, plugins may raise the risk of negative consequences from mistaken or misaligned actions taken by the model in new domains. From day one, these factors have guided the development of our plugin platform, and we have implemented several safeguards.\n\n> From day one, these factors have guided the development of our plugin platform, and we have implemented several safeguards.\n\nWe\u2019ve performed red-teaming exercises, both internally and with external collaborators, that have revealed a number of possible concerning scenarios. For example, our red teamers discovered ways for plugins\u2014if released without safeguards\u2014to perform sophisticated prompt injection, send fraudulent and spam emails, bypass safety restrictions, or misuse information sent to the plugin. We\u2019re using these findings to inform safety-by-design mitigations that restrict risky plugin behaviors and improve transparency of how and when they're operating as part of the user experience. We're also using these findings to inform our decision to gradually deploy access to plugins.\n\nIf you\u2019re a researcher interested in studying safety risks or mitigations in this area, we encourage you to make use of our Researcher Access Program. We also invite developers and researchers to submit plugin-related safety and capability evaluations as part of our recently open-sourced Evals framework.\n\nPlugins will likely have wide-ranging societal implications. For example, we recently released a working paper which found that language models with access to tools will likely have much greater economic impacts than those without, and more generally, in line with other researchers\u2019 findings, we expect the current wave of AI technologies to have a big effect on the pace of job transformation, displacement, and creation. We are eager to collaborate with external researchers and our customers to study these impacts.  \n\n## Browsing \n\nAlpha \n\nAn experimental model that knows when and how to browse the internet \n\nMotivated by past work (our own WebGPT, as well as GopherCite, BlenderBot2, LaMDA2 and others), allowing language models to read information from the internet strictly expands the amount of content they can discuss, going beyond the training corpus to fresh information from the present day.\n\nHere\u2019s an example of the kind of experience that browsing opens up to ChatGPT users, that previously would have had the model politely point out that its training data didn\u2019t include enough information to let it answer. This example, in which ChatGPT retrieves recent information about the latest Oscars, and then performs now-familiar ChatGPT poetry feats, is one way that browsing can be an additive experience.  \n\n[Image: Browsing Poster]\n\nChatGPT browsing plugin demo 01:11 \n\nIn addition to providing obvious utility to end-users, we think enabling language and chat models to do thorough and interpretable research has exciting prospects for scalable alignment.  \n\nTD\n\nCan you tell me what person/movie won the oscar\nVisible: 8% - 46%",

                            "Based on my research, there isn't a specific ChatGPT plugin that's directly recommended for analyzing student spreadsheet data and determining a grading system. However, ChatGPT itself can be a valuable tool when working with spreadsheet data. It can provide real-time assistance and answer Excel-related queries, generate prompts and code examples for both everyday and complex Excel tasks, and even help with creating macros for data analysis and manipulation. Some examples include creating formulas, macros, and data analysis tasks, like generating charts based on a range of data\u30107\u2020source\u3011\u30108\u2020source\u3011\u30109\u2020source\u3011\u301010\u2020source\u3011.\n\nChatGPT can be used to generate Excel code and provide instructions in plain English, making it a powerful tool for anyone looking to gain valuable insights from their data and make informed decisions\u301011\u2020source\u3011\u301012\u2020source\u3011. As such, you could use ChatGPT to help build a grading system in Excel by asking it for guidance on creating formulas and macros that calculate grades based on your specific criteria.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that while ChatGPT can provide valuable assistance, you should always double-check the generated code to ensure it's doing what you want it to do and test it with sample data to ensure it's accurate and functioning as expected\u301011\u2020source\u3011.\n\nI also found mentions of a ChatGPT browser extension that allows you to interact with ChatGPT directly from your browser, but it wasn't clear whether this extension could be used specifically for grading purposes or in conjunction with Excel.\n\nUnfortunately, I wasn't able to find more specific information on a ChatGPT plugin or tool designed for creating a grading system. It's possible that such a tool doesn't exist yet, or it may simply be that the information isn't readily available online. If you're looking for a more automated solution, you might consider exploring other AI tools or software designed for educational grading and data analysis.\n\nI hope this information is helpful, and I'm sorry I couldn't find a more specific answer to your question.

Here are some best practices for using ChatGPT with Excel.\n\n### 1. Use Clear and Concise Prompts\n\nWhen working with ChatGPT, it's essential to use clear and concise prompts that accurately convey your goal. A highly complex or convoluted prompt can hinder the bot\u2019s ability to provide accurate responses.\n\nFor instance, a prompt like \"Can you please tell me the average sales figures for the previous quarter, excluding sales from the southeast region, and sorted by date in descending order?\" might be too complicated for ChatGPT to parse and provide a meaningful response accurately.\n\n### 2. Double-Check the Generated Code\n\nChatGPT is an AI-based tool, and while it's usually very accurate, it's always a good idea to double-check the generated code to ensure it's doing what you want it to do. Test the generated code with sample data to ensure it's accurate and functioning as expected.\n\nWhen using ChatGPT to generate a macro, review the code carefully and check for syntax errors or logical inconsistencies. Testing the macro with sample data can also help ensure it functions as expected.\n\n### 3. Start With More Straightforward Problems\n\nIf you're new to using ChatGPT with Excel, starting with more specific and straightforward issues is a good idea to understand how the tool works. For example, you can begin by asking for formulas to sort and filter data in Excel or create a pivot table.\n\nAs you become more comfortable using ChatGPT with Excel, you can move on to more complex problems, such as creating custom functions or automating repetitive tasks with macros",

You can use pandas to load the spreadsheet data (e.g., Excel or CSV file), perform statistical analysis, and even clean the data if needed.\n\n2. **Grading System**: Based on the analysis, you could design a grading system.

He took my advanced computer science class and really enjoyed it. It was the first advanced computer science class that the school ever had, so he took a big chance at more challenging content and was very successful. I want to let him know I appreciated that and that I respect the fact he dd that, and that. I think if he continues to feel confident and take chances and work hard he will have much success in the future. \n\nPlease write a brief paragraph that conveys this sentiment in a natural tone.

This includes fostering engagement and exploration in areas such as programming, digital art, digital music, and game development, among others. I am thrilled to announce that this year, I've been the recipient of a state grant dedicated to promoting student engagement.\n\nUtilizing these funds, I am in the process of establishing an innovative 'Studio' room, akin to an AV room, yet tailored more towards promoting creativity and exploration. The core aim of this initiative is to reveal the vast potential of computer technology beyond the realm of social media, inspiring students to perceive and interact with technology in diverse, expansive ways.\n\nI am eager to experiment with the integration of the Push 3 technology into our program, considering its standalone features that promise to be more accessible and less intimidating for the students. This could be a real game-changer, particularly for those who might have found the Push 2/Ableton suite challenging to navigate. Depending on the success of this initial integration, there is potential for further expansion of this exciting venture. As a satisfied Push user myself, I am personally convinced of its potential to heighten student engagement and enthusiasm in our innovative technology curriculum."

This includes engagement in various areas such as programming, digital art, digital music, and game development. This year, I am the recipient of a state grant aimed at enhancing student engagement.\n\nLeveraging this grant, I am developing a 'Studio' room. This space, while similar to an AV room, emphasizes exploration and creative application of computer technology, challenging students to move beyond common uses of digital devices like social media.\n\nAs part of the technology suite in this learning space, I am considering the addition of Push 3 devices. Their standalone functionality has the potential to provide a less daunting introduction to digital music technology compared to the Push 2/Ableton suite. As a current user of Push devices, I am confident in their capacity to contribute to our educational objectives. Success with initial implementation may warrant further use of these tools within our curriculum."

This query performs a simultaneous join on both conditions, which means the rows from `table1` and `table2` must satisfy both conditions together.\n\nIn the second query you provided:\n\n```sql\nSELECT t1.column1, t1.column2, t2.column1, t2.column2\nFROM table1 t1\nINNER JOIN table2 t2 ON t2.column1 = t1.column1;\nINNER JOIN table2 t3 ON t3.column2 = t1.column2;\n```\n\nThe second join condition (`t3.column2 = t1.column2`) is placed outside the first `INNER JOIN` statement, creating two separate join statements. This results in a different behavior: the first join (`INNER JOIN table2 t2 ON t2.column1 = t1.column1`) is applied first, and then the second join (`INNER JOIN table2 t3 ON t3.column2 = t1.column2`) is applied to the intermediate result.\n\nTherefore, the two queries are not equivalent, and the results would differ."

We want to calculate the average revenue for each product across all regions, as well as the total revenue for each region.\n\nUsing a window function, we can achieve this by partitioning the data by the \"product\" column and calculating the average revenue and total revenue over each partition.\n\nHere's an example query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT\n    product,\n    region,\n    date,\n    revenue,\n    AVG(revenue) OVER (PARTITION BY product) AS avg_product_revenue,\n    SUM(revenue) OVER (PARTITION BY region) AS total_region_revenue\nFROM\n    sales;\n```\n\nIn this query, the `AVG(revenue) OVER (PARTITION BY product)` calculates the average revenue for each product partition, and the `SUM(revenue) OVER (PARTITION BY region)` calculates the total revenue for each region partition.\n\nThe result will include all the columns from the \"sales\" table, as well as two additional columns: \"avg_product_revenue\" and \"total_region_revenue\" that show the average revenue for each product and the total revenue for each region, respectively."

                            "Window functions provide a powerful and flexible way to perform calculations and analysis over a specific subset of rows in a result set, without the need for explicit subqueries or self-joins. Here are some benefits and use cases of using window functions:\n\n1. Aggregating and Analyzing Data: Window functions allow you to perform calculations such as calculating averages, sums, counts, minimum and maximum values, ranking, and more. They provide a concise and efficient way to aggregate and analyze data within partitions or groups.\n\n2. Simplifying Queries: Window functions help eliminate the need for complex self-joins or subqueries by allowing you to perform calculations directly within the main query. This simplifies the query structure and improves readability.\n\n3. Accessing Data Across Rows: Window functions enable you to access data from other rows in the same result set without joining tables or duplicating data. This is particularly useful when you need to compare values or perform calculations based on the values of neighboring rows.\n\n4. Customizing Window Frames: Window functions allow you to define the window frame, which determines the subset of rows used in calculations. You can specify ranges of rows relative to the current row, such as including all preceding rows or a specific number of preceding and following rows. This flexibility provides control over the scope of calculations.\n\n5. Handling Ranking and Ordering: Window functions offer convenient ways to assign ranks, row numbers, and dense ranks to rows based on specified criteria. This can be useful for generating leaderboard rankings, identifying top performers, or selecting specific subsets of data.\n\nOverall, window functions enhance the analytical capabilities of SQL queries, providing a concise and efficient way to perform calculations, analyze data within partitions, and access information across rows, leading to more concise and readable queries."

                            "Certainly! Let's explain the concepts of PRECEDING, FOLLOWING, UNBOUNDED PRECEDING, and UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING using a simple example.\n\nSuppose we have a table called \"orders\" with the columns \"order_date\" and \"revenue\" that represents daily revenue from different orders.\n\n```\norder_date  | revenue\n---------------------\n2023-05-01  | 100\n2023-05-02  | 150\n2023-05-03  | 200\n2023-05-04  | 250\n2023-05-05  | 300\n```\n\nNow let's say we want to calculate the cumulative revenue for each order, considering the revenue of all previous orders.\n\nUsing window functions, we can achieve this by specifying the window frame with PRECEDING and FOLLOWING.\n\nExample 1: PRECEDING and FOLLOWING\n```sql\nSELECT \n    order_date,\n    revenue,\n    SUM(revenue) OVER (ORDER BY order_date ROWS BETWEEN 1 PRECEDING AND 1 FOLLOWING) AS cumulative_revenue\nFROM\n    orders;\n```\n\nIn this example, the window frame is defined as \"ROWS BETWEEN 1 PRECEDING AND 1 FOLLOWING\". It means that for each row, the calculation includes the current row, the row preceding it, and the row following it.\n\nThe result will be:\n\n```\norder_date  | revenue | cumulative_revenue\n------------------------------------------\n2023-05-01  | 100     | 250 (100 + 150)\n2023-05-02  | 150     | 500 (100 + 150 + 200)\n2023-05-03  | 200     | 800 (150 + 200 + 250)\n2023-05-04  | 250     | 750 (200 + 250 + 300)\n2023-05-05  | 300     | 550 (250 + 300)\n```\n\nExample 2: UNBOUNDED PRECEDING and UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING\n```sql\nSELECT \n    order_date,\n    revenue,\n    SUM(revenue) OVER (ORDER BY order_date ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING) AS cumulative_revenue\nFROM\n    orders;\n```\n\nIn this example, the window frame is defined as \"ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING\". It means that for each row, the calculation includes all rows from the beginning of the partition (unbounded preceding) to the end of the partition (unbounded following).\n\nThe result will be:\n\n```\norder_date  | revenue | cumulative_revenue\n------------------------------------------\n2023-05-01  | 100     | 100\n2023-05-02  | 150     | 250 (100 + 150)\n2023-05-03  | 200     | 450 (100 + 150 + 200)\n2023-05-04  | 250     | 700 (100 + 150 + 200 + 250)\n2023-05-05  | 300     | 1000 (100 + 150 + 200 + 250 + 300)\n```\n\nIn this example, the cumulative revenue includes the revenue of all previous orders in the partition.\n\nBy using the PRECEDING and FOLLOWING keywords, or UNBOUNDED PRECEDING and UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING, you can define the window frame to specify the range of rows considered in the calculation, providing flexibility in aggregating and analyzing data using window functions."

                            "Certainly! Let's take a simple example dataset and calculate the moving average using the window function with a window frame that includes the current date and the two previous dates. We can then visualize the moving average using a simple plot.\n\nConsider the following dataset of daily revenue:\n\n```\norder_date  | revenue\n---------------------\n2023-05-01  | 100\n2023-05-02  | 150\n2023-05-03  | 200\n2023-05-04  | 250\n2023-05-05  | 300\n2023-05-06  | 350\n2023-05-07  | 400\n```\n\nHere's an example query to calculate the moving average and plot it using Python and matplotlib:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Assuming the dataset is stored in a DataFrame called 'df'\ndf = pd.DataFrame({\n    'order_date': ['2023-05-01', '2023-05-02', '2023-05-03', '2023-05-04', '2023-05-05', '2023-05-06', '2023-05-07'],\n    'revenue': [100, 150, 200, 250, 300, 350, 400]\n})\n\n# Convert the 'order_date' column to datetime\ndf['order_date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['order_date'])\n\n# Calculate the moving average using window function\ndf['moving_average'] = df['revenue'].rolling(window=3, min_periods=1).mean()\n\n# Plotting the moving average\nplt.plot(df['order_date'], df['moving_average'])\nplt.xlabel('Date')\nplt.ylabel('Moving Average')\nplt.title('Moving Average of Daily Revenue')\nplt.xticks(rotation=45)\nplt.show()\n```\n\nIn this example, we first convert the 'order_date' column to datetime format. Then, we use the `rolling` function with `window=3` to calculate the moving average over the current date and the two previous dates. Finally, we plot the moving average using `plt.plot()` from the matplotlib library.\n\nThe resulting plot will display the moving average of daily revenue over time. Adjust the example according to your specific dataset and plotting requirements."

Using UNBOUNDED PRECEDING:\n```sql\nSELECT\n    order_date,\n    revenue,\n    SUM(revenue) OVER (ORDER BY order_date ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) AS cumulative_revenue\nFROM\n    sales;\n```\n\nThis query calculates the cumulative revenue from the start of the partition (the first row) up to and including the current row. The result will be:\n\n```\norder_date  | revenue | cumulative_revenue\n------------------------------------------\n2023-01-01  | 100     | 100\n2023-01-02  | 150     | 250 (100 + 150)\n2023-01-03  | 200     | 450 (100 + 150 + 200)\n2023-01-04  | 250     | 700 (100 + 150 + 200 + 250)\n2023-01-05  | 300     | 1000 (100 + 150 + 200 + 250 + 300)\n```\n\n2. Using UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING:\n```sql\nSELECT\n    order_date,\n    revenue,\n    SUM(revenue) OVER (ORDER BY order_date ROWS BETWEEN CURRENT ROW AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING) AS cumulative_revenue\nFROM\n    sales;\n```\n\nThis query calculates the cumulative revenue from the current row up to and including the end of the partition (the last row). The result will be:\n\n```\norder_date  | revenue | cumulative_revenue\n------------------------------------------\n2023-01-01  | 100     | 1000 (100 + 150 + 200 + 250 + 300)\n2023-01-02  | 150     | 900 (150 + 200 + 250 + 300)\n2023-01-03  | 200     | 750 (200 + 250 + 300)\n2023-01-04  | 250     | 550 (250 + 300)\n2023-01-05  | 300     | 300 (300)\n```\n\nIn summary, UNBOUNDED PRECEDING includes all rows from the start of the partition up to and including the current row, while UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING includes all rows from the current row up to and including the end of the partition."

Here's an example query that achieves this:\n\n```sql\nSELECT\n    s.internet_service,\n    COUNT(CASE WHEN c.techie = 'yes' THEN 1 END) AS techie_yes_count,\n    COUNT(CASE WHEN c.techie = 'no' THEN 1 END) AS techie_no_count\nFROM\n    Services s\nJOIN\n    Customers c ON s.customer_id = c.customer_id\nGROUP BY\n    s.internet_service;\n```\n\nIn this query, we perform an inner join between the \"Services\" and \"Customers\" tables based on the \"customer_id\" field. We then use conditional aggregation to count the occurrences of \"yes\" and \"no\" values for each \"internet_service\" option. The `CASE` statement checks the value of the \"techie\" field in the \"Customers\" table, and the counts are performed using the `COUNT` function. Finally, we group the results by the \"internet_service\" field.\n\nThe result will provide the count of \"yes\" and \"no\" for each \"internet_service\" option, showing the number of customers with the respective techie status."

                            "While AI and machine learning have certainly made significant advances in data analysis, they are tools that assist and complement the work of a Data Analyst, not replace them. Here are a few reasons why:\n\n1. **Interpretation and Application of Results**: AI can generate insights from data, but understanding and applying these insights in a business context often requires human judgment and knowledge. Data analysts understand the business domain, and they can interpret the results in light of that understanding. They can also advise decision-makers on how to act on these insights.\n\n2. **Data Quality**: AI and machine learning models are only as good as the data they are trained on. Data analysts play a crucial role in ensuring data quality, identifying errors, and cleaning the data before it is used.\n\n3. **Model Selection and Fine-tuning**: While AI can perform complex calculations, choosing the right model and tuning its parameters for a specific problem still requires human expertise. Data analysts have the knowledge and experience to make these choices.\n\n4. **Ethics and Privacy**: Data analysts understand the ethical implications and privacy requirements of the data they work with. They ensure that data usage complies with regulations and respects user privacy.\n\n5. **Communication**: Data analysts often serve as a bridge between the technical and non-technical stakeholders in a company. They have the skills to present and explain complex data insights in an understandable way to decision-makers.\n\n6. **Problem Solving**: Every business problem is unique, and often, pre-existing AI solutions will not fit perfectly. Data analysts are needed to understand the problem, design a solution, and iterate on it as necessary.\n\n7. **Training and Evaluating AI**: AI models often need to be trained, tested, and refined over time. Data analysts have the skills to perform these tasks.\n\nAI and automation will likely change the job of data analysts, reducing the time they spend on routine tasks and giving them more time for high-level analysis and strategy. They may spend less time on tasks like data cleaning and more time on tasks like interpreting and communicating results. They will also likely need to gain additional skills, such as understanding how to work with AI and machine learning models. But the core of their job\u2014making sense of data and using it to drive decision-making\u2014will remain crucial."

                            "That's true. AI is continually improving, and its capabilities will likely expand in the future. However, there are some aspects of data analysis that are fundamentally about human judgment and understanding, and these are areas where AI may complement human abilities rather than replace them.\n\n1. **Contextual Understanding**: AI models can analyze data, but they do not understand the real-world context in the same way humans do. For example, if a data pattern changes due to a recent event (like a market shift or a global pandemic), a human analyst can incorporate that knowledge into their analysis, while an AI might miss this context.\n\n2. **Ethics and Bias**: AI models can inadvertently perpetuate and even amplify existing biases in data. Human oversight is needed to ensure that analyses are fair and ethical. Moreover, decisions about what data to collect and use in analyses involve ethical judgments that AI is currently incapable of making.\n\n3. **Creativity and Intuition**: Some parts of data analysis involve creativity and intuition. For example, coming up with new hypotheses to test or finding innovative ways to visualize data are areas where humans excel. While AI can support these tasks, it is not likely to replace human creativity and intuition.\n\n4. **Uncertainty and Ambiguity**: Real-world data is often messy and ambiguous. Humans are good at dealing with this kind of uncertainty and making reasoned judgments in the face of ambiguity. While AI is getting better at handling uncertain data, it still has limitations in this area.\n\n5. **Communication and Persuasion**: Part of a data analyst's job is to communicate findings to decision-makers and persuade them to act on those findings. This involves understanding the concerns and priorities of the audience, something that AI is not currently capable of.\n\nWhile AI will continue to evolve and improve, it's likely that the role of data analysts will also evolve. They may work more closely with AI, using it as a tool to help them analyze and interpret data. They may also need to develop new skills, such as understanding and working with AI systems. But the core of their job - understanding data in a human context - is likely to remain important."

                            "A subquery is a query nested within another query. It allows you to retrieve data from one table based on the results of another query. There are two main types of subqueries: simple subqueries and correlated subqueries. Let's explore their differences and similarities with examples.\n\n1. Simple Subqueries:\n   - A simple subquery is an independent subquery that can be executed on its own without any reference to the outer query.\n   - The result of a simple subquery is computed once and used as a constant value in the outer query.\n   - Example: Suppose we have two tables, \"Employees\" and \"Departments,\" with a one-to-many relationship. We want to retrieve all employees who belong to a department with the highest average salary.\n     ```sql\n     SELECT EmployeeName\n     FROM Employees\n     WHERE DepartmentID = (\n         SELECT DepartmentID\n         FROM Departments\n         WHERE AverageSalary = (\n             SELECT MAX(AverageSalary)\n             FROM Departments\n         )\n     );\n     ```\n     In this example, the inner subquery `(SELECT MAX(AverageSalary) FROM Departments)` returns a constant value that is used to find the department with the highest average salary. The outer subquery `(SELECT DepartmentID FROM Departments WHERE AverageSalary = ...)` uses this constant value to retrieve the department ID.\n\n2. Correlated Subqueries:\n   - A correlated subquery is a subquery that depends on the outer query and is executed repeatedly for each row of the outer query.\n   - The result of a correlated subquery is evaluated for each row of the outer query, and it can refer to columns from the outer query.\n   - Example: Let's say we have the same \"Employees\" and \"Departments\" tables. We want to retrieve all departments that have at least one employee with a salary higher than the department's average salary.\n     ```sql\n     SELECT DepartmentName\n     FROM Departments d\n     WHERE EXISTS (\n         SELECT 1\n         FROM Employees e\n         WHERE e.DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID\n         AND e.Salary > (\n             SELECT AVG(Salary)\n             FROM Employees\n             WHERE DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID\n         )\n     );\n     ```\n     In this example, the inner subquery `(SELECT AVG(Salary) FROM Employees WHERE DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID)` is correlated with the outer query. It calculates the average salary for each department individually, based on the current row of the outer query. The correlated subquery is executed repeatedly for each department to check if there exists at least one employee with a higher salary.\n\nIn summary, the main difference between simple subqueries and correlated subqueries is their dependency on the outer query. Simple subqueries are independent and provide a constant value for the outer query, while correlated subqueries are executed repeatedly and refer to columns from the outer query. Both types of subqueries are powerful tools to retrieve data based on conditions derived from other queries."

                            "A nested subquery, also known as a nested subselect or simply a nested query, is a subquery that is located within another subquery. It involves nesting multiple levels of subqueries to perform complex data retrieval or manipulation tasks. Each level of nesting adds another layer of subqueries. \n\nLet's look at an example to understand nested subqueries:\n\nSuppose we have three tables: \"Customers,\" \"Orders,\" and \"Products.\" We want to find the names of customers who have placed orders for products with a price higher than the average price of all products.\n\n```sql\nSELECT CustomerName\nFROM Customers\nWHERE CustomerID IN (\n  SELECT CustomerID\n  FROM Orders\n  WHERE ProductID IN (\n    SELECT ProductID\n    FROM Products\n    WHERE Price > (\n      SELECT AVG(Price)\n      FROM Products\n    )\n  )\n);\n```\n\nIn this example, we have three levels of nesting:\n\n1. The innermost subquery `(SELECT AVG(Price) FROM Products)` calculates the average price of all products.\n2. The next level subquery `(SELECT ProductID FROM Products WHERE Price > ...)` retrieves the ProductIDs of products with a price higher than the average price.\n3. The outermost subquery `(SELECT CustomerID FROM Orders WHERE ProductID IN ...)` finds the CustomerIDs of customers who have placed orders for those products.\n\nThe final result is obtained by the outermost query `(SELECT CustomerName FROM Customers WHERE CustomerID IN ...)`, which selects the names of customers based on their CustomerIDs obtained from the nested subqueries.\n\nNested subqueries allow us to break down complex queries into smaller, more manageable parts. Each level of nesting builds upon the results of the previous level, enabling us to retrieve or manipulate data based on multiple conditions and calculations."

                            "The EXTRACT function is a built-in function in SQL that allows you to extract a specific part (such as year, month, day, hour, etc.) from a date or time value. The syntax of the EXTRACT function varies slightly depending on the database system you are using, but the general usage is as follows:\n\n```\nEXTRACT(unit FROM datetime_expression)\n```\n\nHere, `unit` specifies the part you want to extract, and `datetime_expression` is the date or time value from which you want to extract the specified part.\n\nLet's take a look at some examples of using the EXTRACT function with different units:\n\n1. Extracting the year:\n   ```sql\n   SELECT EXTRACT(YEAR FROM '2023-05-18');\n   ```\n   Output: `2023`\n\n2. Extracting the month:\n   ```sql\n   SELECT EXTRACT(MONTH FROM '2023-05-18');\n   ```\n   Output: `5`\n\n3. Extracting the day:\n   ```sql\n   SELECT EXTRACT(DAY FROM '2023-05-18');\n   ```\n   Output: `18`\n\n4. Extracting the hour:\n   ```sql\n   SELECT EXTRACT(HOUR FROM '2023-05-18 14:30:00');\n   ```\n   Output: `14`\n\n5. Extracting the minute:\n   ```sql\n   SELECT EXTRACT(MINUTE FROM '2023-05-18 14:30:00');\n   ```\n   Output: `30`\n\n6. Extracting the second:\n   ```sql\n   SELECT EXTRACT(SECOND FROM '2023-05-18 14:30:15');\n   ```\n   Output: `15`\n\nNote that the units you can extract may vary slightly depending on the database system. Common units include YEAR, MONTH, DAY, HOUR, MINUTE, SECOND, and so on. The result of the EXTRACT function is typically an integer representing the extracted value.\n\nUsing the EXTRACT function, you can perform various operations and calculations based on specific parts of date or time values in your SQL queries."

Deciding on techniques to use\nAt this point in the course, you're probably wondering why we're covering so many different methods of performing similar tasks.\n\n2. Different names for the same thing?\nThat's a great question. The simplest answer is that yes, there is a lot of overlap between use cases for joins, subqueries, and common table expressions. Many questions that you answer can use these techniques interchangeably without sacrificing query run time or the accuracy of your output. But these techniques are not identical.\n\n3. Differentiating Techniques\nLet's take a minute to compare the techniques we've been using in this and the previous chapter. Joins allow you to directly combine information from 2 or more tables, and on their own, are mostly limited to simple combinations and aggregations of tables already present in your database. A correlated subquery allows you to combine information between a subquery and a table, or another subquery. These help you simplify your syntax and circumvent the limits of a join -- namely, that you can't join two separate columns in one table, to a single column in another at a time. We saw this in the \"match\" table, where you can't retrieve the team name from the \"team\" table for both the home and away teams at the same time. A correlated query can solve that problem. However, it's important to remember that correlated subqueries take a long time to process, and will slow down your query performance. Multiple and nested subqueries are useful when your data requires multi-step transformations before it's in the form you need for your final query. Breaking down the steps of your query process allows for better accuracy and reproducibility in your work. Finally, common table expressions allow you to organize your subqueries sequentially by declaring them at the beginning of your query. Since CTEs are processed one at a time before your main query, you can reference information from a CTE created earlier, thus serving as an alternative to nested subqueries.\n\n4. So which do I use?\nSo which one do you use? Often, it really depends on the database you're using, the field that you're working in, and the questions that you're asking. In general, I recommend that you practice each technique with your own databases to determine which allows you to best use and reuse your queries and generate clear and accurate results.\n\n5. Different use cases\nBefore we move on, I'll share a few examples of questions that each of these approaches can be used for. As you've seen, joins are a universally important skill when working with a database that has more than 1 table. It's fair to say that joins are necessary to understand each of the following techniques. Correlated subqueries are great for matching data from different columns in one or more tables, such as determining who each employee's immediate supervisor is. Multiple and nested subqueries are great for answering questions such as, what is the average deal size closed by each sales representative in the last quarter, which would require multiple steps to transform and prepare before generating the final query. Finally, CTEs are excellent for comparing a large number of disparate pieces of information. For example, you may want to create a summary table examining the marketing, sales, growth, and engineering teams' performance on their key metrics last quarter. With CTEs, you can extract data about each team's performance one after another, and combine them into a single query.\n\n\n"

Deciding on techniques to use      | Joins are commonly used to combine tables and perform aggregations. They are efficient for simple combinations of tables already present in the database.                                      | Correlated subqueries are useful when you need to combine information between a subquery and a table, or another subquery. They can help overcome join limitations and handle specific conditions.    | Multiple and nested subqueries are valuable when your data requires multi-step transformations before achieving the desired format for your final query. They allow for better control and accuracy.  | Common table expressions (CTEs) enable you to create temporary named result sets that can be referenced later in the query. They enhance query readability and allow for easier reuse of subqueries. |\n| 2. Different names for the same thing?| Joins, subqueries, and common table expressions have overlapping use cases, but they are not identical. Each technique has its strengths and can be utilized interchangeably in some scenarios, while offering specific advantages in others. | Correlated subqueries are a specific type of subquery that are used to retrieve data related to each row of the outer query. They can handle cases where direct joins are not feasible.               | Multiple and nested subqueries are valuable for complex queries that involve multi-step data transformations, allowing you to break down the query logic into manageable components.           | Common table expressions (CTEs) provide a way to create temporary named result sets that can be referenced multiple times within a single query. They offer improved readability and query organization. |\n| 3. Differentiating Techniques         | Joins directly combine information from two or more tables, primarily for simple combinations and aggregations. They are efficient for joining tables present in the database.            | Correlated subqueries allow for matching data from different columns in one or more tables. They are useful when you need to establish relationships between tables based on specific conditions.     | Multiple and nested subqueries are flexible tools for handling complex transformations and enable step-by-step processing of data to achieve the desired output.                         | Common table expressions (CTEs) allow for organizing subqueries sequentially by declaring them at the beginning of the query. They offer improved readability and reusability of subqueries.       |\n| 4. So which do I use?                 | The choice of technique depends on factors such as database structure, query complexity, and specific requirements. It is recommended to practice and experiment with each technique to determine the most suitable approach for a given scenario. | The decision to use correlated subqueries depends on the specific scenario and the limitations of traditional joins. Evaluate the trade-offs in terms of performance and clarity when selecting this technique. | The use of multiple and nested subqueries depends on the complexity of the data transformations required to achieve the desired output. Consider the query performance implications when utilizing this technique.   | The decision to use CTEs depends on the complexity and organization of the query. They provide a way to enhance query readability and reuse subqueries, particularly when dealing with large and complex queries. |\n| 5. Different use cases                | Joins are universally important for combining data from multiple tables and are fundamental in relational databases. They are required for various scenarios such as fetching related information, aggregating data, and performing analysis. | Correlated subqueries are useful for scenarios where you need to match data from different columns in one or more tables. They are commonly used for tasks like finding immediate supervisors or filtering data"

                            "Yes, subqueries in SQL typically act on rows of data. \n\nA subquery is a query nested within another query, and it operates on a subset of data selected from a table or the result of another query. The subquery is executed for each row of the outer query, providing a row-level operation.\n\nIn a correlated subquery, the subquery references columns from the outer query and is evaluated for each row of the outer query. The subquery's result is determined based on the specific values of the outer query's current row.\n\nFor example, consider the following query that uses a correlated subquery to find all customers who have placed orders for a specific product:\n\n```sql\nSELECT CustomerName\nFROM Customers\nWHERE CustomerID IN (\n    SELECT CustomerID\n    FROM Orders\n    WHERE ProductID = '123'\n);\n```\n\nIn this case, the subquery `(SELECT CustomerID FROM Orders WHERE ProductID = '123')` is executed for each row in the outer query's `Customers` table. It selects the `CustomerID` values from the `Orders` table where the `ProductID` is '123'. The outer query then checks if the `CustomerID` exists in the result of the subquery, determining which customers have placed orders for that specific product.\n\nSubqueries can be powerful tools for performing row-level operations, allowing you to filter, aggregate, or manipulate data based on conditions and calculations involving the rows of the underlying tables."

The result of the subquery is evaluated in the context of each row of the outer query. This allows you to compare or match data between the subquery and the corresponding row of the outer query.\n\nThe correlation occurs through the use of correlated variables, typically in the form of references to columns from the outer query in the subquery's conditions. These correlated variables establish the relationship between the subquery and the outer query.\n\nBy acting on each row individually, correlated subqueries can be used to perform row-level comparisons or filtering based on conditions specific to each row. This allows for more fine-grained control and flexibility in data retrieval and manipulation. However, it's important to note that correlated subqueries can be computationally expensive and impact query performance, especially when dealing with large datasets."

                            "Certainly! Let's consider a simple example with two tables: \"Customers\" and \"Orders.\" The \"Customers\" table contains customer information, and the \"Orders\" table contains order information with a foreign key referencing the customer.\n\nCustomers table:\n```\n+----+----------+\n| ID | Customer |\n+----+----------+\n| 1  | John     |\n| 2  | Sarah    |\n| 3  | Emma     |\n+----+----------+\n```\n\nOrders table:\n```\n+---------+------------+\n| OrderID | CustomerID |\n+---------+------------+\n| 101     | 1          |\n| 102     | 2          |\n| 103     | 1          |\n+---------+------------+\n```\n\nLet's say we want to retrieve all customers who have placed more than one order. We can use a correlated subquery to achieve this.\n\n```sql\nSELECT Customer\nFROM Customers c\nWHERE (\n  SELECT COUNT(*)\n  FROM Orders o\n  WHERE o.CustomerID = c.ID\n) > 1;\n```\n\nHere's how the correlated subquery would work behind the scenes with a 3-row example:\n\n1. The outer query starts with the first row from the \"Customers\" table, where the ID is 1 and the customer is \"John.\"\n2. The inner subquery is executed for this row, comparing the CustomerID from the \"Orders\" table with the ID from the outer query. It counts the number of orders placed by the customer with ID 1, which is 2.\n3. The result of the inner subquery (2) is compared with the condition in the outer query, which checks if the count is greater than 1.\n4. Since the count is indeed greater than 1, the customer \"John\" is included in the final result set.\n5. The same process is repeated for the second row of the outer query, corresponding to the customer with ID 2 (\"Sarah\"). The inner subquery counts the orders for customer 2, which is 1.\n6. As the count is not greater than 1, the customer \"Sarah\" is excluded from the result set.\n7. Finally, the third row of the outer query is processed, corresponding to the customer with ID 3 (\"Emma\"). The inner subquery counts the orders for customer 3, which is 0.\n8. As the count is not greater than 1, the customer \"Emma\" is also excluded from the result set.\n9. The result set from the query execution is returned, containing only the customer \"John\" who has placed more than one order.\n\nIn this example, the correlated subquery is executed for each row of the outer query, allowing us to perform row-level comparisons and retrieve the desired data based on the conditions specified in the subquery."

The correlated subquery only considers the rows in the \"Orders\" table that match the WHERE clause condition (`o.CustomerID = c.ID`). It doesn't need to check every row in the \"Orders\" table for each row in the \"Customers\" table.\n\nThe correlation between the outer and inner query is established by the condition in the subquery's WHERE clause. It filters the rows from the \"Orders\" table based on the CustomerID that matches the current row's ID from the outer \"Customers\" table.\n\nIn the given example, the subquery is executed once for each row in the \"Customers\" table. It retrieves the count of orders for the specific customer ID from the outer query. Therefore, the subquery considers only the rows in the \"Orders\" table where the CustomerID matches the current customer's ID from the outer query.\n\nThis correlation allows the query to retrieve the count of orders for each customer individually, rather than checking every row in the \"Orders\" table for each customer row. It improves the efficiency of the query by narrowing down the focus to the relevant rows in the \"Orders\" table based on the correlation condition."

                            "Yes, in a way, you can think of Common Table Expressions (CTEs) as creating temporary named result sets or virtual tables that can be referenced multiple times within a single query. You can consider them as variables or temporary storage for intermediate query results.\n\nWhen you define a CTE, you give it a name and specify the query that generates the result set. The CTE is then treated as a temporary table that exists only for the duration of the query. This temporary table is stored in memory or temporary storage space and can be referenced multiple times within the same query.\n\nThe advantage of using CTEs is that they allow you to break down complex queries into smaller, more manageable parts. You can define a CTE at the beginning of a query and then refer to it in subsequent parts of the query, treating it like a regular table. This enhances the readability, maintainability, and reusability of the query.\n\nIn essence, CTEs provide a way to store and reuse intermediate query results within the same query, acting as a temporary named storage or variable. However, it's important to note that CTEs do not persist beyond the execution of the query. They are specific to the scope of the query and are not accessible outside of it."

CTEs are scoped to the query in which they are defined and are not accessible outside of that query.\n\nEach query that needs to use a CTE must define it within that specific query. You cannot reuse the CTE name in separate or subsequent queries without redefining it.\n\nHowever, if you have multiple queries within the same batch or script, you can define the CTE once at the beginning of the batch or script, and then refer to it in subsequent queries within that same batch or script. This way, you avoid duplicating the CTE definition in each individual query within the batch or script.\n\nHere's an example to illustrate this:\n\n```sql\nWITH CTE AS (\n    SELECT * FROM MyTable\n)\n\nSELECT * FROM CTE;\n\n-- Other queries within the same batch can also reference the CTE\nSELECT * FROM CTE WHERE SomeColumn > 100;\n```\n\nIn this example, the CTE is defined at the beginning of the batch, and subsequent queries within the same batch can refer to the CTE by its name (`CTE`). This avoids duplicating the CTE definition in each subsequent query, but it still requires the CTE to be defined within the scope of each individual query.\n\nIt's important to note that CTEs are not persistent objects, and they exist only for the duration of the query or the batch in which they are defined.

As of my last update in September 2021, some of the lightest computer mice included:\n\n1. Logitech G Pro X Superlight: This mouse weighs just 63 grams, making it one of the lightest on the market.\n\n2. Finalmouse Ultralight 2: This mouse weighs around 47 grams, making it incredibly light.\n\n3. Glorious Model O: This mouse weighs around 67 grams.\n\n4. Cooler Master MM710: This mouse weighs about 53 grams.\n\n5. Razer Viper Mini: This mouse weighs approximately 61 grams.\n\nPlease note that these weights are approximate and may vary slightly between different units of the same model. Also, new models may have been released after my last update, so I would recommend checking the latest reviews and product listings for the most current information."

                            "That's a good start! Those skills and mindset are highly valued in many professional fields. In addition to problem solving and lifelong learning ability, it's also beneficial to highlight any specific technical or industry-related skills you may have. Here are a few suggestions on how to further develop your CV and portfolio:\n\n**CV:**\n\n1. **Personal Information:** Include your full name, contact information, and a professional title if applicable.\n\n2. **Objective Statement:** This is a brief section that clearly defines your career goals and highlights how your skills can benefit potential employers.\n\n3. **Skills:** This is where you will list your skills. It's beneficial to tailor this section to the job you're applying for. Include both hard and soft skills. For example, you've already mentioned \"problem solving\" and \"lifelong learning ability\". If you have any technical skills or knowledge of specific software, be sure to include that as well.\n\n4. **Experience:** Include your employment history. List your job title, the company name, the dates you were employed, and a list of your responsibilities and achievements. This section should communicate the value you brought to your previous roles.\n\n5. **Education:** List your educational background, including the school names, dates of attendance, and degrees or certifications earned.\n\n6. **References:** These can be included or you can state \"Available upon request\".\n\n**Portfolio:**\n\n1. **Work Samples:** Include examples of your work that showcase your skills. This could be anything from a project you've completed, a presentation you've created, a report you've written, or any other tangible example of your work.\n\n2. **Explanation of Each Piece:** For each piece of work you include, write a brief explanation of what it is, what your role was in its creation, and any positive results or feedback it received.\n\n3. **Professional Presentation:** Make sure your portfolio is well-organized and visually appealing. This is a representation of your professional self, so it's important that it looks clean and polished.\n\n4. **Contact Information:** Just like your CV, include your contact information so potential employers can easily reach out to you.\n\nRemember, the goal of your CV and portfolio is to sell yourself to potential employers. Every section should highlight your skills, experience, and the value you can bring to an organization. Good luck with your job search!"

Remember, a CV and a portfolio should showcase your abilities and experiences, and make it clear to the reader how these make you an excellent fit for the role you're applying for. \n\nFor the skills you've listed:\n\n1. **Problem Solving:** This is a highly sought after skill in many industries. Try to think of specific examples where you've used your problem-solving skills. What was the problem? How did you approach it? What was the result? This could be something from a previous job, a project you've worked on, or even a situation in your personal life.\n\n2. **Lifelong Learning Ability:** This is a fantastic skill to have, showing that you're adaptable and always looking to improve. You can demonstrate this through any courses or qualifications you've gained, or by discussing how you've learned from your experiences. \n\n3. **Well Rounded Experience:** This is a bit more general, but essentially you're saying you have a breadth of knowledge and experience. You could show this by listing a diverse range of roles and responsibilities you've had in your career, or a wide variety of projects you've completed.\n\nYour note about the value you can offer is very insightful. Remember, the aim of your CV and portfolio is to communicate your value to the reader. Everything you include should support this. \n\nBest of luck with creating your CV and portfolio! Let me know if you need any more advice or support."

Today is a competitive world and the smartest, best, and most qualified get paid a lot of\\n                                    money to work in amazing fields. But you don\\u2019t need a college degree, certification is an\\n                                    amazing path that opens up new opportunities and shows employers that you are the cream of\\n                                    the crop. We know that CompTIA certification will add some flair to that\\n                                    resume and help\\n                                    you get amazing new roles. Certification from CompTIA shows that you have the\\n                                    ability to be\\n                                    successful but it\\u2019s still not a simple process. You need to study, make your qualifications,\\n                                    and actually learn the skills to be successful at work if you want any chance of being\\n                                    successful. So we created CertLibrary. We found ourselves in the same boat, needing to learn theses\\n                                    skills to get amazing certifications. But so many resources offered strange takes on the\\n                                    actual exam or didn\\u2019t prep us in a meaningful way. CertLibrary is different because of this.\\n                                    We cut through the fluff and give meaningful exam preps, the exam preps we would want to\\n                                    study with if we were getting certified. Our Exam dumps offer real-world questions that\\n                                    simulate the exam room and job site, helping you get the core skills and critical abilities\\n                                    needed for not only CompTIA certification but your future career.

I adored the\\noriginal \u201cLegend of Zelda\u201d because it made the rural Midwestern world I grew up\\nin feel enigmatic, even mildly dangerous. My daughter is growing up in Los\\nAngeles, in the Hollywood Hills, otherwise known as the Land Without Yards\\nand Sidewalks.

I\u2019m not here to lionize the era I grew up in, much less the region, but\\nthere\u2019s something to be said for an impossibly elaborate sandbox world that\u2019s\\nfilled with peril and secrets but also doubles as a place for a kid like my daughter\\nto be a goal-less weirdo and goof.\\nYou lose that ability as an adult. Even when we\u2019re in situations overtly shaped by\\nplay, we see them merely as opportunities to exploit, expand and conquer. But\\nthe purest forms of play are not supposed to incline us to exploit. They\u2019re\\nsupposed to incline us to poke and prod and explore.\\nI know my daughter will eventually get to the epic adventure part of \u201cTears of the\\nKingdom,\u201d and I know that, one day, she\u2019ll even rescue Zelda, but not until she\u2019s\\nmade the game world her own and pushed its systems to their limit. Until then,\\nI\u2019ll happily watch her Ultrahand the most cockamamie wagon imaginable for her\\nhorse to drag up a mountainside. I\u2019ll watch her fill her inventory with mushroom\\nskewers and dubious food. I\u2019ll watch her sneak up on wild horses, in the interest\\nof breaking and taming them, even though her stable is already at capacity. I\u2019ll\\nwatch her dye her clothing orange, and then red, and then blue, and then orange\\nagain. Her life, I fear, as it plunges deeper into the 21st century, will be filled\\nwith far more Challenger disasters than Zelda releases. And so I\u2019ll tell her to\\nremember this \u2014 the feeling of a world that feels lifted, not collapsed;\\nconquerable, not corrupted; joyful, not terrifying. Remember this.

When I look back on developmental milestones, my\\ndaughter\u2019s first word, first step, first joke and first day of school are up there\\nwith her turning to me, grinning, after having finally figured out how to bypass\\nthe fiendish Hila Rao shrine in \u201cBreath of the Wild.\u201d This should explain her\\nanticipation for \u201cTears of the Kingdom,\u201d a direct sequel to \u201cBreath of the Wild\u201d\\n\u2014 only the second direct sequel in the 37-year history of the franchise.\\nI played Zelda as an impish detective, investigating the humblest corners of the\\ngame world, bombing every rock and burning down every bush in the hopes of\\nfinding a secret door. What my daughter most loved about \u201cBreath of the Wild,\u201d\\nconversely, was futzing around with its elaborate systems.

                            "Based on the information extracted from the document, here are the key points:\n\n1. \ud83c\udfae The article is written by Tom Bissell, an author and screenwriter, who shares his experiences watching his daughter play \"The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom\". He appreciates the game's ability to provide a form of unstructured play that his daughter, growing up in an urban environment, might not otherwise experience. \n\n2. \ud83e\udde9 The game is not just about fighting monsters, but also about wandering, thinking, and tinkering. It offers a sandbox world filled with peril and secrets, allowing players to explore and experiment. \n\n3. \ud83e\udde0 The author observes his daughter's cognitive development as she experiments with the game's mechanics, such as stopping time for an object, manipulating metallic objects with magnetism, and altering objects' midflight trajectories.\n\n4. \ud83c\udf73 The game's elaborate systems, such as the cooking system, allow players to mix and match over 100 ingredients, resulting in different outcomes. This aspect of the game is particularly enjoyed by the author's daughter.\n\n5. \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f A new ability in \"Tears of the Kingdom\" called Ultrahand allows players to construct various items from materials found in the game world. The author's daughter spends hours experimenting with this feature, building rafts and structures.\n\n6. \ud83d\udea3\u200d\u2640\ufe0f Despite the game's main objective of finding the lost Princess Zelda, the author's daughter prefers to explore and experiment, even invoking the Wright brothers as justification for her experimentation.\n\n7. \ud83c\udf0d The author hopes that his daughter will remember the joy and exploration of playing the game, as a contrast to the challenges she may face in the future.\n\nIn summary, the article is a heartfelt exploration of the author's experiences watching his daughter play \"The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom\", highlighting the game's emphasis on exploration, experimentation, and unstructured play.\n\n#VideoGames #TheLegendOfZelda #UnstructuredPlay #CognitiveDevelopment #Exploration"

Between all the Ultrahand R&D, my daughter was also chopping down\\ntrees and fusing together the resultant logs to make lean-to structures, just in\\ncase she came back to an area later and it was raining and she wanted to \u201ccook\\nsomething.\u201d (God help us all, you can cook in \u201cTears of the Kingdom,\u201d too.) At\\none point, sensing my impatience, my daughter invoked the Wright brothers as\\nher mathematical proof for the necessity of experimentation. What about all the\\nmonsters, I asked, the beasts and creatures she was duty-bound as Link to strike\\ndown with sword and bow? \u201cMeh,\u201d she said, shrugging. \u201cPass.\u201d\",\"metadata\":{\"source\":null,\"page_number\":5,\"author\":\"\"}},{\"doc_id\":\"13e387e3-e822-490d-aa91-b863ba79631d\",\"text\":\"Pass? I wanted to say to her. Pass? Fighting monsters is the whole point of the\\ngame! Which isn\u2019t even true, strictly speaking. \u201cTears of the Kingdom,\u201d like every\\nZelda game before it, is about wandering, thinking, tinkering. I adored the\\noriginal \u201cLegend of Zelda\u201d because it made the rural Midwestern world I grew up\\nin feel enigmatic, even mildly dangerous. My daughter is growing up in Los\\nAngeles, in the Hollywood Hills, otherwise known as the Land Without Yards\\nand Sidewalks. She can\u2019t walk outside our front door to play without putting\\nherself immediately in the path of some Porsche Cayenne doing 40 in a 15.\\nGames such as \u201cBreath of the Wild\u201d and \u201cTears of the Kingdom\u201d might be the\\nclosest approximation she has for the sort of unstructured play I took for granted\\nas a kid. I\u2019m not here to lionize the era I grew up in, much less the region, but\\nthere\u2019s something to be said for an impossibly elaborate sandbox world that\u2019s\\nfilled with peril and secrets but also doubles as a place for a kid like my daughter\\nto be a goal-less weirdo and goof.\\nYou lose that ability as an adult. Even when we\u2019re in situations overtly shaped by\\nplay, we see them merely as opportunities to exploit, expand and conquer. But\\nthe purest forms of play are not supposed to incline us to exploit. They\u2019re\\nsupposed to incline us to poke and prod and explore.\\nI know my daughter will eventually get to the epic adventure part of \u201cTears of the\\nKingdom,\u201d and I know that, one day, she\u2019ll even rescue Zelda, but not until she\u2019s\\nmade the game world her own and pushed its systems to their limit. Until then,\\nI\u2019ll happily watch her Ultrahand the most cockamamie wagon imaginable for her\\nhorse to drag up a mountainside. I\u2019ll watch her fill her inventory with mushroom\\nskewers and dubious food. I\u2019ll watch her sneak up on wild horses, in the interest\\nof breaking and taming them, even though her stable is already at capacity. I\u2019ll\\nwatch her dye her clothing orange, and then red, and then blue, and then orange\\nagain. Her life, I fear, as it plunges deeper into the 21st century, will be filled\\nwith far more Challenger disasters than Zelda releases. And so I\u2019ll tell her to\\nremember this \u2014 the feeling of a world that feels lifted, not collapsed;\\nconquerable, not corrupted; joyful, not terrifying. Remember this. And\\nremember us, too, together. Playing.\",\"metadata\":{\"source\":null,\"page_number\":6,\"author\":\"\"}}]}"
